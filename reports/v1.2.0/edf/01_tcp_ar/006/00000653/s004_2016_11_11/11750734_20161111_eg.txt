SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background demonstrated low voltage bilaterally symmetric 9-10 Hz rhythmic activity
posteriorly along with diffuse low-voltage beta activity.



During drowsiness and asleep attenuation alpha activity and diffuse low-voltage activity were seen.











At 2:17:00, the patient stopped talking, developed shivering movements of her head followed by
rhythmic shaking movements of her body. These were accompanied by muscle artifact but no other
abnormal changes in cerebral electrical activity. Movements subsided after 20 seconds and the
patient appeared to fall asleep, with previously noted diffuse slow voltage background activity seen.
At 2:23:35, the patient began mumbling and developed shivering and irregular side to side head
movements and shaking of her arms and legs, again accompanied by muscle artifact but no other
change in cerebral electrical activity. Movements subsided after 25 seconds and the patient
responded to questions, stating she was dreaming. Subsequently, she exhibited occasional
mumbling and irregular jaw movement accompanied by muscle artifact but without associated
epileptiform activity detected.






ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 86 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


Normal low voltage awake and asleep EEG. The patient demonstrated 2 episodes of mumbling,
decreased response to questioning, and irregular shivering and shaking movements as detailed
above. Both of these episodes appear to represent nonepileptic events, as they were accompanied
by muscle artifact but no change in cerebral electrical activity.
