HISTORY:

75 y.o. female with a history of HIV and

TB meningitis, with several weeks of altered mental status and a


seizure on 10/9/2015. LTM requested after unresponsiveness this

morning.



MEDICATIONS: Valproic acid, TB therapy


SEDATION: None listed



TECHNIQUE:

Continuous video digital  electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded


using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG. Seizure and spike detection




software was utilized.



-----------------------------------------------------------------

DAY 1 (Oct 9, 11:00 - 10/10/2016, 06:00)


Medications: see above


BACKGROUND: Markedly abnormal. Mildly slow on left while awake.

R hemisphere includes essentially continuous high amplitude R


spike with disruption of faster frequency



GENERALIZED SLOWING: modest on left


FOCAL SLOWING: continuous, R hemipshere



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:Abundant right posterior quadrant (T6 and

P4 max)

sharp-and-wave discharges. Often these become periodic at

1 Hz. There are also R hemispheric sharp waves and R brief bursts


of fast activity



EVENTS:

Electrographic seizures are noted intermittently, fewer than 1

per hour, ranging from 45 seconds to 3 minutes, notably:

1:29 PM


3:22 PM

8:55 PM


3:17 A

6:46 AM

7 AM



These are characterized by ictal build-up of theta, then alpha

frequency which evolves and then terminates abruptly.


The patient is intubated, and poorly arousable. No clinical

correlates are noted on the video with these seizures.



EKG: A single EKG lead captured 78 BPM





DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


Highly epileptiform pattern with PEDs + from the right

hemisphere, typically seen every 1.5 to 2 seconds, and


intermittent subclinical seizures.


-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 2 (Oct 10, 2015 - 10/11/2016, 08:00)


Medications: not provided

BACKGROUND: Markedly abnormal. The patient is not as awake in day

2. Mildly slow on left while awake.

R hemisphere includes essentially continuous high amplitude R


spike with disruption of faster frequency.  There background is

increasingly slow on left and more suppressed, aside from the


spikes, on the right.

GENERALIZED SLOWING: see above. By the AM of October 11, the EEG

is more discontinuous.



FOCAL SLOWING: continuous, R hemipshere



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Continuous right posterior quadrant (T6

and


P4 max or C4) sharp-and-wave periodic discharges. These are

periodic at


Hz. There are also R hemispheric sharp waves and R brief bursts

of fast activity





EVENTS:

Electrographic seizure at 8 AM with characteristic build up and


evolution of theta and alpha frequency on the right, and abrupt

termination.


EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 80 BPM





DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


Highly epileptiform pattern with PEDs + from the right

hemisphere, typically at a frequency of every 2-4 tseconds, and


one well defined subclinical seizure.  The ictal pattern is on a

continuum of a late status/PED pattern.   Later on the record is


more discontinuous, though there is no mention of additional AED

medicines.


DAY 3 (Oct 11, 2015 - 10/12/2016, 08:00)


Medications: not provided



BACKGROUND: Markedly abnormal. Slow with at times with a

discontinuous pattern  more discontinuous on the right.  More

continuous on the left.  Mostly wake and drowsy record.

GENERALIZED SLOWING: see above



FOCAL SLOWING: continuous, R hemipshere



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:The R PEDS have a periodicity of


approximately 0.3 Hz.  May be maximum P4 C4 T6 and have

associated faster frequency activity.



EVENTS: no clinical or electrographic seizures



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60 BPM





DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


Highly epileptiform pattern with PEDs + from the right

hemisphere, typically at an approximate frequency of every 3


seconds. No subclinical seizures.  The pverall pattern is on a

continuum of a late status/PED pattern, but there are no


definitive ictal findings.



-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 4 (10/12/15, 06:00 - 10/13/2015, 09:30)



Medications: Not provided


BACKGROUND: Markedly abnormal. Slow with at times with a


discontinuous pattern  more discontinuous on the right.



GENERALIZED SLOWING: See above.


FOCAL SLOWING: Continuous in R hemisphere.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Very rare left sharp waves.  R

sharp waves, spikes and PEDS gradually more blunted and less

periodic.




EVENTS: None



EKG: A single EKG lead captured 66 bpm.




DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION and  OVERALL IMPRESSION &


CLINICAL CORRELATION



No additional seizures noted since the AM of 10/10/2015.

Highly epileptiform pattern with PEDs + from the right

hemisphere, typically at an approximate frequency of every 3

seconds have Improved substantially in the last 24 hours, though


seen intermittently.
