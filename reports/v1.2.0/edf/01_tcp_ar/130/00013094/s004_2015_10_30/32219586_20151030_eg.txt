CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 49-year-old woman with multiple previous aneurysms, blindness status post clip with recurrent seizures and recent EEG monitoring.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Routine 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. There was no mention made of a craniotomy defect.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. There seems to be an underlying potential skull defect with head rocking artifact, and increase in amplitude in that region and also underlying focal slowing noted in the left frontal/frontotemporal region. This focal slowing was accentuated in drowsiness and in hyperventilation.
Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Focal slowing: Left frontal/frontotemporal, accentuated by hyperventilation drowsiness.
Sharp waves: Left frontal/frontotemporal seen in relaxed wakefulness with associated focal slowing and breach activity.
Photic stimulation present bilaterally with a more prominent supra hannonic pattern noted on the right. Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
	•	Focal slowing, left frontotemporal.
	•	In this sharply contoured background with probable underlying breach rhythm likely left frontotemporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Previous EEGs were not available for comparison. This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy and should be correlated with previous studies and imaging. No seizures were recorded.
