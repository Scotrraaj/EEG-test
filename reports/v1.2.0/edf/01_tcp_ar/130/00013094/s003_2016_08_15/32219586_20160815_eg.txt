HISTORY:

49 YR OLD  FEMALE WITH PRIOR HX OF MULTIPLE SEIZURES.
PMHX: LEFT ACA ANEURYSM CLIPPED   FOLLOW UP EEG.  STILL TAPERING MEDS.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 50 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG Hv, and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F7/T3 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
focal slowing in the left frontotemporal region



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


1. Intermittent focal slowing in the left frontotemporal region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the left
frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.


No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
