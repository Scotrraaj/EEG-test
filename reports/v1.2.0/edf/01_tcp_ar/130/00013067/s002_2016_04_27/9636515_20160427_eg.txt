DATE OF STUDY: 04/27/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 33 y.o. male with a history of seizures and microcephaly.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

daily.

mouth 2 times daily (with meals).

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 40 mg capsule, Please take 1 tablet 30 minutes prior to breakfast

on: 75 mg BID


divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth at bedtime.




cholecalciferol, vitamin D3, 3,000 unit Tablet, Take 3,000 Int'l Units/day by mouth daily.

quetiapine (SEROQUEL XR) 300 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 600 mg by mouth nightly.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Mild excess of polymorphic theta activity is seen.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.








Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


Mild diffuse slowing

No stage II sleep

No epileptiform discharges




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal 27 minute awake and drowsy EEG due to mild diffuse slowing.

This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.



No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
