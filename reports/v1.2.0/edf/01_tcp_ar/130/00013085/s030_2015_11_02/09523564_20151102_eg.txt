History:		45 YO FEMALE WITH PRIOR EEG. CONCERN PT IS SEIZING AGAIN. LEFT EYE DEVIATION AT TIMES. WILL RECORD FOR ONE HOUR
Medications:	Depakote and Phenobarbital. During the last 24 hours Versed was added. Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, obtunded, comatose

Description:
Background activity was characterized by a low voltage delta with infrequent theta and absence of a PDR or the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No sleep was seen. Epileptiform: Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges were now better seen in the left hemisphere at 1.5 to 2Hz. The discharge pattern consistent of polyspikes that would be seen concurrently occurring in the temporal region at times more anterior (F7) and with a more posterior lag (T5). No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged clinical sleep.
No clear seizures were seen
Hr was variable in the 60-70's bpm. One push button for gaze deviation does not demonstrate a clear change in the EEG pattern.
Summary of Findings:
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges), continuous, left hemispheric Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG for 2.5 Hrs because of left hemispheric PLEDs and diffuse slowing. This is consistent with an irritable epileptogenic focus in this region. There is also diffuse background slowing which is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction likely due at least in part to medication effect. No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
