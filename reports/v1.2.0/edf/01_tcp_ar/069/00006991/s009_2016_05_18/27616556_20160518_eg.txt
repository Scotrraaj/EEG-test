DATE OF STUDY: 05/18/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

 a 30 y.o. male with a history of TBI with subsequent seizures.  Patient is now
having episodes concerning for seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


topiramate (TOPAMAX) 50 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

LORazepam (ATIVAN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet if you feel like seizure is coming on

trazodone (DESYREL) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth nightly as needed for Sleep.


UNKNOWN TO PATIENT, daily. ?methylphenidate

ONABOTULINUMTOXINA (BOTOX IJ), Inject  as directed.

Ipratropium-Albuterol 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 mL Nebu, Inhale  into the lungs every 4 hours.


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 3 tablets by mouth 2 times daily for 360 days.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.






SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.



The background over the left consists of low amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity with an expected AP
(anterior-to-posterior) gradient.



There is weak posterior dominant rhythm over the right that consists of attenuated polymorphic 8-9 Hz
activity.  No AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient is present over the right.



Diffuse excess prominent beta activity is seen.



There is continuous polymorphic delta activity over the right anterior quadrant - frontocentral region.
Activity over the right central region (C4 lead mainly) is sharply contoured.





Sleep is characterized by vertex waves and sleep spindles that are seen over the left only.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No clear epileptiform discharges are seen.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  1-hour routine EEG due to:

1. Continuous right hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the right anterior quadrant -
frontocentral region.


2. Lack of clear sleep architecture over the right.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are indicative of a focal structural lesion over the right.



When compared to the prior EEGs, no clear epileptiform discharges are captured (despite presence
of sharply contoured activity over the right frontocentral region).



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
