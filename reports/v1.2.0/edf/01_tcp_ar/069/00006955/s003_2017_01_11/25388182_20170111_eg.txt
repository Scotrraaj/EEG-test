DATE OF STUDY: 01/11/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 33 y.o. male with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


QUETIAPINE FUMARATE (SEROQUEL PO), Take 800 mg by mouth.

sertraline (ZOLOFT) 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth daily.

alprazolam (XANAX) 0.25 mg tablet, Take 0.25 mg by mouth nightly as needed for Sleep.


trazodone (DESYREL) 100 mg tablet, Take 200 mg by mouth nightly.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None






TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Frequent symmetrical polymorphic delta activity is captured over the bilateral anterior temporal
regions.  It is less pronounced during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with poor cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.






IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild frequent symmetrical bilateral anterior temporal focal slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This finding is indicative of a focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  In this
patient, however, it may represent a normal variant since it mostly resolves during drowsiness.
