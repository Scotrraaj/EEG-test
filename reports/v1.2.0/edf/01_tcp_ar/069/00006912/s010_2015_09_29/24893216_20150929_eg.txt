SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.



Events were marked by the clinical staff. All clinical events as

well as extensive random background samples including

wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep were reviewed.



DAY 1 (9/29/2015, 11:29 - 9/30/2015, 08:00)



BACKGROUND:



The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized,

and consists predominantly of alpha moderate bifrontal beta


activity.

There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.


There is no generalized slowing.

There is abundant right temporal (T4 max) polymorphic slowing.


There is a right temporal (T4) max breach rhythm.



Sleep is characterized by symmetric spindles, K complexes, and

vertex waves.


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Rare right temporal (T4) spike and wave, activated by sleep


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or


detected.


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal video EEG due to:


1. Continuous right temporal (T4 max) polymorphic slowing.

2. Right temporal (T4) max breach rhythm.


3. Rare right temporal (T4) spike and wave, activated by sleep


These findings are consistent with right temporal cerebral

dysfunction and epileptogenic potentials.


A right temporal breach rhythm is consistent with the patient's

known history of craniotomy.

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): no change


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Following the seizure, occasional sharply contoured slowing is


seen over right temporal region



EVENTS: Two seizures are captured:



(1) DATE AND TIME:   10/1/2015 at 23:20

EVENT TYPE: Complex partial seizure


CLINICAL: Patient asleep in bed. Three seconds after

electrographic onset, she sits up, uncovers self, reaches for

event button with right hand. Picks blanket with left hand.

Forced left head deviation. Appears to reach for event button


with right hand, then stops. Continues to have forced head

deviation to left. Intermittent picking movements with left, then


right hand. Remains with forced head deviation to the left until

200 seconds after electrographic onset, when she stretches both

arms above her head and returns gaze midline, then back to left,

then midline, then somewhat back to left. Eyes cannot clearly be


seen. Wipes nose with left hand, then wipes face with left hand.

Forced head deviation towards left again. At 284 seconds she sits


up in bed. She intermittently continues to have forced head

deviation to the left. She takes off covers, gets out of bed, and

off camera. Nurse asks, "are you ok?" She is seen stumbling back

into bed, not responding to nurse. She fiddles with bedsheets


using right hand. After electrographic offset, she is confused

but is able to answer


EEG: 1 Hz right temporal (T4 max) sharp waves are followed by 6

Hz sharply contoured theta over the right temporal (T4) region,

which spreads within 2 seconds to the right parasagittal region,

increasing in amplitude and becoming more sharply contoured. This


ictal activity spreads diffusely by 12 seconds but continues to

evolve most prominently over the right temporal region,


developing into spikey alpha activity, then slowing to delta with

embedded spikes. Ictal activity remains most prominent over the

right temporal region until electrographic offset, 6 min 22 sec

after onset.


DURATION: 6 min 22 sec

POSTICTAL CHANGES:  Attenuation over bilateral temporal regions


that recovers

EKG: HR increases from 66 bpm (baseline) to 120 bpm on a single


EKG lead



(2) DATE AND TIME:   10/2/2015 at 03:17

EVENT TYPE: Complex partial seizure with secondary generalization


CLINICAL: Patient is asleep in bed. 39 seconds into

electrographic onset, she opens her eyes and has forced head/gaze

deviation to the left. She is seen moving her left hand under the

covers. Someone on her right says, "are you ok?" She does


not respond and continues looking to the left. She lets out a cry

at 74 seconds, then raises both arms (left first) above her head,


then develops a

the right arm flexed. She has tonic and rhythmic clonic movements

of both arms. Her mouth is open and she makes grunting noises.

Towards the end of the seizure she has slight right head


deviation. The seizure ends with a right sided twitch. Afterwards

she is comatose with deep breathing.


EEG: out of the asleep background there is 1 second of

attenuation over the right temporal leads (less so over

parasagittal leads), followed by a sharply contoured slow wave

diffusely over the right temporal region. This is followed by


onset of spikey 9 Hz activity over the right hemisphere which

slows to theta activity with embedded spikes, then delta activity


(at this point, the activity evolves best over the right temporal

region). Rhythmic ictal activity spreads diffusely but evolves

best over the right hemisphere, then increases to spikey alpha,

evolving best over the right temporal region, until it spreads


diffusely and the record becomes obscured by tonic, followed by

clonic, muscle artifact.


DURATION: 3 min 17 sec

POSTICTAL CHANGES:  Background is attenuated diffusely, but more

so on the right. It returns to baseline over the course of 30

min.


EKG: baseline HR 72 bpm, increases to 138 bpm during the

convulsion





DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



Two complex partial seizures (the latter with secondary

generalization) that evolve best over the right temporal region


on EEG. These seizures are semiologically consistent with focal

seizures of right hemisphere origin.

Background unchanged.

Home meds restarted:


Keppra 500 BID

Vimpat 200 BID


Ativan 0.5 BID


DAY 4 (10/2/2015, 08:00 - 10/3/2015, 08:00)

BACKGROUND: no change


GENERALIZED SLOWING: none

FOCAL SLOWING: no change


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none

SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Rare right temporal (T4) spike and wave, activated by sleep

EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



This is an abnormal video EEG due to:

1. Continuous right temporal (T4 max) polymorphic slowing.

2. Right temporal (T4) max breach rhythm.


3. Rare right temporal (T4) spike and wave, activated by sleep




-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 5 (10/3/2015, 08:00 - 10/3/2015, 11:02)

BACKGROUND: no change


GENERALIZED SLOWING: no change

FOCAL SLOWING: no change

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none

SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: none


EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


No change





-----------------------------------------------------------------

FINAL IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal video EEG due to:



1. Continuous right temporal (T4 max) polymorphic slowing


2. Right temporal (T4) max breach rhythm.

3. Rare right temporal (T4) spike and wave, activated by sleep

4. Two complex partial seizures (the latter with secondary

generalization) that evolve best over the right temporal region


on EEG. These seizures are semiologically consistent with focal

seizures of right hemisphere origin.



FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are consistent with localization related epilepsy

of right temporal origin. The study is also consistent with right


temporal cerebral dysfunction. The right temporal breach rhythm

is consistent with this patient's known history of craniotomy.
