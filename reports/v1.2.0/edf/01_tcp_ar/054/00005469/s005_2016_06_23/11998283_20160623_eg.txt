DATE OF STUDY: 06/23/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 61 y.o. female with a history of maturity, learning disability,hearing loss,
epilepsy and emotional stress referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.


Recently, she's been having more headaches with visual phenomenon.

MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

hydrOXYzine (ATARAX) 25 mg tablet,

levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet,


VENTOLIN HFA 90 mcg/actuation inhaler,

PARoxetine (PAXIL) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth every morning.

betamethasone dipropionate 0.05 % ointment, Apply to nose and cover with tegaderm (Patient
taking differently: Apply  topically daily. Apply to nose and cover with tegaderm)


triamcinolone (KENALOG) 0.1 % ointment, Apply twice a day to rash on nose, hand and arms
(Patient taking differently: Apply 1 Application topically as needed. Apply twice a day to rash on
nose, hand and arms)



ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 800 mg tablet, Take 800 mg by mouth as needed.

OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 300 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.



docusate sodium (COLACE) 100 mg capsule, Take 100 mg by mouth 2 times daily as needed for
Constipation.


aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

furosemide (LASIX) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed.

Albuterol (PROVENTIL,VENTOLIN) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs as
needed.
fluticasone (FLOVENT HFA) 220 mcg/Actuation inhaler, Inhale 1 puff into the lungs every 12 hours.


cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth 3 times daily as needed.


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a low-voltage, diffusely slow but
symmetric mixture of alpha and theta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present.   There is generous beta noted.  The alpha rhythm is scant




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles POSTS and K complexes



Generalized slowing is present.

No significant focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:





Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are 0no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. modest generalized slowing

CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with a bihemispheric disorder as described above.
No epileptiform features were identified.




Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
