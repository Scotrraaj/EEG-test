DATE OF STUDY: 08/19/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: , awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 65 y.o. female with a history of TGA ,provoked sz vs epilepsy,
currently seizure free referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth at bedtime.


aspirin EC 325 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

CYANOCOBALAMIN, VITAMIN B-12, (VITAMIN B-12 PO), Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

GLUCOSAMINE/CHONDROITIN SULF A (GLUCOSAMINE-CHONDROITIN PO), Take 1,500 mg by
mouth daily.


triamcinolone (NASACORT) 55 mcg nasal inhaler, Inhale 2 sprays into the nose daily.


cetirizine (ZYRTEC) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.

ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet, Take 325 mg by mouth daily (with breakfast).

Calcium Carbonate-Vitamin D3 (CALCIUM 600 WITH VITAMIN D3) 600 mg(1,500mg) -400 unit
Capsule, Take 2 tablets by mouth daily.



MULTIVITAMIN PO, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

acetaminophen (TYLENOL ARTHRITIS) 650 mg CR tablet, Take 650 mg by mouth every 8 hours as
needed.




TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HVand photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz , 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: produces an increase in amplitude of the background


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.   There is also supraharmonic driving.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
