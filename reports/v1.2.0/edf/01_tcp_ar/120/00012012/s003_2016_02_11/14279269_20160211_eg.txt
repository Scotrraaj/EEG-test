HISTORY:

68 y.o. male with a history of ICH, CVA,

admitted with multiple metabolic abnormalities and acute subacute


nonhemorrhagic infarcts in the bilateral medial thalami and right

superior ventral midbrain, which could be seen the setting of

artery of Percheron infarct or central venous thrombosis. Age


advanced cerebral atrophy, marked chronic small vessel ischemic

change and scattered lacunar infarcts.  Chronic left MCA

territory infarct referred for routine EEG for characterization


of change in mental status.

SEDATION: None

TECHNIQUE:


A bedside portable 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

tactile/verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The  background is markedly abnormal, characterized by an


asynchronous, at times almost burst suppression like pattern with

bursts of 4-7 Hz activity, which can be higher amplitude on the

left. At times the right is more attenuated. When continuous, the

primary frequencies are theta and delta



Generalized slowing is present.


Focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional (1/hour to <1min) Left temporal T1 max



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is  reactivity to  auditory,

tactile, or noxious stimuli. The EEG is more continuous with


stimulation



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal bedside routine EEG due to:

1. Replacement of normal background with marked background


slowing

2. Intermittent burst suppression or attenuation pattern


3. Amplitude asymmetry with few sharp waves on left


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are suggestive of a severe bihemispheric process.


There are likely both acute and chronic CNS contributors to this

pattern. No seizures were recorded. The reactivity to stimuli is


a positive finding.
