HISTORY:

42 y.o. female with a history of staring

spells remain and  is told that she laughs during them,  referred


for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

carBAMazepine (CARBATROL) 200 mg 12 hr capsule, Take 2 capsules

by mouth 2 times daily.


amitriptyline (ELAVIL) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth

nightly.

fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray, Inhale 2


sprays into the nose daily.

PRENATAL VITS #90/IRON FUM/FA (PRENATAL VIT NO.90-IRON FUM-FA) 9

mg iron- 500 mcg Tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.






No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A one hour, digital video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)

was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV, and


photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.7

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, POSTS sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  Sleep was not

sustained.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual,


auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal  1 hour awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
