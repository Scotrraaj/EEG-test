HISTORY:

82 y.o. WOMAN WITH PMHX OF SZS.  HAS BEEN SZ FREE SINCE 2002.
CHECK UP.  PRIOR EEG 2009





MEDICATIONS:

TEGRETOL



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a moderately well organized symmetric
mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left more than right midtemporal regions
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



1. Intermittent focal slowing in the left more than right midtemporal regions


CLINICAL CORRELATION:







This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the left more
than right midtemporal regions.  These findings are indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
