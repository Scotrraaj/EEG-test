69 y.o. male with a history of CHF, cardiac

arresst referred for EEG for hypothermia protocol, no history of

seizures

daily.

current facility-administered medications for this visit not


provided



SEDATION: propofol


TECHNIQUE:

A 48 hour continuous video21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)


was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

tactile stimulation.  Patient was treated with the hypothermia

protocol.




DAY 1 ( 9 AM - 04/02/2016- 4/3/2016, 06:00)  Temperature not


provided.


BACKGROUND:

EEG all muscle artifact  otherwise low voltage and suppressed.


Not reactive, not variable



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



EVENTS: None


EKG: A single lead captured HR 72 BPM



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

No seizures, low voltage pattern, mostly obscured by muscle.


Team aware








-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 2 (04/03, 06:00 - 4/4/2016, 06:00)

Temperature not provided


Medicines: Propofol, then Propofol wean. Use of Neuromuscular

blockage at mid-day on 4-3-16


BACKGROUND: Initially: EEG all muscle artifact  otherwise low

voltage and suppressed. Not reactive, not variable. Then with NMB

agent, low voltage, slow with subtle bifrontal GPED without

evolution. Overtime, transitions to low voltage slow pattern. Has


some theta, but not reactive.

GENERALIZED SLOWING: marked



FOCAL SLOWING: None


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: blunted GPEDS, bi frontal



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 96- 120





DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


On this Sunday transitions from low voltage suppressed pattern

with blunted GPEDs to more mixed frequency pattern.   No


seizures, no spikes

Tactile and verbal stimulation was limited on 4-4-16 but EEG does


not appear to be reactive.



IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


No epileptiform features noted. This slow pattern should be

correlated with Neurological exam and other neurodiagnostic


tests.
