HISTORY:

epilepsy in childhood and young adulthood in the setting of


chronic encephalopathy, now well-controlled, referred for routine

EEG for characterization of seizures.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies,

with a symmetric and reactive 7.8-5 Hertz posterior dominant

rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of


frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.



During mild drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the

posterior dominant rhythm is seen.



Sleep is not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.


There is occasional subtle left temporal polymorphic slowing.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Occasional subtle left temporal polymorphic slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of left temporal cerebral

dysfunction superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


EEGs performed in 2012 and 2008 document mild diffuse cerebral

dysfunction. EEGs prior to that document left temporal slowing.
