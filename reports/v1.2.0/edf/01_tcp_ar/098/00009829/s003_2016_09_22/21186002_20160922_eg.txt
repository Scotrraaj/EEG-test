DATE OF STUDY: 09/22/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 29 y.o. male with a history of autism, childhood epilepsy, seizure free for three
years,  referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.


Young man, product of normal L&D but found to have several dysmorphisms in infancy. GMa recalls
renal/ureteral abnormalities, developmental delay, profoundly delayed speech and epilepsy.


Epilepsy controlled for some time but recurred 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013.

MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, (VITAMIN D) 1,000 unit Tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. Indications:
COMPLEX-PARTIAL EPILEPSY


ibandronate (BONIVA) 150 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 30 days. Take one (1) tablet
once per month in the morning with a full glass of water, on an empty stomach.


amLODIPine (NORVASC) 5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.


Generous frontal is a normal finding

CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
