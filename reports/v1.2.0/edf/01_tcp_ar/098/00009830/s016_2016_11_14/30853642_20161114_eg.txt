HISTORY:

24 y.o. female with a history of severe epilepsy after treatment of
posterior fossa medulloblastoma, developmental delay, cortical visual impairment, obstructive
hydrocephalus s/p shunt 2002. This is a follow up routine EEG for characterization of seizures. Per
notes, pt had seizure episode 11/13 ("like the ones she has at home where her eyes close and she
becomes apneic and vomited afterwards"), loaded with 200mg of PHB.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric.

The left hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of mostly alpha with admixed beta and
excess polymorphic delta. There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 8.5-9 Hz.


The right hemisphere is consists of disorganized delta with attenuated faster frequencies. There is no
posterior dominant rhythm on the right.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured



Mild generalized slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Continuous right hemisphere slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of right hemispheric cortical dysfunction, likely structural in
etiology, superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


The degree of background slowing is similar to that described from the routine EEG performed 10/31,
and has improved compared with most recent long term monitoring study.
