 HISTORY: 24 y.o. female with a history of severe epilepsy after treatment of posterior fossa medulloblastoma, developmental delay, cortical visual impairment, obstructive hydrocephalus s/p shunt 2002, referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures and assessment of mental status change.  Per chart review, most recent characterization of her epilepsy includes brief 10 second seizures with LE trembling or stiffening, may cross the R leg over left, seems uncomfortable during the seizure. L O1 seizures occur out of wake or sleep and include 60-80 seconds of fast activity without clear clinical change.  Tech notes skull defect near F4, C4, P4 and that patient is plegic on the left.

Eslicarbazepine started 11/1 evening (unable to be administered prior to this as it is non-formulary).  
SEDATION: None  
TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record at times due to bitemporal muscle artifact impeding interpretation over these regions. The study included a single channel of EKG.   
DAY 1 (10/31/2016, 12:41 - 11/1/2016, 15:37)  
BACKGROUND:  Leads are disconnected 10/31 14:25-16:54.  The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric. The left hemisphere consists of fairly organized alpha, theta, and delta. Fragments of a posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz are present, best seen over the left parasagittal chain. The right hemisphere consists of continuous delta with attenuated faster frequencies. There is no posterior dominant rhythm.  Sleep is characterized by rudimentary sleep spindles and K complexes, seen only over the left hemisphere.  There is mild generalized slowing.  
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  1. Frequent runs of medium amplitude (100-150 uV) delta over the right anterior quadrant (Fp2/F8/T4/F4/C4), which likely represents breach rhythm 2. Occasional bursts of medium amplitude (100-150 uV) sharply contoured theta over the left frontal (F3 max) region, which may represent spread of breach rhythm.  
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Occasional right temporal (T2/F8>T4 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 2. Frequent left frontal (F3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 3. Occasional left fronto-temporal (F7/T3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes, at times synchronous with and other times independent of #2  
EVENTS:  10/31/2016 at 19:53 (30 sec duration) - electrographic seizure 

CLINICAL: video view is blocked by caregivers at bedside, who appear to be closely watching patient. House officer confirms no clinical signs. EEG: rhythmic theta over the left hemisphere, maximal over left temporal (T3) region, develops into frank sharp-and-wave, slows in frequency and increases in amplitude before offset EKG: HR increases to 140s  11/1/2016 at 08:58 (20 sec duration) - electrographic seizure 
CLINICAL: No definite correlation. 6 seconds prior to clear electrographic onset (note that interpretation impaired by left temporal muscle artifact), patient opens her eyes, revealing left gaze preference. This sign persists after electrographic offset. EEG: same as seizure #1, with onset of rhythmic theta maximal over left temporal (T3) region EKG: baseline HR 119 bpm, ictal HR 126 bpm, postictal HR 119 bpm  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 90s-100s  

FINAL IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Excess of theta frequencies (mild generalized slowing) and suboptimal organization 2. Continuous slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere 3. Breach rhythm as above 4. Occasional right temporal sharp-and-wave complexes 5. Occasional left frontal (F3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 6. Occasional left fronto-temporal (F7/T3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 7. Two left temporal electrographic seizure, associated with tachycardia, as above   

FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are diagnostic for localization related epilepsy of left temporal origin. There is additional evidence for epileptogenic potential arising from the left frontal and right temporal regions, as well as right hemispheric cortical dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
