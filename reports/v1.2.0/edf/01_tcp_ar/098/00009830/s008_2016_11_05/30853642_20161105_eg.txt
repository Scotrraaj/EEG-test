SEDATION: None  
TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically record due to periods of diffuse (bitemporal predominant) muscle artifact. The study included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/5/2016, 17:26 - 11/6/2016, 06:00)  

BACKGROUND:  At start of the study, the waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric. The left hemisphere consists of fairly organized alpha, theta, and delta. Fragments of a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz are present, best seen over the left parasagittal chain. The right hemisphere consists of continuous delta with attenuated faster frequencies. There is no posterior dominant rhythm.  Sleep transients are not captured.  There is mild generalized slowing.  As study progresses and electrographic seizures are noted, the patient is treated with Ativan followed by versed drip. Background becomes disorganized alpha, beta, and delta, and asymmetry between the hemispheres less distinct.   
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Occasional right temporal (T2/F8>T4 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 2. Frequent left frontal (F3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 3. Occasional left fronto-temporal (F7/T3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes, at times synchronous with and other times independent of #2 4. Rare runs of 2 Hz left temporal lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA, also known as TIRDA) for < 10 sec 5. Frequent left occipital (O1) sharp waves   
EVENTS:  Two patterns of electrographic seizure activity are noted: left occipital and bifrontal.  Pattern #1 - L occipital electrographic seizures 11/5/2016 at 17:26, 18:40, 19:31, 20:10, 20:27, 20:29, 20:42, 21:17, 22:08, 22:18, 22:39 11/6/2016 at 01:09, 01:39, 01:58, 02:19, 02:52, 02:58, 03:05, 03:26, 03:46 
CLINICAL: no definite correlate; rare, intermittent right gaze deviation (20:27) EEG: onset of beta over the left occipital region, which slows to rhythmic alpha, then theta and spreads over right occipital region. At offset, there is semi-rhythmic alpha, but some seizures have left occipital periodic discharges at offset. Note that onset of first seizure is not captured, but its evolution appears consistent with other seizures (rhythmic theta over the left hemisphere, maximal over left occipital region, which sharpens in morphology and reflects over the right occipital region before dissolving into semi-rhythmic alpha). Most last 1-3 min, rarely last up to 6 min. EKG: no change in HR, which is in 120s  Pattern #2 - Bifrontal electrographic seizures / highly epileptogenic discharges First noted 11/5/2016 21:14; definite seizures at 22:54, 23:00; 11/6/2016 at 04:21, 04:31, 04:38, 05:24, 05:27 with highly epileptogenic buzzes after this time 
CLINICAL: no definite clinical correlate EEG: onset and offset is indistinct, and pattern is not always definitely evolving. These are characterized by beta buzzes, slowing to alpha frequency and increasing in amplitude before offset. At first, these discharges may be considered BIRDs (Brief Ictal/Interictal Rhythmic Discharges). As day progresses, these evolve more clearly and last up from 15 sec - 2 min, but onset-offset remains unclear. These occur back-to-back.   EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 120s  

DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: 1. Excess of theta frequencies (mild generalized slowing) and suboptimal organization 2. Continuous slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere 3. Occasional right temporal sharp-and-wave complexes 4. Occasional left frontal (F3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 5. Occasional left fronto-temporal (F7/T3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 6. Two patterns of electrographic seizure activity are noted: left occipital and bifrontal   These findings are diagnostic for localization related epilepsy of left occipital and bifrontal origin. There is additional evidence for epileptogenic potential arising from the left frontal and right temporal regions, as well as right hemispheric cortical dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction which worsens over the course of the study, likely related to medication effect (Ativan, versed).  Note that the ictal patterns described in this study are distinct from the left temporal seizures captured during previous LTM EEG, 10/31-11/1/2016.  
----------------------------------------------------------------- 

 DAY 2 (11/6/2016, 06:00 - 11/7/2016, 06:00)  

MEDICATIONS: Uptitration of versed gtt to 1, then 2 mg/kg/hr Keppra load of 60 mg/kg followed by 500 q12h  *study disconnected 11/6 18:23-19:15  
BACKGROUND: increasingly slow and disorganized, consisting of delta with superimposed faster frequencies, poor organization. By 11/6 19:00, background develops periods of increasing attenuation, with low amplitude delta. Throughout the night, background intermittently obscured by diffuse (bitemporal-predominant) muscle artifact.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: severe  FOCAL SLOWING: right hemisphere attenuation is less pronounced as overall background slows  
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  
SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: see "events"  
EVENTS:   Pattern #1 - Left occipital electrographic seizures Not noted on this day  Pattern #2 - Bifrontal electrographic seizures / highly epileptogenic discharges Continue on this day, mostly as buzzes of beta/alpha activity; occasionally as evolving electrographic seizures (examples include 11/6/2016 at 05:24, 05:26, 05:27, 10:09, 11:28, 14:59, 16:24 x2). These evolve less clearly by 11/6 16:30.  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 120s   

DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Bifrontal seizure activity continues. Left occipital seizure activity has resolved Severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, likely associated at least in part with medication effect. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------  

DAY 3 (11/7/2016, 06:00 - 11/8/2016, 06:00)  
BACKGROUND:  Initially burst suppression.  Bursts consist of frontally predominant alpha and beta for <1 sec. Suppression lasts 5 sec up to several minutes  By 11/7 12:00, background becomes discontinuous (<50% attenuation). Periods of diffuse disorganized alpha, beta, and theta alternate with attenuated background.  By 11/7 15:00, background is often obscured by diffuse muscle artifact, particularly over the temporal regions. Muscle artifact becomes less prevalent by 17:00. Bursts consist of disorganized theta, 10-40 sec in duration.  By 11/7 21:00, background becomes nearly continuous mix of disorganized, nonevolving theta and alpha activity.  Background continues to shift between the above described patterns (long periods of burst-attenuation, discontinuity, near continuity). The background may be obscured by bitemporal muscle artifact for hours at a time.  GENERALIZED SLOWING:  Severe   FOCAL SLOWING: right hemisphere attenuation is more subtle on this day  
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  
SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: 1. Frequent left frontotemporal (F7/T3) sharp waves  
EVENTS: Rarely, bursts of frontally predominant beta slow to alpha, then theta, then delta range, increasing in amplitude before offset There is no clinical correlate These bursts often have indistinct onset and offset Examples occur 11/7 at 09:18, 10:26 Duration: 10-70 seconds   EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 120s   

DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Pattern of burst suppression, which becomes discontinuous background, then nearly continuous. Activity consists of theta and alpha frequencies; whereas this activity previously evolved into seizures, it no longer clearly does by end of day.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------  

DAY 4 (11/8/2016, 06:00 - 11/9/2016, 06:00)  
BACKGROUND: Background continues to shift between long periods of burst-attenuation, discontinuity, near continuity. The background may be obscured by bitemporal muscle artifact for hours at a time.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: severe  FOCAL SLOWING:  1. Right hemisphere attenuation more pronounced on this day 2. Frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  
SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Frequent left frontotemporal (F7/T3) sharp waves 2. Runs of 2 Hz lateralized rhythmic delta activity over the left hemisphere for <10 seconds (LRDA)  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in 120s   

DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Same degree of background slowing as on day 3. Frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing. Continuous right hemisphere attenuation. Frequent left temporal epileptogenic potentials. No clinical or electrographic seizures reported or detected.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------  
DAY 5 (11/9/2016, 06:00 - 11/9/2016, 09:07)  

BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  
SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No change  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 110s-120s   
DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change.   
-----------------------------------------------------------------  
FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Excess of theta frequencies (mild generalized slowing) and suboptimal organization, worsening to severe generalized slowing over the course of the study 2. Continuous slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere 3. Occasional right temporal sharp-and-wave complexes 4. Occasional left frontal (F3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 5. Occasional left fronto-temporal (F7/T3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 6. Two patterns of electrographic seizure activity are noted: left occipital and bifrontal   
FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are diagnostic for localization related epilepsy of left occipital and bifrontal origin. There is additional evidence for multifocal epileptogenic potential as detailed above, as well as right hemispheric cortical dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction which worsens over the course of the study, likely related to medication effect (Ativan, versed).  Note that the ictal patterns described in this study are distinct from the left temporal seizures captured during previous LTM EEG, 10/31-11/1/2016.
