SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

Background activity was characterized by diffuse alpha/theta activity seen only over the left
hemisphere. At time a posterior dominant rhythm is seen and reaches at best 9Hz.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity and attenuation of faster frequencies is present in the right
hemisphere maximal in the centro-temporal  region during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional (1/hour to <1min) sharp waves seen at F8/T4> F3 and F7/T3



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None






ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 114 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Sharp waves in the right anterior temporal region, left frontal and left anterior temporal region.


2. Continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere and attenuation

3. Intermittent focal slowing in the left mid-temporal region

4. Mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to multifocal sharp waves, which is
consistent with multiple foci of irritability that are potentially epileptogenic. In addition there is
continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere and attenuation. This finding is indicative of severe
focal cortical dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin. Lastly there is intermittent focal
slowing in the left mid-temporal region region and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which
are non-specific with regards to etiology.  This patient will be placed on LTM.
