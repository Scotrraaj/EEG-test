HISTORY:

24 y.o. female with a history of medulloblastoma in 1999, cortical
visual loss, developmental delay, hydrocephalus, VP shunt, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of
possible meningitis and seizure activity.

SEDATION: Versed



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically suboptimal record
with excessive 60 cycle artifact, and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient was intubated, unresponsive during the study. Background activity is characterized by 8-
10 Hz rhythmic activity over central and left greater than right temporoparietal regions intermixed
with moderate amounts of medium amplitude 3-6 Hz activity, also higher in amplitude on the left.
Occasional vertex and left paracentral medium amplitude sharply contoured slow waves were seen
suggestive of vertex sleep activity. In addition, occasional brief runs of medium amplitude rhythmic
5-6 Hz activity were seen over central and left hemispheric scalp regions. A large amount of 60 cycle
artifact was seen in several channels, obscuring underlying cerebral electrical activity.







EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep bedside EEG due to:


1. Diffuse background slowing and disorganization.

2. Interhemispheric asymmetry with voltage and frequency attenuation on the right.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate a bihemispheric functional disturbance, greater over the right hemisphere,
with no clinical or electrographic seizures and with no definite pathologic paroxysmal epileptiform
discharges recorded.
