 HISTORY: 61 y.o. male with a history of recurrent status epilepticus- earlier today R sided shaking and gaze deviation, now just has eye lid twitch but is responsive during seizures. referred for EEG for treatment of status epilepticus.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: aspirin EC tablet 81 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg valproate (DEPACON) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB losartan (COZAAR) tablet 25 mg metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 24 hr tablet 25 mg  SEDATION:ativan  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a   technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. BP 136/87 (BP Location: Left arm)  Pulse 71  Temp 98 °F (36.7 °C) (Oral)  Resp 20  SpO2 99%  DAY 1 (10/6/2016, 17:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is  continuous,  asymmetric, with left frontal breach Posterior dominant rhythm was not present. The background is  reactive,  variable. There were  persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. Sleep was captured. PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Low    amplitude periodic left frontal sharp waves or spikes are noted particularly after midnight, after the patient received additional medications   EVENTS:  This EEG monitor demonstrates periods with repetitive focal seizures.  Some of the seizures are difficult to delineate from craniotomy defect and eye movement but there is a clear pattern of paroxysmal fast activity in the left frontal region with frequency evolution, typically of 20-40 seconds in duration.  Seizures seem to be exacerbated at approximately 7:30 10 PM and again 3 AM. Clinical features, when present include eyeblink.  The patient demonstrated preserved responsiveness during the seizures.  Treatments included IV Keppra, midazelam and Vimpat.  Each therapy produced at least briefly and improvement in the ictal pattern EKG: A single lead captured 80 BPM 

 DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1 L FC focal slowing 2.  Repetitive electrographic seizures from the left frontocentral region, occurring despite breach and eyeblink artifact.  The epochs with sustained seizures are compatible with an intermittent status epilepticus pattern

 DAY2(10/7/2016 - 10/8/2016, 10:00) Current Facility-Administered Medications: lacosamide (VIMPAT) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB aspirin EC tablet 81 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg valproate (DEPACON) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB losartan (COZAAR) tablet 25 mg metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 24 hr tablet 25 mg insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 4,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB  BACKGROUND: As the EEG monitor continues, the patient is increasingly awake with eye movements noted on the background, a posterior dominant rhythm noted on the right and a more continuous pattern on the left  GENERALIZED SLOWING: Improving  FOCAL SLOWING: Market from the left frontocentral region   PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:   L frontal fast activity   EVENTS:  1. Intermittent bursts of repetitive fast activity are noted particularly in the morning of the seventh.  By the afternoon, these seem to be abating. 2. The nurses noted one or two R thumb twitches without clear EEG change.  EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 72 BPM  DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION and final conclusion  This remains a markedly abnormal EEG.  There is a prominent breach rhythm and prominent intermittent fast activity from the left frontocentral region.  However, clinical seizures appear to have stopped and the overall mental status has improved. A simple partial seizure characterized only by thumb twitching may not necessarily having EEG signature. The frontal fast activity likely represents a seizure, but given the dramatic improvement in mental status, this may not merit acceleration of AED therapy.
