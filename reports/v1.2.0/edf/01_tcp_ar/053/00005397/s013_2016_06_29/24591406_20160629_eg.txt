HISTORY: a 61 y.o. male 61 YR MALE PRESENTS WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS.  CHRONIC BL SDH WITH ACUTE WORSENING, H/O LEFT MCA STROKE.  MEDICATIONS: VERSED, ATIVAN, KEPPRA, DILANTIN, TOPIRAMATE, DEPAKOTE  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (6/29/2016, 18:00 - 6/30/2016, 08:00)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta and activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. After the first 2 hours an asymmetry can be seen with attenuation of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere.   Over the right there is diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity seen.   Sleep was limited at the end of the record and characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured..  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Frequent low amplitude FP1 maximal with a large field sharp waves.  EVENTS: None  EKG: A single lead captured 66bpm  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Left prefrontal sharp waves and left hemisphere attenuation, these findings are consistent with a focus of structural dysfunction and irritability over that region. In addition there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  Reading attending:

DAY 2 (06/30/2016, 08:00 - 7/1/2016, 12:00)   EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is best seen over the right hemisphere. It is reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of frontal beta activity,fairly organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) seen only over the right hemisphere, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   Left hemisphere continuous polymorphic delta and attenuation of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere.   Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with vertex waves and sleep spindles seen best over the right hemisphere . Slow wave sleep was seen.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Frequent low amplitude FP1 maximal with a large field sharp waves. At time seen periodically at 1 Hz.  EVENTS: None  EKG: A single lead captured 66bpm  DAY 2  IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to left prefrontal sharp waves and left hemisphere attenuation, these findings are consistent with a focus of structural dysfunction and irritability over that region. In addition there is improvement of the diffuse background slowing from the day prior.  Reading attending:
