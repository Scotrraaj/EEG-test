HISTORY:

61 y.o. male with a history of severe, refactory epilepsy with repetitive episodes
focal status  referred for routine EEG for treatment of status epilepticus.Earlier today R sided shaking
and gaze deviation, now just has eye lid twitch but is responsive during seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


aspirin EC tablet 81 mg

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg

valproate (DEPACON) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB


levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

losartan (COZAAR) tablet 25 mg

metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 24 hr tablet 25 mg


sinsulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units


SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:


A STAT portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and  Stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of an organized  By asymmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a  reactive  9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present, more so on the left.  Excess beta
is seen.  The left hemisphere is characterized by left frontal breach, paucity of a PDR and prominent
fast activity.



Left frontocentral  focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

The EEG opens with a clinical seizure characterized by eye blinking.  By 17:19 an ictal pattern is
defined with frontocentral fast activity including 10-19 Hz activity.  This evolves over 2 minutes to
more of a focal delta with some artifact and breach rhythm.  Patient is responsive during the
discharge.  The right hemisphere demonstrates diffuse beta activity during the seizure.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


none


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: see above

EVENTS:


There are clinical /electrographic events captured during this study, despite the breach artifact.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of  66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Focal seizures discernable even with artifacts



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of ongoing seizures.  Plan discussed with house officer on call.
