HISTORY:

36 y.o. MAN P/W HX OF SZ SINCE 2008. PT STATES LAST SZ WAS LAST
MONTH. PT STATES HE ALSO HAS POOR MEMORY.



PMH : ASTHMA



MEDICATIONS:

oxcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL)

topiramate (TOPAMAX)



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Excess diffuse 5-7Hz frequency discharges in wakefulness. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-
25Hz activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



1. Excess theta in wakefulness

2. Excess beta




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing.  These
finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
