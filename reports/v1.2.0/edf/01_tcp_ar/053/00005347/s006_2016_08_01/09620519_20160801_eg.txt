HISTORY:

This is a 36 y.o. right handed male admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: refractory epilepsy.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Characterization of seizures, presurgical evaluation.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patient's exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded
referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive.  Periods of interest
were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.




MEDICATIONS:

Topamax 200 mg q12h


Oxcarbazepine 1200 mg q12h


SEDATION: None



DAY 1 (8/1/2016, 11:00 - 8/2/2016, 06:00)



AEDs:

Topamax 200 mg q12h

Oxcarbazepine 1200 mg AM, 900 mg PM



BACKGROUND:




The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of
alpha with admixed beta. There is excess theta in wakefulness.



Posterior dominant rhythm was present at 9 Hz.



There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was characterized by symmetric sleep spindles and/or K-complexes.


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:


1. Mild excess of theta in wakefulness


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

DAY 2 (8/2/2016, 06:00 - 8/3/2016, 06:00)



AEDs:

Topamax 200 mg q12h


Oxcarbazepine 900 mg AM, 450 mg PM


INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: unchanged



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:



Rare (<1hour) right frontal sharp transients in sleep, not clearly epileptiform



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


SEIZURES/EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in 60s



-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 3 (8/3/2016, 06:00 - 8/4/2016, 06:00)


AEDs:

Topamax 200 mg q12h


Oxcarbazepine 1200 mg AM, 1200 mg PM



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: Excess theta in wakefulness. Occasionally there is polymorphic slowing
over the left temporal region.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


SEIZURES/EVENTS:

AEDs:

Topamax 200 mg q12h


Oxcarbazepine 900 mg AM, 450 mg PM


INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: unchanged



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:






INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were significant for excess of theta in
wakefulness; over the course of the study this theta slowing seemed more predominant on the left
occasionally.  There were no epileptiform discharges.





ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Unable to determine



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Unable to determine



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG.
This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of seizures with presurgical
evaluation.




The interictal EEG is characterized by excess of theta in wakefulness; over the course of the study this
theta slowing seemed more predominant on the left occasionally. These findings are indicative of
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, with subtle left temporal dysfunction.  There were no epileptiform
discharges.




The patient initially agreed to wean down his Trileptal to capture events. However, by day 3 he
stated he was anxious to leave, so a full wean was unable to be completed.  His Trileptal was
restarted at full dose on this day and he was watched for 1 more day. No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.  None of his habitual events were captured.




Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
