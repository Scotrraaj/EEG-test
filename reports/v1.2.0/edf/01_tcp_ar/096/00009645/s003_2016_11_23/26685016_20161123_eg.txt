HISTORY: 48 y.o. MAN WITH CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS.   PMH: SZ 2012,HTN  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: potassium, sodium phosphates (PHOS-NAK) packet 1 packet phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB aspirin EC tablet 81 mg folic acid (FOLVITE) tablet 1 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg tamsulosin (FLOMAX) 24 hr capsule 0.4 mg heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg mirtazapine (REMERON) tablet 7.5 mg pyridoxine (vitamin B6) (B-6) tablet 50 mg amylase-lipase-protease (CREON) 6,000-19,000 -30,000 unit per capsule 1 capsule amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg carvedilol (COREG) tablet 6.25 mg lactulose (CHRONULAC) solution 20 g   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/23/2016, 19:16- 11/24/2016, 08:00) BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of diffuse ~9-10 Hz activity admixed with under riding fast activity.  The AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient is poor.  Sleep is captured overnight with sleep spindles noted.  There is continuous polymorphic delta activity and attenuation of faster frequencies over the left anterior temporal region.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Continuous ~0.5-2 Hz moderate to high amplitude periodic epileptiform discharges are captured over the left anterior temporal region (F7/T1 maximal).  These appear to increase in frequency at times and become very rhythmic but never fully evolve or reach 3 Hz.   OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of ~90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal prolonged continuous EEG due to: 1. Mild diffuse slowing and disorganization 2. Continuous left anterior temporal focal slowing 3. Continuous quasi-periodic 0.5-2 Hz left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges. 4. No clear electrographic seizures  CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a potentially epileptogenic cortical structural abnormality over the left anterior temporal region. Diffuse slowing and disorganization are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  -----------------------------------------------------------------   DAY 2 (11/24/2016 - 11/25/2016)  BACKGROUND: No change   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Continuous quasi-rhythmic high amplitude left anterior temporal sharp waves, that occasionally throughout the recording appear in brief non-evolving runs at a repetition rate of up to 2 Hz.  Additionally, occasional brief (2-3 sec in duration) nonevolving 4-5 Hz left temporal predominant BIRDs (Brief Ictal/Interictal Rhythmic/Repetitive Discharges) are captured.   EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a regular heart rate.  DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term 24 hour video EEG due to: Ongoing quasi-periodic left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges and occasional left temporal BIRDs (Brief Ictal/Interictal Rhythmic/Repetitive Discharges)  These findings indicate a potentially epileptogenic focal structural cerebral abnormality emanating from the left anterior temporal region.  No electrographic seizures are captured.  -----------------------------------------------------------------    DAY 3 (11/25/2016 - 11/26/2016)  BACKGROUND: No change   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Left anterior temporal quasi periodic epileptiform discharges continue. They appear to be less frequent and they organize into brief rhythmic runs much less frequently.   EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a regular heart rate.  DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term 24 hour video EEG due to: Ongoing quasi-periodic left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges and occasional left temporal BIRDs (Brief Ictal/Interictal Rhythmic/Repetitive Discharges)  These findings indicate a potentially epileptogenic focal structural cerebral abnormality emanating from the left anterior temporal region.  No electrographic seizures are captured.   -----------------------------------------------------------------   DAY 4 (11/26/2016, 08:00- 11/27/2016, 08:00) BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of a 9-10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).  The AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient has improved.  Normal sleep is captured overnight with sleep spindles noted.  There is continuous polymorphic delta activity and attenuation of faster frequencies over the left anterior temporal region.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Continuous ~0.5-1 Hz moderate to high amplitude periodic epileptiform discharges are captured over the left anterior temporal region (F7/T1 maximal).  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of ~90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  DAY 4 IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal prolonged 24 hour EEG due to: 1. Continuous left anterior temporal focal slowing 2. Continuous quasi-periodic 0.5-1 Hz left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a potentially epileptogenic cortical structural abnormality over the left anterior temporal region. No seizures were seen.
