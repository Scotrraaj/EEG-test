SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Fragments of a
symmetric posterior dominant rhythm are likely present, but interpretation is limited by near constant
eye movement artifact during wakefulness, including nystagmus artifact.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.





OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


1. A single left occipital sharply contoured theta wave is noted in drowsiness, not clearly epileptiform



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal, albeit limited (near constant eye movement artifact during wakefulness), awake and
drowsy routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal, though limited, awake and drowsy routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

If clinically warranted, a recording with stage II sleep may be helpful.
