HISTORY: This is a 23 y.o. female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.     Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.  Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons: - The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate. - Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus; - The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;   - The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient’s exam There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service  CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.   Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24 hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.    The spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.    MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg divalproex (DEPAKOTE DR) tablet 500 mg divalproex (DEPAKOTE DR) tablet 1,000 mg risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) tablet 0.25 mg cloNIDine (CATAPRES) tablet 0.2 mg clonazePAM (KLONOPIN) tablet 0.5 mg FLU vaccine qs 2016-17 (36 mos+)(PF) injection 0.5 mL pneumococcal 23-val ps vaccine (PNEUMOVAX) injection 0.5 mL ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) capsule 50,000 Units lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) tablet 150 mg  SEDATION: None  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 1 (11/07/2016, -11/08/2016)  AEDs:  Lamictal and Depakote  INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of alpha with admixed beta.

She is put back to bed. At 17:30, she begins crying again and again mother pushes event button. Mother hands her a tissue, patient wipes nose with right hand.

Nonepileptic behavioral events  EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:  1. Nonepileptic behavioral events  CONCLUSION:  was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 7 days with continuous video EEG.  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization/differential diagnosis. Two episodes of crying/mild agitation with reported dizziness were captured.  The second episode occurred after the dose of Lamictal was lowered slightly, and included feeling hot.  The patient's mother confirmed that this latter episode represented the episodes the patient was having at home.  Neither of these episodes had an ictal cerebral correlate.  The patient's Lamictal was increased to the dose she had been taking at home. Her Depakote dosing was not changed.  Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
