HISTORY:

22 y.o. female with a history of learning disability, refractory seizures
characterized by screaming referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

medroxyPROGESTERone (DEPO-PROVERA) 150 mg/mL injection, Inject 150 mg into the muscle
every 3 months.


lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 25 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. As part of the dose
of 100 mg in am and 150 mg in pm


clonazePAM (KLONOPIN) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily as needed for Anxiety.

risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) 0.25 mg tablet, Take 0.25 mg by mouth daily.


cloNIDine (CATAPRES) 0.2 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY EVENING.

divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 500 mg EC tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY MORNING AND
TAKE 2 TABLETS EVERY EVENING


TECHNIQUE:



A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Generous beta was noted in the background.  In some
sections of the background there is 16 Hz beta noted in wakefulness.



Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This  awake routine EEG is remarkable for:


1. Excess beta


CLINICAL CORRELATION:






The excess beta can be due to anxiety or this patient's clinical syndrome or medications.  This
routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
