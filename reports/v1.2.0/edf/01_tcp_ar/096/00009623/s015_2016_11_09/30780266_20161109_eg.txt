HISTORY:

65 y.o. male with a history of L MCA infarct presenting with seizure, referred for
routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % with KCl 20 mEq/L infusion


docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg

senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


aspirin EC EC tablet 325 mg

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

lacosamide (VIMPAT) 200 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg







SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record
due to abundant muscle artifact as well as chewing artifact and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.


Frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:




This is an abnormal, limited, awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of the presence of a left temporal dysfunction,
structural or physiologic in origin.
