HISTORY:  A 68-year-old woman, admitted with known cardiac


pathology, admitted to the medicine service for chest pain.

Subsequently earlier today patient had abrupt right-sided

weakness with head deviation and neglect.  Initial imaging was


unrevealing for acute stroke and then patient became more

globally confused.  Found to have Acute infarct in the posterior

limb of the left internal capsule.




MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.




INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at

bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1

channel EKG.  This is a technically challenging record in a


patient who was poorly interactive with significant muscle

artifact.




DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background initially has low

voltage with generous beta and a glimpse of an 11 Hz alpha rhythm

and some central alpha and beta frequency activity.  There are


isolated bursts of slowing with lower voltage delta noted in the




background.  At the very end of the record, the patient seems to

be becoming more drowsy with a decrease in muscle and an increase


in slowing.




Heart rate 60 bpm.



IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:

1. Excess beta.


2. Intermittent isolated bursts of delta.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal features could be identified in

this record.  There were no epileptiform features seen.  Overall,

this EEG is more supportive of a global disturbance of cerebral

function.
