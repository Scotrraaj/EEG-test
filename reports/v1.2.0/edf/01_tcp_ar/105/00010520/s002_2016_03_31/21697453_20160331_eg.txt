No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKGand

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by a low voltage pattern


but the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha

and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10.5 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior

gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Alpha squeak


phenomenon was noted.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.  The patient is excessively drowsy

throughout much of the EEG.  In drowsiness, there are full bursts


of shifting slowing left greater than right



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with few

symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles . Slow wave sleep was not

captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

Scant focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:




Photic Stimulation: Elicits a vigorous driving response with

subharmonic and supra harmonic driving



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. rare bursts of shifting slowing in drowsiness, greater than

expected for an adult of this age



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is the second EEG for this adult without epileptiform

features.  Like the first EEG, the patient did seem to be


excessively drowsy the focal features described above are

nonspecific and can be seen in the context of undergoing ischemic


cerebrovascular disease or epilepsy
