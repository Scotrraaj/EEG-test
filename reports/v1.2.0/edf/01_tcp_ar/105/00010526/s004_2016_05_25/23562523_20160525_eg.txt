DATE OF STUDY: 05/25/16 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep    HISTORY: a 46 y.o. female with a history of seizures, now presents with 3 seizures.    MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin Ativan  SEDATION: Ativan  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  EEG BACKGROUND: During brief arousals the background consists of low-to-moderate amplitude 10 Hz polymorphic alpha activity and poor AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient.  There is prominent diffuse excess beta activity.  Patient rapidly transitions to drowsiness and sleep.  Normal sleep architecture, including vertex waves and sleep spindles is seen.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.       Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.       Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.   EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of ~104 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to: 1. Mild background disorganization  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but in this patient, could be related to excessive drowsiness and/or medication effect.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
