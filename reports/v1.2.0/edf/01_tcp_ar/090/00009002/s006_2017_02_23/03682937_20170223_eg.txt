HISTORY:

This is a 56 y.o. right handed male admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: refractory epilepsy. In addition to TC seizures, he has spells of shaking
and tremor/shiver. Most recent event is unclear. Patient varies in reporting of 1-2 per month vs none
in the last two months.





Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Medication adjustment.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.









- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

DAY 1 (2/23/2017, 11:00)



BACKGROUND:



The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized but clearly asymmetric
mixture of theta, alpha and beta frequencies, with a  reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR)on the left. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present on
the left, not as well defined on the right.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.

Sleep is characterized by synchronous and symmetric sleep transients, including vertex waves, sleep
spindles, and K complexes. Slow wave sleep is not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.


Right hemispheric focal slowing is present, with disruption of faster frequency activity in the right
hemisphere and theta frequency activity in the right occipital region.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.



EKG: A single lead captured 84 BPM


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


R hemisphere focal slowing, posterior max, intermittent.

Paucity of R alpha rhythm

No spikes

DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



Focal slowing, congruent with stroke history.

No epileptiform activity




Overall impression and clinical correlation:

No epileptiform discharges.

Focal features are posterior to region of infarct seen on MRI of brain.

Attempts to increase activity were limited (PT involved) given hemiparesis- can't HV well or bike.


No events could be captured. Given the fragile nature of the patient, LEV dose was returned to a
therapeutic dose as we wanted to avoid a convulsion.


Baclofen was added to reduce spasticity.
