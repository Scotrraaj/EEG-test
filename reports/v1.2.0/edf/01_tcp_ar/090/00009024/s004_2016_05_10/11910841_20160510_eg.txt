HISTORY:

38 y.o. male with a history of probable refractory localization related epilepsy
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures and presurgical evaluation.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 200 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.


aspirin (BAYER) 325 mg Tablet tablet, Take 325 mg by mouth daily.

hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth daily.

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth 2 times daily.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:





A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
theta and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.


Mild generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing.

2. Bradycardia noted on a single EKG lead





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

Bradycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.


Following this study the patient was continued on EEG monitoring in the EMU.
