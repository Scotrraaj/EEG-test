HISTORY:

38 y.o. MALE P/W WITH A HX OF SZ SINCE

2011. LAST SZ WAS LAST NIGHT. +GENERALIZED SHAKING, + TOUNGE


BITE, - INCONT. UNKOWN DURATION.


PMH: HTN, SLEEP APNEA



MEDICATIONS:

TOPIRAMATE, METOPROLOL, KEPPRA



SEDATION:  None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of an


organized symmetric mixture of theta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 7.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal 1 Hr awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild diffuse slowing in wakefulness


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of mild diffuse cerebral

dysfunction which is non-specific with regards to etiology.
