RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient

EEG TYPE: long term monitoring





HISTORY:


a 59 y.o. male who presented with 4

generalized convulsions without returning to his functional

baseline.



MEDICATIONS:

Ativan 4 mg in ED, Depakote, Zonisamide



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG.






BACKGROUND:

Patient is asleep throughout most of the recording.  Early in the

recording, sleep is characterized by a mixture of delta and beta

activity.  As the recording progresses, symmetrical vertex waves


appear.



During very brief arousals, the background consists of fragmented

8-9 Hz activity, poor AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient, and

excess of polymorphic theta and delta activity.



Subtle paucity of faster frequencies is noted over the right.





PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single lead captured regular heart rate




IMPRESSION:

- diffuse slowin - mild-to-moderate

- focal slowing - subtle - right hemispheric



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal ~ 16 hour continuous video EEG due to

Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild-to-moderate diffuse


cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but, in

this case, at least partially related to the medication effect.


Subtle focal right hemispheric slowing is indicative of a focal

structural lesion in this region and could also be post-ictal


finding.
