History:	41 year old woman with a history of seizures since the age of 22 yo.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The awake background consists of diffuse moderate amplitude excess beta activity.  During 
drowsiness, voltages attenuate and bursts of RMTD (rhythmic midtemporal theta activity of 
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.  
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at 
multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
	Beta, excessive
	No epileptiform discharges
	No stage 2 sleep
	RMTD (rhythmic midtemporal theta activity of drowsiness)
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG. No epileptiform discharges are present, but 
stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may 
provide additional information.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication 
effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60
