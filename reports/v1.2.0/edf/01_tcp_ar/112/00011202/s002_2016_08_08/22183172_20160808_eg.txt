SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse
theta/delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. At
times a  Marked intermixed diffuse beta is seen.




Sleep is not captured



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the anterior
temporal region with associated loss of faster frequencies over that region.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):




None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Continuous focal slow waves and attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere
maximal in the anterior temporal region.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the right
hemisphere maximal in the anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal
cerebral dysfunction in this region, consistent with the known SDH. In addition there is evidence of
diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
