History:	58 year old woman with a history of right sided tumor removed ~10 years ago.  
	Patient reports a single seizure some years ago.
Medications:	GABAPENTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The background consists of a moderate amplitude polymorphic 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates 
with eye opening.  The AP gradient is weak.  Diffuse excess beta activity is seen.  During 
drowsiness, voltages increase, theta activity appears and occasional symmetrical vertex waves are 
  No clear epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good 
cooperation, and produces no effect.
Summary of Findings:
	Disorganization, mild
	No epileptiform discharges
	Beta, excessive
	No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG due to mild background disorganization. 
These findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or 
barbiturates.
