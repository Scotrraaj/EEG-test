HISTORY:

44 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy, non compliance,presented with repetitive
seizures, followed by obtundation and possible R MCA CVA  referred for routine EEG for screening
for subclinical seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

Prior : PHT/Ativan

BP (!) 129/92  Pulse 88  Temp 97.1 F (36.2 C) (Rectal)  Resp 18  SpO2 98%


TECHNIQUE:

A STAT portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and  Stimulation.  This was a
challenging study in an intermittently uncooperative patient.




EEG BACKGROUND:




The  background is characterized by the presence of a  generalized slow pattern, with shifting
slowing. There are arousals, with alpha/theta pattern, and then shifting slowing.


Intermittent R/L  focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: stimulation of the patient produces faster frequency activity


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  STAT portable  EEG due to:

1. Slowing, shifting slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings can be seen in a diffuse disorder of cerebral function.  No seizures were recorded.
LTM will follow, which may more precisely delineate the background EEG
