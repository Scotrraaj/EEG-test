SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.



There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms and voltage attenuation over
right.



The background over the left consists of 1 Hz diffuse frontally predominant sharp waves of triphasic
morphology that evolve into diffuse fast activity.  These runs last ~ 1 minute and are present
continuously throughout the recording.  There is no clear clinical correlate, however, the technologist
does note that patient has some bilateral eye twitching.  Video review of that segment is limited
since only the left side of patient's face is visible.  He has subtle eye blinking that is not rhythmic.





Similar activity is present over the right, but it is much more attenuated.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.





Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.






HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to:

Suspected left hemispheric status epilepticus.



These findings were conveyed to the primary team and patient was placed on continuous video EEG
monitoring.






CLINICAL CORRELATION:
