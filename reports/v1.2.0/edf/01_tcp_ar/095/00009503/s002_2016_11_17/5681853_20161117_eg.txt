HISTORY:

64 y.o. female with a history of generalized seizures, on lifelong antiepileptic drug
therapy with infrequent epilepsy care referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

UNKNOWN TO PATIENT, Patient states she is on a blood pressure medication

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) 30 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 12 hours.


phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. The record is slightly disorganized and there is scant
posterior slowing.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained

Scant generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a mildly abnormal routine EEG:


1. Mildly disorganized pattern.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are similar to the 2014 EEG. Of note, that study identified one left temporal sharp
and some left focal slowing

This routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
