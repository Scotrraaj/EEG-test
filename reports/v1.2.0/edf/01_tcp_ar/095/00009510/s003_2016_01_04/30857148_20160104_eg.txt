HISTORY:

70 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy

referred for routine EEG for confusional spells which were not


identical to previously describe seizures.  Patient had mixed up

medications and forgot to take one of her 2 seizure medicines

1) While awake, staring ahead with some head automatisms,


postictally she wanders around and does not follow commands,

aphasic throughout




2) Out of sleep, she makes grunting noises, phasic at times with

secondary generalization




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

Calcium Carbonate-Vitamin D3 (CALCIUM 600 WITH VITAMIN D3) 600


mg(1,500mg) -400 unit Tablet, Chewable, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2




times daily.

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 3 tablets by mouth 2


times daily. Three tablets bid

carBAMazepine (CARBATROL) 200 mg 12 hr capsule, TAKE 2 CAPSULES


BY MOUTH TWICE DAILY

BAYER ASPIRIN PO, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.

amlodipine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.




SEDATION: none




TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG*and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.



Early in drowsiness there are isolated bursts of irregular

slowing noted in either temporal region which made occur


independently.  Other features of drowsiness included bursts of

rhythmic frontal delta..






Stage II sleep was not achieved






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic


stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce

any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is a mildly abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG FOR AN


ADULT OF THIS AGE :

1. shifting slowing noted in drowsiness

2. a more disorganized pattern than one might expect in early

drowsiness for subjective this age


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is the second EEG for this adult without epileptiform


activity.  The intermittent slowing noted in the background may

be correlated with the clinical history for this adult with more

than 20 years history of epilepsy and, by report, cognitive

impairment


This routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
