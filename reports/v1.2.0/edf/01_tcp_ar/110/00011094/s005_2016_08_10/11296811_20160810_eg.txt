SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). Low amplitude frontocentral beta activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Stage II sleep is marked by increased irregular generalized slowing and central temporal sleep
spindles. Spindle activity is higher in amplitude on the left.



Throughout the tracing, a large amount of irregular medium voltage 3-4 Hz activity is seen over left
frontocentral regions. Occasional runs of sharply contoured left frontotemporal 7-8 Hz activity is seen,
likely representing a breach rhythm.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:




Occasional (1/hour to <1min) sharp waves are seen in the left frontocentral region, maximum at F3.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Irregular left frontocentral slowing.

2. Occasional sharp transients in the left anterior frontocentral region, maximum at F3.


3. Probable breach rhythm with occasional runs of sharply contoured medium amplitude 7-8 Hz
activity and higher amplitude left temporal spindle activity during stage II sleep.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate a functional abnormality in the left frontocentral region with mild irritative
features (occasional sharp activity). If the patient has a clinical history of seizures, the above
abnormalities would be suggestive of a potential epileptogenic region in the left frontocentral area.
