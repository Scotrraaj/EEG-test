History:	49 year old woman with a recurrent left frontal meningioma and recurrent seizures.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, 
	drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal 
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric 
Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the left central region during wakefulness, 
increasing during drowsiness and sleep. There is an associated increased voltage and faster 
frequencies in the region consistent with a breach rhythm.  At times this activity is sharply 
countoured.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse 
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does 
not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, left central
	Breach artifact, left central
	Sleep, stage 2
	No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 41-minute awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal 
slowing in the left central region, which is consistent with the known prior surgery in the same 
region.  Breach artifact indicates a skull defect.
