DATE OF STUDY: 04/25/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient






HISTORY:

a 49 y.o. 49 YR WOMAN 3/16--PMHX RESECTION LEFT FOR BRAIN MASS
WITH SUBSEQUENT SZS.  PT CC OF SLURRED SPEECH AND LLE WEAKNESS. IN ED HAD SZ.
GIVEN ATIVAN

4/25 P/W NUMBNESS IN HANDS.


MEDICATIONS:


KEPPRA, DEPAKOTE


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the F3/C3 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness. There are associated faster frequencies seen over this region.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Continuous left frontal focal slow waves and breach rhythm



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the left frontal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in this region consistent with
the  known tumor and surgery.
