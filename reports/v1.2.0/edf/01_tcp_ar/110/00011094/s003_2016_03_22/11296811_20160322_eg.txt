HISTORY:

49 y.o. female with a history of left brain

tumor s/p resection with subsequent seizures, who presents with


slurred speech left leg weakness, and seizure in the ER; now

referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures. S/p

Ativan in ED



MEDICATIONS: DEXAMETHASONE, ATIVAN, KEPPRA, LOVENOX, DIOVAN,

AMLODIPINE, INSULIN



SEDATION: as above



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically




satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

There is continuous subtle left central slowing at times

extending to the left temporal region, accentuated by drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Continuous subtle left central slowing at times extending to


the left temporal region


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of left central > temporal


cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.
