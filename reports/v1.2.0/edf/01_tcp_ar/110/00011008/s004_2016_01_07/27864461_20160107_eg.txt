HISTORY:

78 y.o. male with a history of prior CVA,

Epilepsy referred for continuous video EEG monitoring to exclude


subclinical

seizures. The patient had a seizure prior to admission and was

unresponsive.

TECHNIQUE:

Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside in  ICU

with 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)

was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. the


patient had a recent episode of bradycardia to 30 bpm.  Seizure

and spike detection software was utilized.  The patient was

intubated and poorly responsive



EEG BACKGROUND: The recording began to 3:40 AM. At that time,

the pattern demonstrates a continuous,


mixed frequency pattern rich in faster frequency activity in the

frontal regions. In the right posterior quadrant, there is

disruption in faster frequency activity and there is a lower

voltage more arrhythmic pattern.


The morning progresses, the record is increasingly rich in faster

frequency activity particularly in the frontal regions with


frontal 12 Hz activity.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Ocassional frontal delta


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Stimulation of the patient produces an

increase in faster frequency activity particularly from the left



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal, staph, bedside portable EEG:

#1: Initially suppressed background

#2: Rapid transition into low voltage and then medium voltage


continuous pattern

#3 right posterior focal slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:This dynamic pattern demonstrates a clear

improvement, following treatment patient's apnea and bradycardia.

No seizures were recorded. No epileptiform features were noted

This EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
