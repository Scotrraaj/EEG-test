HISTORY:

78 y.o. male with a history of HTN, afib,

COPD, dementia, EtOH abuse, adrenal insufficiency, and R MCA


infarct who was found having a seizure by his family. EEG

requested as a follow up study. Tech notes that prior to EEG

being connected, patient coded, CPR was performed with ROSC.



MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Ativan



SEDATION: meds as above


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous, symmetric, but not clearly reactive

to noxious stimulation. Cerebral rhythms consist of a


disorganized mixture of delta and theta with admixed alpha, the

latter primarily seen anteriorly.


State change is not captured.



Severe generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


An irregular heart rate captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing and background disorganization,

with no clear reactivity to noxious stimulation


2. An irregular heart rate captured on a single EKG lead.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral


dysfunction.

The current study demonstrates similar background to that seen


towards the latter end of the long term EEG study on 1/7/2016,

with the exception that right posterior focal slowing is not


clearly seen on the current study.

An irregular heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead.
