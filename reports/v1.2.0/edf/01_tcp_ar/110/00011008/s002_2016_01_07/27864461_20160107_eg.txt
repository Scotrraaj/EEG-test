HISTORY:

78 y.o. male with a history of prior CVA,

Epilepsy referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical


seizures.  The patient had a seizure prior to admission and was

unresponsive.

times daily.

daily as needed for Anxiety.

ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet, Take 1 tablet by

mouth 2 times daily.


The patient received phenytoin prior to this EEG



TECHNIQUE:


Stat portable bedside ICU 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)

was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. the

patient had a recent episode of bradycardia to 30 bpm



EEG BACKGROUND: The recording began to 3:19 AM.  At that time,

the pattern of low voltage featureless with full periodic delta


and  An irregular, slow heart rate of 40 bpm.  The record rapidly

transitions to a reacher, medium-low amplitude mixed delta theta

pattern at 3:21. At 3:25 AM the EEG demonstrates a continuous,

mixed frequency pattern Rich in faster frequency activity in the


frontal regions.  In the right posterior quadrant, there is

disruption in faster frequency activity and there is a lower


voltage more arrhythmic pattern.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal, staph, bedside portable EEG:

#1: Initially suppressed background


#2: Rapid transition into low voltage and then medium voltage

continuous pattern


#3 right posterior focal slowing

CLINICAL CORRELATION:This dynamic pattern demonstrates a clear

improvement, following treatment patient's apnea and bradycardia.

No seizures were recorded.  No epileptiform features were noted


This  EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
