HISTORY:

56 y.o. male with a history of seizures referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, TAKE ONE TABLET DAILY


simvastatin (ZOCOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.

meloxicam (MOBIC) 15 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


PEG 3350-electrolytes (GOLYTELY) 236-22.74-6.74 gram Recon Soln, DRINK 3 LITERS, then 12
hours later drink 1 liter.Start the last liter 5 hrs before procedure start.




citalopram (CELEXA) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.




TECHNIQUE:


A 1 hour   Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. POSTS are noted. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: does not activate the record



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.






HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a 1 hour normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic
events or abnormalities  reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
