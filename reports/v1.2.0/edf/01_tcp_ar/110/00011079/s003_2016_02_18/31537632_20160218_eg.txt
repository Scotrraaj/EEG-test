History:	28 year old woman with seizures.
Medications:	lamictal and topamax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal 
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric 
No focal slowing is present.  A single right frontotemporal (F8/F4 maximal) sharp wave with 
aftergoing slow wave is captured during sleep.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.  
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
	Sharp waves, one, right frontotemporal
	Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to a single right frontotemporal 
epileptiform discharges. This finding is suggestive of a potential epileptogenic focus over the right 
frontotemporal region.
