History:	72 year old woman with episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Depakote
Sedation:SS

EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, lethargic
Description:
During maximal arousal the posterior dominant rhythm consists of low-to-moderate amplitude 9 Hz 
alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, 
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Symmetrical sleep spindles and vertex waves are captured.
Continuous polymorphic sharply contoured theta and delta activity and underriding faster 
frequencies are noted over the right centroparietal region.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right, centroparietal
	Breach artifact, right, centroparietal
	Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable 21-minuite EEG due to continuous focal 
moderate focal slowing over the right centroparietal region. This finding is indicative of a focal 
structural lesion in this region.  Breach artifact is a result of a skull defect.  The lack of epileptiform 
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
