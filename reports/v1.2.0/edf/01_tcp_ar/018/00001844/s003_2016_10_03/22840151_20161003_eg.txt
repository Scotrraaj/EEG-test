No current facility-administered medications for this visit.


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to frequent movement and T6-T4 short distance and included a single channel of EKG and photic
stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized diffuse alpha/theta
frequencies, with no clear PDR.  There is no clear consistent anterior-to-posterior gradient of
frequency but a frontal alpha is seen at times more prominent on the right.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Generalized slow and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal limited awake and drowsy routine EEG due to moderate diffuse background
slowing and disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
