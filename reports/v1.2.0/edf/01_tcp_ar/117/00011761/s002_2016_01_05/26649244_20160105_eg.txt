HISTORY:

25 y.o. female with a history of seizures

referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events: she


is kicking her legs.



MEDICATIONS: propofol and midazolam




SEDATION: as above




TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

suboptimally organized diffuse beta activity, with admixed delta


frequencies. There is no definite posterior dominant rhythm.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of mild diffuse cerebral

dysfunction. This may at least in part be due to a medication


effect.

Excess of beta activity is associated with medications such as


propofol and midazolam.
