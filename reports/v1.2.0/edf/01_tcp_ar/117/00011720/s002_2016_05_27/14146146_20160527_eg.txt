HISTORY:

64 y.o. male with a history of seizures, depression, HTN, CAD referred for routine
EEG after a fall with possible syncope.



MEDICATIONS:


HOME MEDS: METOPROLOL, CLONAZEPAM, LAMOTRIGINE, LISINOPRIL


SEDATION: None listed



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized mixture of alpha,
theta, and delta. There is shifting delta slowing across the hemispheres. There is no definite posterior
dominant rhythm. The patient answers questions but quickly falls asleep afterwards.




Drowsiness is characterized by further background slowing.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




Moderate generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Occasional left temporal sharp waves in runs < 1 second, consistent in appearance with a benign
variant (wicket waves)



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization in wakefulness



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

The left temporal sharp waves noted above are most consistent with wicket waves, a benign variant.
