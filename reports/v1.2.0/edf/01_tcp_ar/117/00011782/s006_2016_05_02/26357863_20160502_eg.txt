SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

Day 1 May 2-May 3, 2016

MEDICATIONS:

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 300 mg capsule, Take 300 mg by mouth 3 times daily.  Had been taking
3200 mg daily.


divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.

hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth daily.


haloperidol (HALDOL) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth 3 times daily.

benztropine (COGENTIN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth 3 times daily.

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.


chlorproMAZINE (THORAZINE) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth 3 times daily.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.






Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  The family was
interviewed.  Some of their concerns were slurred speech which was not a paroxysmal finding but an
ongoing every day symptom.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 92 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal day 1 24 hour  routine EMU EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal video LTM routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Mild Sleep deprivation was utilized.  No events occurred.
Hyperventilation was deferred because of the patient's pulmonary disease.



EVENTS:

7:23 PM LEG AND SHOULDER MVNT, PT SAYS HEAD FEELS FUZZY.  The EEG at this time
demonstrates a normal awake pattern.  The patient is able to follow commands.


The family reports that the patient is more alert and interactive with medication reduction.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 92 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION::

This is a normal  Day 2 EMU  EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.

Day  3 May 4-May 5, 2016

EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



There are some slightly asymmetric EOMS.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep includes vertex waves and spindles. There are EOMS in sleep.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Sleep deprivation was utilized.  No events occurred.  Hyperventilation
was deferred because of the patient's pulmonary disease.



EVENTS:


NONE

HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 88 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION::

This is a normal  Day 3 EMU  EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:





INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings were insignificant with normal EEG with 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG  (3
days 95951).  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of symptoms.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  A normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of heradmission.No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



We recommend she continue to see a psychiatrist.  She and her wife are happy to do so.  With
careful review of the symptoms, the family feels that most of the symptoms have been due to
overmedication and that the patient was much improved by medication reduction.  Therefore,
neither patient nor family was eager to prolonged hospitalization or tried to elicit a nonepileptic
seizure.  The family was encouraged to speak up with practitioners to avoid overmedication.  The
patient demonstrated an understanding of the pre-existing diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures





Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
