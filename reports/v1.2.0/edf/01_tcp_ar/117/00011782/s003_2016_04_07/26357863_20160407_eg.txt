SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 12.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.



Diffuse excess beta activity is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

As single left midtemporal sharp wave with aftergoing slow wave

is captured (maximal over T3 lead).



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

Sharp wave - one - left midtemporal -T3 maximal


Beta - excess



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake adn drowsy 27-minute EEG due to a


single left midtemporal epileptiform discharge.

This finding is suggestive of an epileptogenic focus over the


left midtemporal region.

Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication

effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
