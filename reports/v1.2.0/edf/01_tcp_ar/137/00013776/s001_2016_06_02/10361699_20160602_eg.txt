This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.  EEG BACKGROUND: The background is characterized by diffuse low to medium amplitude beta. Occasional delta is seen.  Typical Sleep is not captured  Generalized slowing is present.    No focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. Tactile stimulation elicits stiffening.  EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal  ICU  routine EEG due to: 1.
