HISTORY: 54 y.o. male with a history of round unresponsive after alcohol consumption referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.  He was admitted with septic shock, ventilator dependent respiratory failure.  MEDICATIONS: Not provided SEDATION:  Not provided TECHNIQUE: A bedside portable monitor with 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and Tactile stimulation.  The patient is intubated and relatively somnolent.  This record was reviewed by the EEG physician on-call at the time of the recording.  The report was generated after some delay. DAY 1 (01/20/16- 1/21, 06:00)   BACKGROUND: The background is continuous, symmetric, consists primarily initially of a low-voltage beta pattern.  As the recording continues, there is a sleep pattern with a very low voltage slow background Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.  Spontaneous arousals were noted, again with a low-voltage pattern with generous beta and lower voltage frontocentral slowing The background is  reactive,  variable. There were  no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. Sleep was not well-defined  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected EKG: A single lead captured 107 BPM     DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Relatively low voltage, slow pattern, but reactive.  No epileptiform discharges.  No seizures were recorded ____________________________________ DAY 2 (01/21/16- 1/22, 06:00)   MEDICATIONS: Not provided SEDATION:  Not provided BACKGROUND: The  background is  continuous,  symmetric, consists primarily initially of a low-voltage beta pattern.  As the recording continues, there is a sleep pattern with a very low voltage slow background Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.  Spontaneous arousals were noted, again with a low-voltage pattern with generous beta and lower voltage frontocentral slowing, later on a frontal theta pattern is seen in wakefulness. The background is  reactive,  variable. There were  no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. Sleep was not well-defined  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None EVENTS:  Shaking spell 11:20 AM- this seems to be an arousal with eye opening, tremulousness with patient trembling from side to side and a low-voltage somewhat slow background. EKG: A single lead captured 110 BPM     DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Relatively low voltage, slow pattern, but reactive.  No epileptiform discharges.  No seizures were recorded.  The shaking spell identified by the team seems to be an arousal.  By the morning of the 22nd, patient is more consistently awake with a low voltage fast pattern, no real posterior dominant rhythm _____________________________________ DAY 3 (01/22/16- 1/23/2016, 06:00)   MEDICATIONS: Not provided SEDATION:  Versed 5 MD BACKGROUND: The  background is  continuous,  symmetric, consists primarily initially of a low-voltage slow pattern with some beta. Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.  Spontaneous arousals were noted, again with a low-voltage pattern with generous beta and lower voltage frontocentral slowing, later on a frontal theta pattern is seen in wakefulness. The background is reactive, Variable.  Tactile stimulation of the patient produces I have mean and a low-voltage beta pattern. There were  no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. Sleep was not well-defined  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None EVENTS:       3:50 AM  Versed given, but patient intubated, not responsive and no motor activity noted  EKG: A single lead captured 115 BPM     DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Relatively low voltage, slow pattern, but reactive.  No epileptiform discharges.  No seizures were recorded.   ______________________________________________________ Day 4, Jan 24, 2016 This data is not available for review  Impression and Clinical correlation: 3 days of continuous video EEG monitoring is available for review at this time.  No epileptiform features were identified.  This is a low-voltage, slow pattern, compatible with sepsis or severe metabolic encephalopathy.  Please note, at this time, the posted charge should be: 95951 x3
