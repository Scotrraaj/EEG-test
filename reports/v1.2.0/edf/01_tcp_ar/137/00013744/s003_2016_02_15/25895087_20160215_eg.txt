HISTORY: 77 y.o. MALE WITH RIGHT FACIAL TWITCHING.  PMHX: HTN, POST  HERPETIC NEUROLGIA, CAD STENT, HLD, CHF, FALL 2013 SAH, SDH,  MEDICATIONS: Depakote and Phenobarbital  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (2/15/2016, 09:55AM - 2/16/2016, 08:00AM)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of diffuse delta frequencies with an absence of a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). There is no normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.   Sleep was not captured.  Frequent focal slowing is seen over the left frontal region  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Frequent F3 sharp waves are seen during the record. At time these have a blunt morphology but appear to be periodic at 0.25 Hz consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges.   EVENTS: At 1:33PM there is a single seizure.  EEG: There is a crisp F3/C3 beta discharge that slows down in frequency and increases in amplitude as it evolves. The seizure spreads through the left hemisphere with minimal contralateral spread. It then continues to slow down in frequency to a delta frequency and suddenly stops. There is an associated rhythmic muscle artifact seen on the right hemisphere.   Clinical: On the video there is clear right facial twitching seen along with the electrical discharge.  EKG: A single lead captured 66 bpm  DAY 1 IMPRESSION  1. Single left frontal seizure 2. Left frontal sharps and focal slowing 3. Moderate to severe diffuse slowing.   CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to a single seizure arising from the left frontal region as well as sharp waves and focal slowing, which is indicative of an epileptogenic focus in that region. In addition there is moderate diffuse slowing. This is indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology.   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (2/16/2016, 08:00AM - 2/17/2016, 02:00PM)  BACKGROUND:  The waking background is characterized by the presence of diffuse delta frequencies with an absence of a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). There is no normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.   GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: Frequent focal slowing is seen over the left frontal region at times sharply contoured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Occasional left frontal sharp waves are seen.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured 72bpm   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION 1. Left frontal focal slowing 2. Moderate to severe diffuse slowing.  This is an abnormal EEG due to left frontal region sharp waves and focal slowing, which is indicative of an epileptogenic focus in that region. In addition there is moderate diffuse slowing. This is indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology.
