HISTORY:

77 y.o. Male WITH RIGHT FACIAL TWITCHING.

PMHX: HTN, POST  HERPETIC NEUROLGIA, CAD STENT, HLD, CHF, FALL


2013 SAH, SDH,


MEDICATIONS:


ATIVAN TOTAL 6 MG,  DEPAKOTE, KEPPRA


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of low


amplitude delta frequencies with an absence of a posterior

dominant rhythm (PDR). There is no normal anterior-to-posterior


gradient.


Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also

seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Intermittent left frontal (F3/C3) sharp waves are seen.



EVENTS:

There are 4 clinical seizures during the study.



Seizure: There is a crisp F3/C3 beta discharge that slows down in

frequency and increases in amplitude as it evolves. Polyspikes

can be seen and it only spreads throught the left hemisphere. It


then continues to slow down in frequency to a delta frequency and

suddenly stops. There is an associated rhythmic muscle artifact


at first only seen on the right hemisphere and seconds later

noted more diffusely. As the seizure ends the muscle artifact

settles again on the right. On the video there is clear right

facial twitching seen along with the electrical discharge.



The seizures lasted 42-52 seconds.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Four clinical seizures arising from the left fronto-central

region.

2. Severe diffuse slow

3. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal routine EEG due to four clinical seizures

arising from the left fronto-central region. This is indicative

of a focal epileptogenic focus in this region. In addition the

severe diffuse slowing is indicative of severe diffuse cerebral


dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology.

Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication


effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. These findings

were discussed with the primary team.
