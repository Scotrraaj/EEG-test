HISTORY:

47 y.o. right handed female with suspected focal epilepsy and headaches




Seizure typed

Very tired, feel hot, not right. Starts biting tongue. Not answering questions for 1 min and side to side
head shaking. She came out of it and reported she felt sleepy. No incontinence but did have to
urinate a lot afterwards. No frank muscle soreness after. Amnestic for event.




While sleeping, boyfriend noted hands/head started shaking, she was biting her tongue (the middle
of it). No frank soreness afterwards. Amnestic.

Can have bad headache 1-2 days after an episode.

· PHT 200 q12h

Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.


Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;



- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;

- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:


A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.




SEDATION: None




DAY 1 (09/30/2016, 11:09 - 10/1/2016, 08:00)

EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep stage I & II as well as deeper stages of sleep were seen.


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid to anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.


At times this is sharply contoured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Left anterior temporal wickets are noted.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


 Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and
produces no effect.



 Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving..




EVENTS:

None



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Intermittent focal slowing in the left mid and anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of
focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.

DAY 2 (10/01/2016, 08:00 - 10/02/2016, 08:00)



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep stage I & II as well as deeper stages of sleep were seen.


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid to anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.


At times this is sharply contoured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Left anterior temporal wickets are noted.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: None performed


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


EVENTS:







At 9:36PM the patient pushes the button and stick out her tongue while making twitching/mouth
movements movement of the face. The technician comes in minutes later and the patient does not
follow verbal commands. This behavior remains for about 10 minutes after which the patient slowly
starts answering questions.




The EEG during the episode reveals an normal background with a glossokinetic artifact.



DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Intermittent focal slowing in the left mid and anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of
focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.

DAY 3 (10/02/2016, 08:00 - 10/03/2016, 12:36)

DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:


Interictal Findings:

Intermittent focal slowing in the left mid and anterior temporal region



Ictal Findings:

The patient had one clinical event while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the
epilepsy monitoring unit.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Non-epileptic event



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 3 days with continuous video
EEG.  This was an diagnostic EMU monitoring session because of capturing her typical event.







The interictal EEG is characterized by Intermittent focal slowing in the left mid and anterior temporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.



The patient was weaned off Dilantin and Keppra over the course of her admission. She was started
on topiramate on the day prior to her discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes were
made during the hospitalization.




Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
