HISTORY:

47 y.o. female with a history of seizures. ? focal seizures. EMU addmission for
differential diagnosis.


Episode during baseline.



MEDICATIONS:

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.


Facility-Administered Medications Ordered in Other Visits:

aspirin EC tablet 81 mg

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg


calcitRIOL (ROCALTROL) capsule 0.5 mcg

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) tablet 800 mg

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 2,000 mg


levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 100 mcg

multivitamin (THERA) tablet 1 tablet



sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding. However the patient has a clinical event (see
below).




EVENTS:

During photic stimulation the patient starts twitching her mouth and her tongue protrudes out of her
mouth. She is tested with verbal and motor commands but she does not respond.





The EEG does not reveal a correlate with this behavior.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1. One event of mouth twitching and unresponsiveness with no EEG correlate.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG. The episode captured above had no EEG correlate
and as such is most consistent with a psychogenic non-epileptic event.
