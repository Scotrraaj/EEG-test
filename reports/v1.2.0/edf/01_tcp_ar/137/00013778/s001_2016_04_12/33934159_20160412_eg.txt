HISTORY:

61 y.o. male with a past history of

HTN, in the midst of a prolonged hospital course for 2nd and 3rd


degree burns, referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental

status change.



MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Versed


SEDATION: as noted above



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a somewhat

technically limited record due to frequent muscle artifact, and


included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous, symmetric, and variable, but poorly

organized. The majority of the record consists of disorganized


5-10 uV theta and delta. Occasionally there are very brief (<2

sec) periods of 20-50 uV disorganized theta.  Frequently the

background becomes obscured by diffuse muscle artifact,

predominantly affecting the temporal regions; these correlate


with biting movements on video.



There is no posterior dominant rhythm.

Sleep transients are not captured.


Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

An irregular heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal, somewhat limited, awake and drowsy  routine


EEG due to:

1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and background


disorganization

2. An irregular heart rate captured on a single EKG lead



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of the

presence of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

An irregular heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead.
