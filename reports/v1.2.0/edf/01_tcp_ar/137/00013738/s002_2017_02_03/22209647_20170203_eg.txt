HISTORY:

This is a 64 y.o. right handed male admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: refractory epilepsy.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Recording of seizures for presurgical evaluation.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION: None


DAY 1 (02/03/2017 - 2/04/2017)



BACKGROUND:



The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by synchronous and symmetric sleep transients, including vertex waves, sleep
spindles, and K complexes. Slow wave sleep and REM sleep are captured.



Subtle occasional polymorphic theta activity is seen over the right temporal region.



Diffuse excess beta activity is present.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.



EKG: A single lead captured a regular heart rate




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal ~ 18 hour continuous EEG due to:

- occasional mild right temporal focal slowing



This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly
structural in origin.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.

AEDs: Keppra decreased, Phenytoin 300 mg qHS and phenobarbital


INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

Subtle occasional polymorphic theta activity is seen over the right temporal region.



Diffuse excess beta activity is present.



Sleep architecture is normal.

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

SEIZURES/EVENTS:










A single event to which patient refers as " anxiety attack/ pseudoseizure"  Is captured.  It starts at ~
~3:35:40 pm.  Patient places his hand above the brown paper bag.  He later told me that she started
feeling perioral and bilateral hand numbness.  He then develops shortness of breath.  About 1 min
20 seconds later he gets frantic and attempts to breath rapidly in the paper bag.  He at first breaths
slowly in the bag but then starts hyperventilating at ~5 breaths per second.  Patient develops UEs
shaking at ~ 3:38:10 pm.  This shaking is characterized by rapid and forceful flexion and extension of
his arms that is not rhythmic and varies in amplitude.  There is no involvement of LEs.  Eyes remain
closed and there is some head bobbing.  By the end, there is only right arm shaking.  Patient is also
slumped in the bed.  Right arm shaking lessens in frequency and stops by ~ 3:39:55 PM.  Patient
does not respond immediately after the shaking stops.  Patient is able to squeeze the EEG






technologist's hand ~10 seconds after the event stops and opens his eyes when asked by the nurse
~15 seconds after the shaking stops.  He is able to state his name and recall the code word that was
given to him during the shaking.




Patient's heart rate is ~ 78 bpm prior to the episode and ~84 bpm after shaking stops.




Throughout the event, EEG only demonstrates movement and EMG artifact and remains at patient's
baseline.




EKG: A single lead captured a regular heart rate




DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Abnormal 24 hour study due to occasional mild right temporal focal slowing that remains without
change.

this event as his typical anxiety attack/ pseudoseizure.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:

Interictal Findings:



The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reaches 11 Hz.  Subtle occasional
polymorphic theta activity is seen over the right temporal region.  Diffuse excess beta activity is
present.  Sleep architecture is normal.




Ictal Findings:

The patient had 2 clinical events while undergoing continuous video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy
monitoring unit.  Events occurred on D#3 and day #5 of the recording.  The first event the patient
identified as his typical anxiety attack/ pseudoseizure and the second event as his typical seizure.
Neither of the events had any abnormal ictal correlate prior, during or after the event.  Both event
were non-epileptic events






SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1.  non-epileptic events




EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:


1.  non-epileptic events




CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 7 days with continuous video EEG.  The
patient had 2 clinical events while undergoing continuous video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy
monitoring unit.  Events occurred on D#3 and day #5 of the recording.  The first event the patient
identified as his typical anxiety attack/ pseudoseizure and the second event as his typical seizure.
Neither of the events had any abnormal ictal correlate prior, during or after the event.  Both events
were non-epileptic events.





Patient was informed of the diagnosis by the attending physician.  The diagnosis was
discussed extensively between the patient and the attending physician.  Unfortunately,
no family members or those who have witnessed patient's typical event in the outpatient setting were
available for the video review of the second event (identified  by the patient as his typical seizure).




The patient was weaned off Keppra, Dilantin and Phenobarbital over the course of the admission.
He was discharged to home on a phenobarbital taper with goal of weaning it off completely over the
next several weeks (with goal to avoid phenobarbital induced seizures).  The outpatient goal is for
the patient to be on no AEDs (anti-epileptic medications), since there is no evidence that patient has
epileptic seizures.
