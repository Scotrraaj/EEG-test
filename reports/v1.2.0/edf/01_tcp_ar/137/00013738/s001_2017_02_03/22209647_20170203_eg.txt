HISTORY:

64 y.o. male with a history of gunshot wound to the head in 1980 with refractory
seizures characterized by right arm and face numbness and facial twitching occurring every few days,
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


amitriptyline (ELAVIL) tablet 10 mg

lactulose (CHRONULAC) solution 10 g

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) tablet 97.5 mg


phenytoin (DILANTIN) ER capsule 300 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg


alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 1,000 mg





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of mildly disorganized 8-9 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR) and low amplitude anteriorly predominant beta activity. The patient was
variably restless, with moderate amounts of muscle artifact noted.




During drowsiness, attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm and diffuse background slowing are
seen.



Sleep is not captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 75 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild background disorganization and borderline slowing of dominant posterior rhythm during
wakefulness.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are nonspecific and indicate a mild bilateral cortical functional disturbance which can
be seen with a variety of mild encephalopathies of various etiologies. No persistent focal slowing, no
clinical or electrographic seizures and no pathologic paroxysmal epileptiform discharges were
recorded. The absence of epileptiform activity interictally cannot exclude the clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
