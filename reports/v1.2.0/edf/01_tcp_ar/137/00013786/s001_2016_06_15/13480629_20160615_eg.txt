SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

During very brief periods of wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8 Hz theta activity
with weak AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient.  Patient is unable to stay awake for even 1 minute
despite the EEG technologist's attempts.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.





EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate that rapidly cycles from ~ 60 bpm to ~104 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Mild diffuse slowing

2. Cardiac arrhythmia


3. Sleep stage II

4. No epileptiform discharges




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and mostly asleep routine EEG due to:


Mild diffuse slowing that is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific, but in this patient at least partially related to the excessive drowsiness.

The patient rapidly transitions from wakefulness to stage II sleep - please correlate with an underlying
sleep disorder.



A heart rate that rapidly cycles from ~ 60 bpm to ~104 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead- please
correlate clinicallly.
