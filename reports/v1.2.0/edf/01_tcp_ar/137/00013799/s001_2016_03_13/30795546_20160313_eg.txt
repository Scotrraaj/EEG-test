START DATE OF STUDY: 03/13/2016

END DATE OF STUDY: 03/14/2016



RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:

EEG TYPE: long term monitoring= 12 hours






HISTORY:

a 21 y.o. Male, found down, intubated on propofol, reportedly had tonic clonic
seizure in ED at Episcopal Hospital, referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS: unknown other than below

SEDATION: propofol



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with
T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and
included a single channel of EKG





DAY 1 (21:27pm 03/13/2016 - 03/14/2016, 11:00am)




BACKGROUND:

As the recording begins the patient is intubated in the ICU and unresponsive.


Initially the EEG demonstrates mixed frequency pattern with diffuse alpha and beta. By 12:30am the
patient has some intermittent eye movements. The patient is easily arousable by 9 am with light
stimulation with an awake pattern with generous beta and lambda waves. Patient is up and out of
bed by 10:40am, EEG still with prominent diffuse beta with lambda.




Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.



The background is reactive and variable.


There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



EVENTS: None



EKG: A single lead captured 80-90 bpm


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

1. Initially sedated with mixed frequency pattern rich with alpha and beta activity

2. At the end of the record the pattern in wakefulness is diffuse beta with lambda waves.



These findings are compatible with pharmacological sedation.
