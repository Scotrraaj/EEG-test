History:	82 year old woman undergoing pumonary thromboembolectomy.
	
	Incision: 8:39:20 AM
	Heparin: 9:01:39 AM
	Bypass: 9:12:17 AM
	Complete burst-suppression: ~10:08 AM
	Off Bypass: ~1 PM
Medications:	FENTANYL, ISOFLURANE, MIDAZOLAM, ETOMIDATE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, comatose
Description:
At the beginning of the recording, patient is awake and very tense. The background consists of low 
amplitude beta activity posteriorly and high amplitude overwhelming EMG artifact anteriorly.  At 
~7:44:30 AM the background changes and diffuse slow underrding delta activity appears.  Within ~ 
1 minute, the background changes further: EMG artifact disappears, periods of discontinuity appear 
and a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity  with underriding fast activity is seen.  As the 
recording progresses, there is gradual attenuation of the background amplitude and fast 
frequencies.  Total burst suppression is achieved at ~10:08 AM at ~15.8 degrees Celcius.  Rare 
bursts of EEG activity re-appear at ~ 11:05 AM and QRS complexes re-appear at ~ 11:35:38 AM.  
By ~11:37: 32 AM bursts of activity become longer and more frequent.  By the end of the recording,
 the background is continuous.  There is new focal polymorphic delta activity captured over the 
bilateral, left>right, anterior temporal regions.  The attending surgeon was notified of this EEG 
change during the monitoring.
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is a continuous intraoperative nearly 6 hour EEG with direct attending EEG supervision of ~4.5
 hours. New bilateral anterior temporal, left>right, focal slowing is seen by the end of the recording. 
 This change could correspond to the intraoperative ischemia to the bilateral anterior temporal 
regions.  The attending surgeon was notified of this EEG change during the monitoring.
