HISTORY:

55 y.o. female with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


DILANTIN EXTENDED 100 mg ER capsule, TAKE 1 CAPSULE BY MOUTH 4 TIMES A DAY -DO
NOT CRUSH OR CHEW

DILANTIN 30 mg ER capsule, TAKE 1 CAPSULE BY MOUTH TWICE A DAY -AVOID ALCOHOLIC
BEVERAGES

clonazePAM (KLONOPIN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily as needed.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: Klonopin



TECHNIQUE:



A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 12 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Diffuse excess beta activity is seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Recurrent 3-5 second runs of rhythmic non-evolving bilateral frontocentral 4-5 Hz activity are
captured during drowsiness.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is probably normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic
events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is probably normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.


Repetitive brief runs of rhythmic nonevolving bilateral 4-5 Hz activity seen during drowsiness is of
uncertain clinical significance.  A repeat more prolonged study with sleep could be benefit to better
delineate clinical significance of these runs.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
