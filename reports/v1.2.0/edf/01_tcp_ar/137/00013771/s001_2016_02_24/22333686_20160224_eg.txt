SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.


EEG BACKGROUND:

Patient moves frequently throughout the recording, she pulls on


EKG lead and EEG leads.  The background consists of 11-11.5 Hz

alpha posteriorly, but it is unstable.  There is AP gradient,


that too is unstable.


Frequent prolonged (up to 17 seconds) bursts of diffuse slow

rhythmic delta activity are present.  There is a suggestion of


decrease in heart rate during these bursts, but EKG lead is off

for more than half of the recording (due to poor patient


cooperation).


Nearly continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity are

captured over the right frontotemporal region. Additional


underriding faster frequencies are captured over the same region.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

An irregular heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead.  At


times HR is <60 bpm.



IMPRESSION:

Moderate nearly continuous focal slowing right frontotemporal

region

Prolonged diffuse delta runs


Breach - frontotemporal

Cardiac arrhythmia



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This EEG was stopped after ~ 9 minutes of the recording, since

patient refused to continue the recording.  EEG is awake only and


abnormal due to moderate nearly continuous focal slowing over the

right frontotemporal region and bursts of diffuse rhythmic


slowing.


The etiology of the latter finding is not clear, but suggestive

of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, possibly secondary to increased


ICP, bilateral deep white matter lesions, nonspecific

encephalopathy.



Focal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly


structural in etiology.



Breach effect is secondary to the skull defect.
