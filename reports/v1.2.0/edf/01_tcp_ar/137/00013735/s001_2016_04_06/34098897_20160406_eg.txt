HISTORY:

a 2 days  Full term female with a history of

referred for routine EEG for myoclonus.



MEDICATIONS:

Phenobarbital Ampicillin, Gentamycin. ACYCLOVIR



SEDATION: none



TECHNIQUE:

A  1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

tactile stimulation. Neonatal montage was used.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The background has the appropriate wave forms for a subject of


this age

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of theta and delta and some frontal delta, organized

appropriately for age.




Sleep is present, and includes a pattern with delta and theta.

Trace alternans is noted. Vertex waves were identified.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Rare (2) O1 sharp waves were noted

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile stimulation alerts the baby, and

eliminates the trace alternans pattern.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.

The myoclonic jerks were not captured.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 99-114 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal 1 hour neonatal  EEG.  There are no clinical or

electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal 1 hour EEG.  The appropriate developmental

milestones were seen.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
