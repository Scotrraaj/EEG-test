HISTORY:

72 y.o. male with a history of renal

disease on dialysis, DM 2, HTN referred for routine EEG after a


possible seizure during dialysis.


MEDICATIONS:


The following medications were autofilled, but the patient was

unable to confirm

daily. Start day before the biopsy

simvastatin (ZOCOR) 5 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth nightly.

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 600 mg tablet, Take 600 mg by mouth daily.


furosemide (LASIX) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth daily.

glipizide (GLUCOTROL XL) 10 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth

daily.


atenolol (TENORMIN) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth daily.




tadalafil (CIALIS) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth once a

week.


Blood Sugar Diagnostic (ASCENSIA CONTOUR) Strip, 1 strip by

Misc.(Non-Drug; Combo Route) route 4 times daily (before meals


and nightly).

Insulin Needles, Disposable, (BD INSULIN PEN NEEDLE UF MINI) 31 x

3/16 " Needle, 1 Device by Misc.(Non-Drug; Combo Route) route

daily. Use as directed


NIFEdipine (PROCARDIA XL) 30 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 30 mg by mouth

daily.


hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by

mouth daily.

Omega-3 Fatty Acids-Vitamin E (FISH OIL) 1,000 mg Cap, Take 1,000

mg by mouth daily.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5-9


Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen with occasional sleep onset frontally


predominant intermittent rhythmic delta activity at 1 Hz, with

runs </= 6 sec (sleep onset FIRDA).



Sleep transients are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Frequent small sharp monophasic spikes are seen independently

in the bilateral temporal chains during drowsiness.  These have


the appearance of a benign variant (small sharp spikes, SSS;

a.k.a. BETS, benign epileptiform transients of sleep)



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional


abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION / CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



Sleep onset FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)


has been reported as a normal pattern in the elderly.



The frequent small sharp spikes seen independently over the

bilateral temporal regions in drowsiness have the appearance of a


benign variant (small sharp spikes, also known as benign

epileptiform transients of sleep, or BETS).
