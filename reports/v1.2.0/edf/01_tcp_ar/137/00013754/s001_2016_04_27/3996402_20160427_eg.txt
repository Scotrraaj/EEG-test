DATE OF STUDY: 04/27/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only





HISTORY:

a 62 y.o. male with a history of cardiac arrest with subsequent coma.



MEDICATIONS:

Klonopin



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.


The background consists of attenuated slow polymorphic delta activity.





No normal sleep architecture  is captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal comatose portable routine EEG due to:


1. Marked background slowing

2. Lack of background reactivity.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate etiologically nonspecific marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
