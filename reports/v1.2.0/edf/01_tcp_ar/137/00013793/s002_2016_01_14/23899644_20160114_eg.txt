HISTORY: 82 y.o. male with a history of recurrent events concerning for seizures.    MEDICATIONS: Current Outpatient Prescriptions: gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 100 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth 3 times daily. NILANDRON 150 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET DAILY dorzolamide-timolol (COSOPT) 2-0.5 % ophthalmic solution, Place 1 drop into both eyes 2 times daily. travoprost, benzalkonium, (TRAVATAN) 0.004 % ophthalmic solution, Place 1 drop into both eyes nightly. amlodipine-benazepril (LOTREL) 10-20 mg per capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.  No current facility-administered medications for this visit.   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1   The background consists of low amplitude 7 Hz theta posteriorly with poor AP gradient and excess polymorphic theta activity.  During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.    PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured heart rate of 66 bpm.  IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal ~20 hour long term video EEG due to: Mild to moderate diffuse slowing.  This finding is indicative of mild -to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
