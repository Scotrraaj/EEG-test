HISTORY:

81 y.o. male who presents with change in

mental status, concerning for a seizure.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


NILANDRON 150 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET DAILY

dorzolamide-timolol (COSOPT) 2-0.5 % ophthalmic solution, Place 1

drop into both eyes 2 times daily.


travoprost, benzalkonium, (TRAVATAN) 0.004 % ophthalmic solution,

Place 1 drop into both eyes nightly.

amlodipine-benazepril (LOTREL) 10-20 mg per capsule, Take 1


capsule by mouth daily.


No AEDs









SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The background consists of low amplitude 7 Hz theta posteriorly

with poor AP gradient and excess polymorphic theta activity.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.





EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A regular heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

Diffuse slowing - mild-to-moderate


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy portable EEG due to

mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing.  This finding is indicative of


mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is

etiologically nonspecific.

When compared to the study from 1/2016, there has not been

significant change.
