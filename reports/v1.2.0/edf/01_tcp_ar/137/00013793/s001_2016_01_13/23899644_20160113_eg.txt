History:	81 year old man with a recent stroke and confusion.
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake
Description:
The background consists of low amplitude 7 Hz theta activity, posteriorly, poor AP gradient, diffuse 
polymorphic excess theta activity and occasional diffuse polymorphic delta activity.  Patient 
remains awake throughout the study.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
	No epileptiform discharges
	No stage 2 sleep
	Disorganization, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only portable 22-minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse 
slowing and disorganization. These findings are indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral 
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
