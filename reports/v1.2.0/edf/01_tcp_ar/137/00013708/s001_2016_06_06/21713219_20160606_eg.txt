HISTORY:

61 y.o. WOMAN R HANDED. PT ADMITTED FOR  CHANGE IN MENTAL
STATUS. PT IS ON ISOLATION CONTACT DROPLET. PMHX. NO H/O SZ, STROKES, 1986 RIGHT
SIDE.56 CM HEAD


MEDICATIONS:


CEFTRIAXONE,BACTRIM,HEPARIN,VANCOMYCIN,ATIVAN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region.

2. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the right anterior
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
