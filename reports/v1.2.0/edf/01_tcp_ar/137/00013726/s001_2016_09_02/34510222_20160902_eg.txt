HISTORY:

67 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR OF
PARARENAL ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM WITH SMA STENT, LONG OR CASE, EEG REQ
DUE TO PT NOT WAKING UP




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.




With verbal, tactile and noxious stimulation the background appears to be reactive and variable.
There is slightly faster frequencies and higher amplitude waveforms.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 132 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Moderate to severe generalized slow waves


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal routine EEG due to diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
