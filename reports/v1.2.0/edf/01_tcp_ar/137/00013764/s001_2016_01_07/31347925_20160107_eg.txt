History:	42 year old woman with a history of seizures.  Patient has a VNS.
Medications:	LAMICTAL,TOPAMAX,GABAPENTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
The background is sharply contoured.  It consists of 10 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity 
posteriorly, expected AP gradient, and mild excess of diffuse theta activity.  Intermittent dorwsiness 
is captured  and consists of loss of PDR, appearance of theta activity and symmetrical vertex waves.
  On at least 3 occasions (2:18:33 pm, 2:26:21 pm and 2:28:09 pm) generalized frontally 
predominant poorly formed fast high amplitude spikes with aftergoing slow waves with associated 
low amplitude polyspikes are captured.  They occur in brief bursts of 0.3-0.5 sec in duration.  There 
are many other frontally predominant high amplitude waveforms that are sharp in appearance but 
not well formed/ organized.
  Periodic low amplitude artifact lasting nearly 40 seconds appears throughout the recording on a 
single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
	Artifact, other, VNS in EKG lead
	Spike-and-wave complexes, fast, few, poorly formed
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing, overall 
sharply contoured background and several brief bursts of poorly formed generalized spikes and 
wave dishcharges with accompanying polyspikes. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse 
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Generalized epileptiform discharges are 
suggestive of generalized type of epilepsy, however, secondary bisynchrony cannot be excluded, 
especially in a patient with a reported prior head trauma - please correlate clinically.  Periodic 
artifact caused by a VNS is noted on a single EKG lead.
