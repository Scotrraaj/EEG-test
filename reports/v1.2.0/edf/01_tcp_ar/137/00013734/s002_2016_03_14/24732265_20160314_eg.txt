HISTORY:

33 y.o. FEMALE HAD SZ.  PT WITH

H/O SEIZURES.



MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

poorly organized theta frequencies, with 7 Hertz posterior


dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient

of frequency and amplitude is not present.



Frequent bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves

occur throughout the recording.



Diffuse excess 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. FIRDA

2. Diffuse slow


3. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to diffuse


background slowing and FIRDA.  These findings are etiologically

nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral

dysfunction. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the

medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
