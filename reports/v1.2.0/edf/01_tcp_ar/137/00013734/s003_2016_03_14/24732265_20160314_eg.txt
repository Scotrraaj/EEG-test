RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: 

EEG TYPE: long term monitoring





HISTORY:

 a 34 y.o. female with a history of seizure in the neurology clinic today referred for EEG
for characterization of seizures. Has history of previous infarcts.



MEDICATIONS:

alprazolam (XANAX) 1 mg tablet,


levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet,

fentaNYL (DURAGESIC) 50 mcg/hr,

divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 500 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily.


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 40 mg tablet, Take one tablet daily

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


alprazolam (XANAX) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

traZODone (DESYREL) 50 mg tablet, Take one tablet daily



acetaminophen-codeine (TYLENOL-CODEINE #3) 300-30 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth
every 4 hours as needed for Pain.


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 650 mg CR tablet, Take 650 mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed for
Pain.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with
T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and
included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation. At some points the patient was
manipulating her electrodes. She was briefly disconnected as well.





DAY 1 (3/14/16-3/15/2016, 14:00)



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is dynamic. There are two specific wake patterns.



The first is characterized by the presence of a

fairly organized symmetric mixture of theta, alpha, and delta


frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7-8 Hertz posterior

dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient

of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal. The patient is more awake on 3/14/16.



In addition, there is very frequent 1-2 Hz frontally predominant rhythmic

delta activity (FIRDA), lasting up to 20 seconds, in wakefulness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and further


background slowing with resolution of FIRDA are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric sleep spindles and K-complexes. POSTS were identified. Slow

wave sleep was captured. FIRDA is not seen in sleep.



Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.



No focal slowing is present.



Posterior dominant rhythm was scant



The background is  Reactive and variable.


There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY - FIRDA



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


EVENTS: None



EKG: A single lead captured 60



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

1. Marked background slowing


2. Prominent bursts of FIRDA



Clinical Correlation

This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. Contributing factors may include
patients existing white matter disease or medications. No seizures were recorded.



Reading attending: 

This EEG was reviewed initially by the epilepsy attending on call at the time of service.
