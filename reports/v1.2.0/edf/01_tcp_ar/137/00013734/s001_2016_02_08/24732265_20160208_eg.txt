HISTORY:

33 y.o. FEMALE R HANDED PT WENT TO SLEEP AND

HUSBAND WAS NEXT TO HER IN AM AND SEEN BLOOD FROM HER MOUTH AND


VERY LETHARGIC. PMHX. BOARDERLINE DM. 55 CM HEAD


MEDICATIONS:


ERTHROMYCIN, SALINE, ACYCLOVIR


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The limited waking background is characterized by the presence of


a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies,

with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm


(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present. There is excessive beta seen diffusely.

Mainly there is also excessive theta in wakefulness.  During

drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen. The EEG is mainly in sleep which is


characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and

symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave

sleep was not captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not

performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Excessive theta in wakefulness


2. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to mild

diffuse slowing which is indicative of diffuse cerebral

dysfunction. This findings are non-specific with regards to


etiology. The excess beat may be seen with benzodiazepine or

barbiturate use. No seizures were seen.
