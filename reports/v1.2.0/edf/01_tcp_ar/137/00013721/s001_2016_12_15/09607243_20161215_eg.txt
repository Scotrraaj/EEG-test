HISTORY: 49 y.o. female with a history of Medically refractory epilepsy, s/p multiple focal seizures yesterday, requiring intubation, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures. Now extubated, follows commands.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: Propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL lorazepam (ATIVAN) tablet 2 mg enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg amlodipine (NORVASC) tablet 20 mg hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) tablet 25 mg lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 20 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion SEDATION: Propofol ALL:  PHT TECHNIQUE: A 1 hour bedside portable  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation. BP (!) 163/75 Pulse 95 Temp 97.8 °F (36.6 °C) Resp (!) 27  Ht 5' (1.524 m)  Wt 281 lb 8.4 oz (127.7 kg)  SpO2 100%  Breastfeeding? No BMI 54.98 kg/m2  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of a Poorly organized symmetric mixture of theta and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7-8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. The PDR is not frequently found.  During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse theta are seen.   Sleep is not well characterized  Moderate generalized slowing is present.   Shifting focal slowing is present, R>L.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s)  Medium to high amplitude Right temporal sharp waves, T2 T4  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: patient alerts, will follow commands  EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal 1 hour awake and asleep routine EEG due to: 1.Generalized slowing 2. Right temporal sharp waves 3. More subtle R focal slowing   CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generalized slowing supports a diffuse process, (post ictal or other cause). Focal sharp waves support focal mechanism for epilepsy. No seizures were recorded.  Given the severity of this patient's epilepsy and the frequency with which she requires hospitalization for epilepsy, consideration for elective inpatient EEG monitoring may be helpful in obtaining better control for her epilepsy
