HISTORY:

31 y.o. female with a history of seizures

referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


alprazolam (XANAX) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 0.5 mg by mouth nightly as

needed.

buPROPion (WELLBUTRIN SR) 150 mg 12 hr tablet, Take 150 mg by


mouth daily.

QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth at

bedtime.


zolpidem (AMBIEN) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth nightly as

needed.

alprazolam (XANAX) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth 3 times daily


as needed.




hydrocortisone valerate (WESTCORT) 0.2 % cream, Apply  topically

2 times daily.


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2

times daily.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening. Lambda waves are seen during wakefulness, which

is a normal feature.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric POSTs, sleep spindles and K-complexes.

Slow wave sleep was not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric

background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hr EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hr EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.
