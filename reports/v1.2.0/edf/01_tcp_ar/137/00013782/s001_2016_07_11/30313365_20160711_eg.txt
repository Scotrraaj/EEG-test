HISTORY:

30 y.o. MALE R HANDED. PTWAS SITTING WITH FRIEND WHEN HE
SAID HE DID NOT FEEL GOOD AND COULD NOT MOVE AND TOLD HIS FRIEND TO CALL EMS
AND HIS FRIEND PICKED HIM UP AND CARRIED HIM INTO THE  CAR AND WENT TO
EPISCOPALWHERE HE WAS GIVEN ATIVAN AND BENADRYL.




MEDICATIONS:


No AEDs


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation. However the O1 electrode may have
been misplaced.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There
appears to be an asymmetry in the voltage of the PDR but this is likely related to electrode distance
misplacement.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F7/T3 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
focal slowing in the left fronto temporal region



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



1. Frequent focal slowing in the left fronto-temporal region.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to frequent focal slowing in the left fronto-
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific.
