DATE OF STUDY: 04/25/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy



HISTORY:

a 53 y.o. WOMAN WITH H/O SZ. SCHIZOPHRENIA, DELUSIONS, PARANOIA,
PREOCCUPATION REFERRED FOR ROUTINE EEG



MEDICATIONS:

ACETAMINOPHEN, HALDOL, HYDROXYZINE, BENZTROPINE, KLONOPIN, LAMICTAL,
DIPHENHYDRAMINE, LORAZEPAM




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent F8/T4 sharp waves at times in runs seen in wakefulness and drowsiness. They do not appear
to evolve and have no  Reported clinical correlate.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Right anterior temporal sharp waves, frequent

2. Right anterior focal slowing, frequent

3. Excess beta





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability in the right anterior
temporal region. They are highly epileptogenic and can be consistent with a diagnosis of
localization related epilepsy in the appropriate clinical setting. Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
