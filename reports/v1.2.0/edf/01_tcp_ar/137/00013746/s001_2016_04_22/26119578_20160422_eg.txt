HISTORY:

55 y.o. WOMAN FROM OS NURSING HOME  FOUND NOT

TO BE HERSELF SINCE SUNDAY.


PMHX: HTN, DM, CAD MORBID OBESITY, OSA ANEMIC.


MEDICATIONS:


HEPARIN, BREVIBLOC


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

limited record due to high impedances and movement artifact which


soul not be fixed and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was

characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity


with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies.


Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Moderate to severe diffuse background slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal limited awake only routine EEG due to diffuse

background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are

etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral


dysfunction.

Please note the low quality of the record.
