HISTORY:

71 y.o. female with a history of seizures in her 30s (seizure-free x10 yrs),
presenting after being found down at home, brought to ER, had seizure in CT scanner, referred for
routine EEG for characterization of seizures.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha with excess theta and delta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present but suboptimal.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Frequent 1.5 Hz frontally predominant generalized rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA, aka GRDA -
generalized rhythmic delta activity) for runs <10 sec



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Frequent 1.5 Hz frontally predominant generalized rhythmic delta activity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a mild-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

Frontally predominant generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA, also known as FIRDA) is a
nonspecific but pathologic finding that is most commonly seen in toxic-metabolic states, but may
also be seen with deep structural lesions or increased intracranial pressure. Clinical correlation is
advised.
