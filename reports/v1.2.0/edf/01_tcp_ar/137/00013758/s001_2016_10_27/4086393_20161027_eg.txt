SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



Excess beta activity is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Patient rapidly transitions from wakefulness to sleep.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) is captured.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 80 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Presence of FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)




CLINICAL CORRELATION:



FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) is seen in the setting of encephalopathy, increased
ICP and bilateral white matter lesions.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.



Patient rapidly transitions from wakefulness to sleep - please correlate clinically with an excessively
drowsy patient vs an underlying sleep disorder.
