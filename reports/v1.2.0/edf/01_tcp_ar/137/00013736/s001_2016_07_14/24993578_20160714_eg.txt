TECHNIQUE:


A 1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International
10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically
satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.3 Hertz , 70 uV amplitude alpha rhythm posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Focal slowing is present in drowsiness and is characterized by intermittent theta or disruption of faster
frequency activity in the left temporal region.

Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

A single burst of left 3-4 Hz TIRDA was noted in drowsiness. Duration 2 seconds.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Elicits bilateral driving.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG:


1. Left temporal focal slowing and left temporal TIRDA.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG.

This EEG is similar to previous studies which identified left temporal focal slowing and left temporal
TIRDA.
