HISTORY:

71 y.o. male WITH SZS, ASTHMA, COPD, HLD,

CVA.  RRR CALLED FOR SZ. RIGHT SIDE JERKING AND EYES DEVIATED TO


RIGHT.  GIVEN 4 MG ATIVAN. STOPPED


MEDICATIONS:


Dilantin, Keppra and ativan.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity

was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta activity with


absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies.


Sleep is not captured





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

There is a continuous C3/P3 low amplitude beta sharply contoured

irregular discharge with frequent intermixed sharp waves seen

throughout the record. This does not appear clearly evolve but


does seem to change frequency. There is no clinical correlate

noted on video. This pattern is most consistent with a continuous


focal subclinical seizure.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Left centro parietal continuous discharge and sharp waves


consistent with subclinical focal status

2. Diffuse slow, moderate to severe



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to

continuous electrographic status arising from the left centro


parietal region.  This finding is indicative of an epileptogenic

focus in the region. In addition there is diffuse background

slowing. This finding is indicative of moderate to severe diffuse

cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. This


findings were communicated to the primary team.
