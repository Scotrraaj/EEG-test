HISTORY: 71 y.o. male with a history of post-stroke seizures (L posterior MCA), asthma, COPD, HLD, who presented with right gaze deviation and right sided twitching in the setting of recent AICD revision.
MEDICATIONS: s/p Ativan 4 mg Keppra 1000 mg x2, then 750 mg q12h Dilantin 20 mg/kg load, then 100 mg q8h Depakote 40 mg/kg load, then 500 mg q6h  SEDATION: meds as above  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.

DAY 1 (1/29/2016, 12:32 - 1/30/2016 06:00)  BACKGROUND, EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY, EVENTS:  The record opens to electrographic seizures seen best over the left posterior quadrant.  A total of 214 seizures are seen before intubation occurs at 15:53.   CLINICAL: On video review, during periods of muscle artifact there is slow contraction of the left mouth and left arm. EEG: Episodes begin with onset of beta buzz over left posterior quadrant (T3, T5, C3, P3, O1) that evolves into alpha and then often becomes obscured by muscle artifact for up to 30 seconds. When the muscle artifact resolves, there is rhythmic delta with embedded spikes, then suppression of background for <5 seconds, then the pattern repeats itself. Each episode lasts about 2 minutes.  Following intubation the patient is started on a versed gtt, 2 mg/hr, up to 4 mg/hr, but decreased to 2 mg/hr due to hypotension. At this time, background consists of low amplitude fast frequency activity and is not clearly reactive or variable. There is severe generalized slowing.   By 20:35, there is development of sharply contoured theta waves with underlying rhythmic delta over the left parasagittal region, maximal over C3. Eventually these discharges develop frank spikes/sharp waves over the left posterior quadrant and occur continually at 0.5-1 Hz.  Seizures resume again on 1/30/2016 00:08 with the same electrographic pattern as above.  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate that was at times irregular.
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Ongoing left posterior quadrant status epilepticus 2. Severe generalized slowing, which is at least in part related to medication effect

-----------------------------------------------------------------
DAY 2 (1/30/2016, 06:00 - 1/31/2016, 06:00)  MEDICATIONS: Dilantin 100 mg q8h, free level 2.5 VPA 500 mg q6h, level 63 - repleted Keppra 750 mg q12h Versed gtt re-started  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Continuous left posterior quadrant sharp waves/spikes at 0.5-1 Hz (lateralized periodic discharges, LPD+F); as day progresses these stand out less from background  EVENTS: multiple seizures are captured with same electrographic pattern as previous day:  03:51, 04:07, 04:16, 04:22, 04:46, 04:22, 04:46, 04:54, 04:58, 05:09, 05:27, 05:31, 05:41, 05:48, 06:00, 06:02, 06:07, 06:19 x2, 06:28, 06:36, 06:45, 06:46, 06:58, 07:13, 07:16, 07:26, 07:34, 07:43, 07:55, 08:09, 08:27, 08:30, 08:37, 08:52, 10:12, 11:20, 12:06, 19:38  **Note that study is lost on 1/30 between 14:51 and 19:33  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate that was at times irregular
DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Left posterior quadrant status epilepticus with most recent seizure at 19:38 on 1/30/2016 2. Severe generalized slowing, which is at least in part related to medication effect

-----------------------------------------------------------------
DAY 3 (1/31/2016, 06:00 - 2/1/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: Becomes discontinuous with abundant periods of suppression lasting 2-3 seconds intermixed with disorganized alpha, beta, theta, and fast frequencies  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: 1. Subtle left posterior quadrant bursts of fast activity at 0.5-1 Hz (lateralized periodic discharges, LPD+F). As day progresses, these bursts of fast activity become longer, up to 5 seconds, but do not clearly evolve. These resolve as the day progresses  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate that was at times irregular
DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No seizures. Epileptiform bursts resolve on this day. Background becomes more discontinuous, likely a medication effect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
DAY 4 (2/1/2016, 06:00 - 2/2/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: No change. As day progresses, spontaneous eyeblink artifact is seen.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Rare (<1hour) left posterior quadrant (C3/P3/T5) sharp waves.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured an irregular heartbeat.
DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No seizures. Rare left posterior quadrant sharp waves. Severe generalized slowing, as on prior day, likely at least in part due to medication effect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
DAY 5 (2/2/2016, 06:00 - 2/3/2016, 07:56)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 90's
DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Severe generalized slowing as on prior days. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Satus epilepticus with seizures originating from the left posterior quadrant, with the last seizure on 1/30 at 19:38 2. Left posterior quadrant epileptogenic discharges, resolving over the course of the study 3. Severe generalized slowing with disorganized background and lack of reactivity, likely at least in part due to a medication effect 4. A heart rate that was at times irregular was noted on a single EKG lead.

FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are diagnostic for focal epilepsy, with seizures of left posterior quadrant origin. Severe generalized slowing is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of severe diffuse dysfunction, which is likely at least in part due to a medication effect. A heart rate that was at times irregular was captured on a single EKG lead.
