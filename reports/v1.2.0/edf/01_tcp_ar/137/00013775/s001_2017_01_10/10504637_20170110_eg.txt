DATE OF STUDY: 01/10/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy



HISTORY:

a 49 y.o. FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O RT CVA 6/2015. NOW WITH C/C OF
SHORT/NEW MEMORY LOSS



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

metFORMIN (GLUCOPHAGE) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth daily. Indications: HYPERTENSION


hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth daily.

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth daily.

rivaroxaban (XARELTO) 20 mg Tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.


There is at times an excess diffuse 5-7 Hz activity is seen in wakefulness and also diffuse intermixed,
frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Excess theta in wakefulness



2. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing.  This
finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
