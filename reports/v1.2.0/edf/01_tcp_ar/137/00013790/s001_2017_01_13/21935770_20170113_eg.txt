DATE OF STUDY: 01/13/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep


HISTORY:

A 33 y.o. male with a history of a flurry of generalized convulsions, referred for routine
EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

ampicillin-sulbactam (UNASYN) 1.5 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB MB+


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:





A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of mildly disorganized symmetric 7-9 Hertz
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) and low voltage anteriorly predominant 18-30 Hz activity.



During much of the tracing, the patient was drowsy or asleep. During drowsiness, slow rolling eye
movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by increased generalized low to medium amplitude slowing, with synchronous
and symmetric vertex waves, and sleep spindles. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 82 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild background disorganization and diffuse slowing during brief wakefulness.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:







These findings are nonspecific and indicate the presence of a mild bihemispheric functional
disturbance such as that seen with a variety of mild generalized encephalopathies of various
etiologies. Similar changes can also be seen during periods of drowsiness.
