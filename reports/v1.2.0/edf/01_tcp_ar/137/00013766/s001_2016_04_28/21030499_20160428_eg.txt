Current facility-administered medications for this visit.

Vancomycin


SEDATION: Ativan


TECHNIQUE:


Bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.  The
patient was agitated and ativan was given to reduce movement artifact.




EEG BACKGROUND:

After Ativan,t he background is characterized by the presence a theta background with intermittent
brief (>2 sec) attenuations.  Stimulation elicits beta.  The overall background is sharply contoured.


Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.

Triphasic waves (few) are noted


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

In this sharply contoured records, sporadic sharp waves are noted at T4, F3> T1



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is  reactivity to  auditory,  or noxious stimuli.




EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. Markedly slow background

2. Irritative pattern with few independent sharp waves noted from either hemisphere.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  The
sharp waves notes above may merit a repeat study after the acute illness resolves.  Vigilance at this
time to identify subtle seizures is suggested.
