START DATE OF STUDY: 09/10/16 at 12:10 END DATE OF STUDY: 09/11/16 at 09:26  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:  EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 73 y.o. female with a history of CAD, DM2, HTN, CKD III, PVD, afib, PAD who p/w aphasia and L hemiparesis - found to have large R MCA stroke, s/p thrombectomy, now referred for EEG for assessment of mental status change / to screen for subclinical seizures.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 10 Units lactated ringers infusion ipratropium-albuterol (DUO-NEB) nebulizer solution 3 mL insulin regular (HumuLIN R,NovoLIN R) injection 2-10 Units pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg carbidopa-levodopa (SINEMET) 25-100 mg per tablet 1 tablet levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN) 750 mg in dextrose 5 % 150 mL IVPB digoxin (LANOXIN) injection 0.125 mg metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 5 mg in dextrose 5 % 50 mL IVPB erythromycin (ROMYCIN) 5 mg/gram (0.5 %) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application hydrALAZINE (APRESOLINE) injection 10 mg amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) packet 17 g argatroban 50 mg (1 mg/mL) in sodium chloride (iso-os) 50 mL infusion aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL labetalol (NORMODYNE,TRANDATE) injection 10 mg dextrose 5 % in water solution 1,000 mL lidocaine (LMX) 4 % cream 1 Application acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 80 mg ezetimibe (ZETIA) tablet 10 mg dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg  SEDATION: None listed  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (9/10/2016, 12:10 - 9/11/2016, 09:26)  BACKGROUND: Background is continuous and asymmetric.  The left hemisphere consists of mostly disorganized theta with admixed faster frequencies. The right hemisphere consists of more attenuated, also disorganized, theta.  There is no posterior dominant rhythm.  The background does not clearly react to noxious stimulation. Drowsy and asleep states are characterized by further subtle slowing of the background.  There is moderate to severe generalized slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate that was at times irregular  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate-severe generalized slowing 2. Right hemisphere attenuation of faster frequencies 3. Irregular heart rate  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are consistent with a right hemisphere cortical dysfunction, likely structural (given history of right MCA infarct), in the setting of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
