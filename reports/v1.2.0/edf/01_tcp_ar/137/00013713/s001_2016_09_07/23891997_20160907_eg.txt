DATE OF STUDY: 09/07/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 73 y.o. female with a history of CAD, diabetes, hypertension, CKD, atrial
fibrillation, status post cerebral thrombectomy following a right MCA stroke on 8/25 presenting with
language disturbance and left hemiparesis, referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical
seizures.




MEDICATIONS:


ipratropium-albuterol (DUO-NEB) nebulizer solution 3 mL

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg

carbidopa-levodopa (SINEMET) 25-100 mg per tablet 1 tablet


insulin glargine

levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN) 750 mg in dextrose 5 % 150 mL IVPB

digoxin (LANOXIN) injection 0.125 mg


metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 5 mg in dextrose 5 % 50 mL IVPB

morphine injection 2 mg

erythromycin (ROMYCIN) 5 mg/gram (0.5 %) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application


hydrALAZINE (APRESOLINE) injection 10 mg


amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg

argatroban 50 mg (1 mg/mL) in sodium chloride (iso-os) 50 mL infusion


aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg

labetalol (NORMODYNE,TRANDATE) injection 10 mg


midazolam (VERSED)

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 80 mg

ezetimibe (ZETIA) tablet 10 mg





SEDATION: Versed


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient was drowsy during much of the study, able to move her right greater than left side on
command The background is characterized by low voltage 5-6 Hz activity best seen over the left
hemisphere, with voltage attenuation on the right. Low amplitude fairly widespread beta activity with
superimposed muscle, movement and 60 cycle artifact





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 88 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy routine EEG due to:


1. Voltage attenuation over the right hemisphere. The patient was not fully alert during the study and
assessment of normal waking background could therefore not be made.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a functional disturbance over the right hemisphere without
any clinical or electrographic seizure activity recorded.
