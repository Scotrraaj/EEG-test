HISTORY: A 27-year-old woman, who for the past year has founded after she drinks heavily, she has a jerky twitchiness or jitteriness. On October 17, after consuming half a bottle of Hennessy and Red Bull, she had the twitching followed by 2 episodes of generalized shaking with loss of consciousness. She did not bite her tongue or lose control of her bladder and by her recollection, she had no postictal impairment. No other known epilepsy risk factors.  

INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. A mild asymmetry is noted in this record. The activity is a little higher in the left frontotemporal region and there is a slightly asymmetric eye artifacts, but it does appear to be occasional, intermittent, underlying slowing in the left frontotemporal region. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS noted in stage 2 sleep.   Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude bilaterally, again more so on the left and the right. Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving. Next, the bilateral driving response was seen during stage 2 sleep.   Heart rate 60-90 bpm.  

IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to: 1. mild left temporal amplitude asymmetry 2. a subtle area of slowing in the left frontotemporal region.  

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definitive epileptiform features were identified. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing, capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested. Correlation with imaging is suggested.
