TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient was intubated and unresponsive. Background demonstrated generalized voltage
suppression with low low to medium amplitude bilateral 1.5-5 Hz activity, maximum over
frontocentral regions. A moderate amount of muscle artifact and intermittent anteriorly predominant
triphasiform-like activity was seen, at times somewhat more prominent on the left.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72  bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal bedside  EEG due to:

1. Voltage attenuation and diffuse slowing .

2. Intermittent atypical anteriorly predominant triphasiform activity.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are nonspecific and indicate a bihemispheric functional disturbance. No clinical or
electrographic seizures and no pathologic paroxysmal epileptiform discharges were recorded.
