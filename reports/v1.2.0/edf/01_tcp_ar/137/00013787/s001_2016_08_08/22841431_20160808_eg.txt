SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and intermittent theta activity with some central faster frequencies and a posterior dominant rhythm
that at best reached 8 Hz.




State changes can be seen but typical sleep architecture can be seen.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate diffuse slow waves


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to moderate diffuse background slowing and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
