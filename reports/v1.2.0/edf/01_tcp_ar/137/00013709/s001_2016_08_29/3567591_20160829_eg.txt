HISTORY:

89 y.o. WOMAN WITH CC OF SEIZURE.  PMHX: DM, HTN, HLD, CAD, CKD.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.


Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. Normal sleep is not captured but
some vertex waves can be seen.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate diffuse slow



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to moderate diffuse background slowing and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
