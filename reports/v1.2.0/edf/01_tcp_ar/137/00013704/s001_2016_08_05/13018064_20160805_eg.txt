DATE OF STUDY: 08/05/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 21 y.o. Female with h/o MANY DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES and PMHX.
CEREBRAL PALSY,SZ..



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

NAPROXEN SODIUM (ALEVE PO), Take  by mouth.

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, (VITAMIN D) 1,000 unit Capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional symmetric generalized spike and wave seen, most prominent in frontal region, with
frequency of 4-4.5 Hz and lasting 1-1.5 seconds. No associated clinical or EKG change.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Occasional symmetric generalized spike and wave seen, most prominent in frontal region, with
frequency of 4-4.5 Hz and lasting 1-1.5 seconds.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings of occasional symmetric generalized spike and wave indicate the presence of possible
generalized epilepsy.
