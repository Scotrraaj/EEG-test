HISTORY:

60 y.o. male with a history of traumatic brain injury in 2011 with subsequent VP
shunt and seizure disorder, admitted with tentorial subarachnoid hemorrhage after a fall down steps,
referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.

SEDATION: Propofol


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient was intubated and sedated with propofol and fentanyl. Background demonstrates left
hemispheric voltage attenuation. A moderate amount of irregular 3-4 Hz activity was seen over
widespread scalp regions along with low voltage 7-10 Hz activity over the frontocentral regions,
higher in amplitude on the right. Occasional right central and anterior hemispheric sharp waves are
seen at F4, C4 and T4.





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep ICU bedside EEG due to:

1. Generalized slowing.


2. Voltage attenuation over the left hemisphere.

3. Right frontocentral sharp waves at F4, T4, and C4.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of bifrontal cortical dysfunction, greater over the left
hemisphere, with irritative discharges (sharp waves) anteriorly and centrally on the right. No clinical or
electrographic seizures were recorded.
