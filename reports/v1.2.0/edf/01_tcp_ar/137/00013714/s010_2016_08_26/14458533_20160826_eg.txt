SEDATION: see above
TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.
DAY 1 (8/24/2016*- 8/24/2016, - EEG stopped for OR, then held until next AM when scalp not so acutely post op)
BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by a markedly asymmetric pattern. The left hemisphere demonstrates a low voltage, relatively featureless pattern with slow low-voltage delta and smaller amounts of theta and alpha frequency activity. On the right, there is a breach rhythm with higher amplitude theta and alpha frequency activity. In the context of breach rhythm, there is a broadly contoured right temporal sharp wave. Tactile stimulation produces an increase in faster frequency activity, better defined on the right. There is variability in the record with an increase in faster frequency activity noted in the right hemisphere. Marked generalized slowing is present. Focal slowing is present. Breach rhythm is seen  There were persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  R sharp waves in context of breach
EVENTS: None
EKG: A single lead captured HR 120
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Marked focal slowing and relative suppression on the left Breach rhythm noted on the right with sharp waves and paroxysmal slowing but no definitive seizures. EEG monitoring was discontinued when the patient went to the operating room to have his hematomas drained
---------------------------------- -------------------------------

DAY 2 (- 8/25/2016, 10:00- 8/26/2016,) Medications Depakote, Lamictal. Patient was weaned off pressors and Propofol. He was then started on fentanyl and Versed. On the afternoon of the 25th, Versed dose was increased to control seizures and then patient transitioned back to Propofol

BACKGROUND: the activity from the left is markedly suppressed. From the right, particularly in the early hours of the record, there are intermittent, repetitive seizures at characteristic evolution of initially fast activity and then fade activity. Seizures are from the right hemisphere particularly right posterior quadrant. The results were communicated to the clinical team who subsequently adjusted medications and at 4 PM, patient returned to Propofol infusion   By 10 PM the seizures were abating. The patient's Propofol dose was 50, VPA level 37, free Phenytoin level 1.2 There is a subtle but ongoing ictal pattern with bursts, typically 10-17 seconds duration with low voltage R temporal 3.75 Hz activity, but with frequency evolution in the first and last second.
EVENTS: the clinical exam was remarkable for an intubated, comatose patient. All seizures were electrographic only
EKG: A single EKG lead captured 80 BPM

DAY2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  The initial pattern was electrographic status epilepticus with seizures from the right hemisphere. Ictal patterns are more subtle by the end of this section, low voltage, but with clear ictal pattern discernable at slow "paper speed” Findings and plan of care discussed with NSICU team.

BACKGROUND: No change No reactivity
GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change
FOCAL SLOWING: No change
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None
SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: in the initial hours, there was an ictal pattern of paroxysmal slow, then 3.75 Hz activity then slowing lasting 7-10 seconds. By mid-day, this transitioned to pattern of irregular, low voltage sharply contoured slowing in an otherwise featureless background.   EVENTS: No clinical events reported or detected
EKG: A single EKG lead captured 96 BPM

DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Marked reduction in epileptiform activity and R temp seizures.  Markedly suppressed background, bilateral.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

DAY 4 (8/27/2016 06:00 - 8/28/2016, 06:00) CT from 8/27: Again noted are the bilateral craniotomies with right frontal entering ventricular shunt catheter, unchanged in position. There continues to be a moderate sized extra-axial blood collection beneath the right craniotomy flap, measuring up to 11 mm in diameter, minimally larger. This continues to result in some compression of the right lateral ventricle and mild shift of the midline from right to left measuring approximately 3 mm. Multiple areas of parenchymal hemorrhage, small subdural and/or epidural collections over the left convexity, as well as a large subdural collection along the left tentorium remain and are undergoing expected evolution. Intraventricular blood is layering posteriorly. There continues to be mild uncal shift on the right.
