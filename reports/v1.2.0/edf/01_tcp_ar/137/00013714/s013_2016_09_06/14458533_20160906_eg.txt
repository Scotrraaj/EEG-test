HISTORY:

SEDATION: None listed



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is continuous, symmetric, and consists of disorganized delta with admixed faster
frequencies.


There is no reactivity to noxious stimulation, variability, or state change.



There is severe generalized slowing.

There is no definite focal slowing or attenuation; however, there is abundant sustained muscle
artifact over the left hemispheric leads (video reviewed; no obvious movement associated with this).





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Continuous spikes/polyspike-and-wave at 1 Hz over right posterior quadrant (T6 / P4 / O2 max)
[periodic lateralized discharges (PLEDs / LPD+FR)]




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal coma study portable EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing, with disorganization and lack of reactivity

2. Continuous spikes/polyspike-and-wave at 1 Hz over right posterior quadrant


3. Tachycardia noted on a single EKG lead.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of highly epileptogenic potentials over the right posterior
quadrant, superimposed on a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. There were no definite clinical or
electrographic seizures. Tachycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.


These findings were reviewed with the epileptologist who read patient's prior EEGs and were
reported to be similar.


These findings were also discussed with the neurology consult team and a treatment plan was
formulated.
