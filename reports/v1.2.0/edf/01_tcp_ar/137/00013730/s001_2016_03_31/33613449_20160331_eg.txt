current facility-administered medications for this visit.

KEPPRA, SYNTHROID, FAMOTIDINE, ZOSYN, VANCOMYCIN,



SEDATION: VERSED 2MG (3/30 @ 8PM / 3/31 @ 1:30 AM AND 5:05 AM),

ATIVAN 2MG (12:35PM 03/31), FENTANYL



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with


T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a

technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of


EKG and tactile stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient is intubated, unresponsive in a vest.  There is a


continuous background is characterized by low to medium amplitude

slow delta.  No morphologies of normal wakefulness are noted.


Tactile stimulation of the patient produces 4 Hz theta activity


Sleep is not captured



Significant generalized slowing is present.

No significant focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not

performed.


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal ICU routine EEG due to:


1. bilateral, significant background slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings supporting significant, bihemispheric disturbance


of cerebral function.  The use of sedative hypnotic medications

may play a role in the pattern described above.  The presence of


reactivity to tactile stimulation is a positive prognostic

feature
