HISTORY:

30 y.o. with a history polysubstance abuse, including cocaine, found down
PEA in field. Last recorded temp 94; never on sedation. Referred for routine EEG for altered mental
status.


MEDICATIONS: Protonix, Heparin, Zosyn, Vancomycin



SEDATION: none



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system and
utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of
EKG and EMG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is suppressed, with intermittent theta and delta activity that is not clearly of cerebral
in origin, seen at <10 uV. There is no reactivity to passive eye opening, nor to noxious stimulation
(including ocular stimulation, nasal tickle, and painful stimulation to limbs). There is no variability
nor is there state change.





Profound generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE: A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG

lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal coma study EEG due to:


1. Profound cerebral dysfunction, with background disorganization and lack of reactivity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of profound cerebral dysfunction.
