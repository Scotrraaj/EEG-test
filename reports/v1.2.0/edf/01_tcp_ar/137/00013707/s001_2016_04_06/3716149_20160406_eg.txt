SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Stat bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel

electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International


10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system.

This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single


channel of EKG and  Tactile/auditory stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is obscured by chew artifact, noted continuously.

It is characterized by a low voltage, featureless, mostly delta

pattern. Tactile and verbal stimuli neither alert the patient nor


impact the EEG.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:see above

EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal bedside stat portable  EEG due to:


1. Replacement of normal wake background with delta activity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with toxic or

metabolic encephalopathy. No epileptiform features were seen.
