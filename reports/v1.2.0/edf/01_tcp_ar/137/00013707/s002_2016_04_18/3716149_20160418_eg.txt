Gabapentin


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

verbal stimulation.  The patient had been very agitated prior to


the EEG and had been screaming


EEG BACKGROUND:



Through much of the record, the patient is poorly interactive,

cachectic and staring off into space, typically away from the


examiner.  When she is not interactive, her EEG demonstraes a

high amplitude rhythmic delta pattern with generous beta.

Frequent eye blink and other movements are noted at that time.

When she interacts with the technologist, she has a clear


alerting response and EEG demonstrates a waking background-well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.




Generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


FIRDA


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: See above

EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. FIRDA


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are suggestive of a metabolic encephalopathy.  No


epileptiform features were identified.  The presence of a

relatively normal alerting response is a positive  feature
