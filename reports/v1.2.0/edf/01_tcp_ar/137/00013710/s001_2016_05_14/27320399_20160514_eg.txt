DATE OF STUDY: 05/14/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU 787


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only





HISTORY:

a 97 y.o. male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypertension and diabetes.
Had an episode of hypoglycemia with unresponsiveness and generalized motor activity.  Now
intubated and sedated with propofol referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) 25 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily. Take one tablet
daily x 5 days


clopidogrel (PLAVIX) 75 mg tablet, Take 75 mg by mouth daily.

ketoconazole (NIZORAL) 2 % cream, Apply twice a day to the feet


felodipine (PLENDIL) 10 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

Mineral Oil-Isopropyl Myristat (EUCERIN) Lotion, Apply 1 ampule topically 2 times daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: Propofol



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically limited record
and included a single channel of EKG and  verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The  background is initially obscured by muscle artifact.  The patient's propofol was increased slightly
to decrease muscle artifact.  This produces a low voltage, relatively symmetric mixed frequency
pattern with low voltage delta, smaller amounts of beta.  There is an intermittent arousal noted with
a lower voltage alpha theta pattern



Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: ThereIS reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72- ireg  bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is  technically limited but an abnormal ICU EEG due to:

1. replacement normal background low-voltage risks frequency pattern



CLINICAL CORRELATION:




These findings are nonspecific, may be seen in the context of use of sedative and chronic
medications, post ictal state, or other diffuse process.  Given the patient's clinical status, long term
monitoring will follow this report
