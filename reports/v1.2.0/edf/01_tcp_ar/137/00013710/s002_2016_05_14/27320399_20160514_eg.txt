HISTORY:

97 y.o. male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypertension and diabetes.
Had an episode of hypoglycemia with unresponsiveness and generalized motor activity.  Now
intubated and sedated with propofol referred for LTM  EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) 25 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily. Take one tablet
daily x 5 days


clopidogrel (PLAVIX) 75 mg tablet, Take 75 mg by mouth daily.

ketoconazole (NIZORAL) 2 % cream, Apply twice a day to the feet


felodipine (PLENDIL) 10 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

Mineral Oil-Isopropyl Myristat (EUCERIN) Lotion, Apply 1 ampule topically 2 times daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: Propofol



TECHNIQUE:


A continuous Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)  Monitor was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically limited record and included a single channel of EKG and  verbal stimulation.

Day 1: May 14-15, 2016


EEG BACKGROUND:

The  background is intermittently obscured by muscle artifact.  When the muscle drops out, the
background includes low voltage, relatively symmetric mixed frequency pattern with low voltage
delta, smaller amounts of beta.  Intermittent arousal noted with a lower voltage alpha theta pattern
and eye movement artifact.  On other occasions arousals are characterized by muscle artifact which
obscures the EEG



Generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There IS reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 104  ireg  bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



Day 1 IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is  technically limited but an abnormal ICU EEG due to:

1. replacement normal background low-voltage mixed frequency pattern


These findings are nonspecific, may be seen in the context of use of sedative and chronic
medications, post ictal state, or other diffuse process.  Given the patient's clinical status, long term
monitoring will follow this report




I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.

DAY 2 (05/15/16, *- 5/16/2016, 06:00)


BACKGROUND:

The  background is intermittently obscured by muscle artifact.  When the muscle drops out, the
background includes low voltage, relatively symmetric mixed frequency pattern with low voltage
delta, smaller amounts of beta.  Intermittent arousal noted with a lower voltage alpha theta pattern
and eye movement artifact.  On other occasions arousals are characterized by muscle artifact which
obscures the EEG




Generalized slowing is present.


Posterior dominant rhythm wasnot present.



The background is  reactive,  variable.



There were  no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.


Sleep was characterized by low-voltage vertex waves.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single lead captured HR 70-90 irreg


DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


The EEG, when interpretable remains slow. As the patient becomes more alert and active, he is
removing electrodes or creating more muscle artifact.








-----------------------------------------------------------------



FINAL IMPRESSION:



This is abnormal video EEG due to:


1. replacement of normal background with a low voltage slow pattern





FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings were noted even 2 days after the start of the EEG and after propofol had been
discontinued and the patient was extubated.  In this clinical context, the EEG is most supportive of a
diffuse disturbance of cerebral function such as a dementing illness or toxic or metabolic
encephalopathy.  No epileptiform features were seen
