including doxepin, prazosin, gabapentin, amphetamine, phenytoin and using heroin.

SEDATION: propofol drip



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is continuous and symmetric but poorly organized with nearly continuous
polymorphic delta activity with abundant superimposed faster frequencies with occasional periods of
<2 seconds of suppression. There is no reactivity to stimulation.




There is no state change or variability. There is no Posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).


Severe generalized slowing is present.



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing, with short periods of suppression, background disorganization, and
lack of reactivity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which
may at least in part be due to ongoing IV sedation.


Excess of fast frequencies can be seen in the setting of medications such as propofol.
