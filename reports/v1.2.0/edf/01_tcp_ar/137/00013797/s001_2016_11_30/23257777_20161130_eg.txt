HISTORY:

21 y.o. male with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs
every 6 hours as needed for Wheezing.

cloNIDine (CATAPRES) 0.2 mg tablet, Take 0.2 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


ARIPiprazole (ABILIFY) 2 mg tablet, Take 2 mg by mouth daily.

diphenhydrAMINE (NIGHT-TIME SLEEP AID) 50 mg capsule, Take 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours as
needed for Itching.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Patient remains awake throughout the recording.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.


No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
