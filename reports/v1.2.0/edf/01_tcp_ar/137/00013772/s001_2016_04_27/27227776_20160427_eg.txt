SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background consists of 9-10 Hz polymorphic alpha activity posteriorly, unstable AP (anterior-to-
posterior) gradient and diffuse excess polymorphic theta activity.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Brief sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
and sleep spindles.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:




None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep 1 -hour routine EEG due to:

1. Mild diffuse slowing





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.


The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
