SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record
(impedences <10 kOhm) and included a single channel of EKG. The patient requested that the study
be terminated after 15 min of recording as she needed to use the bathroom.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous, reactive, and asymmetric.





The left hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mix of alpha, beta, and excess delta frequencies,
with a fragments of an irregular posterior dominant rhythm of 9.5 Hz.


The right hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mix of alpha, theta, and delta, with a posterior
dominant rhythm that is less clearly seen.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Continuous right hemispheric slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal, technically limited, awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Continuous right hemispheric slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of right hemispheric dysfunction (likely structural in etiology)
superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Attenuation of faster frequencies over the right
hemisphere are consistent with this patient's history of right subdural hematoma.



The patient requested that the study be terminated after 15 min of recording as she needed to use
the bathroom.
