HISTORY: 54 y.o. female with a history of recurrent CPS with aphasia referred for EEG for management of seizure exacerbation. "TRANSFER FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL. PT PRESENTS EPISODE OF FOCAL SEIZURE LASTING 10 W/O LOC. DESCRIBED AS WARM FEELING THROUGH UPPER BODY,SHOULDERS AND HEAD." EPILEPSY, BREAST AND LUNG CA. Prior EMU MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA, TRILEPTAL SEDATION: not reported   TECHNIQUE: A continuous video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor  was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal Stimulation.  This data was reviewed and communicated by the physician on call at the time of recording.  This report was generated later.    DAY 1 (- 5/20/2016, 12:00 AM-05/21/2016) BACKGROUND: The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric,  well-organized, and consists predominantly of 7 Hz theta  with admixed beta. Posterior dominant rhythm was  present. The background is  reactive,  variable. There were  persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. L temporal focal slowing  Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured..  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Occasional wicket waves are noted during drowsiness over the temporal  regions  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Occasional (1/hour to <1min) - including periodic slowing from the left temporal region with broad field of spread, maximum at T3-T1, left temporal sharp waves "BIRDS" of approximate 10 seconds in duration were noted on the afternoon of the 20th, after medication adjustment EVENTS:  Multiple electrographic seizures were captured  The EEG begins with the seizure characterized by rhythmic 6-7 Hz data activity.    Medications were adjusted and the ictal pattern changes to more poorly defined bursts of rhythmic theta or bursts of periodic sharp waves.   Typical seizure duration 1-2 minutes. The audio for this EEG recording session is difficult to discern.  Clinical notes indicate that with pharmacotherapy, the patient continued to improve.  By 10:30 7 AM seizures were less frequent and, the patient had an electrographic seizure without change in language noted at 10:30 7 AM.  EKG: A single lead captured 90 BPM  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: An initial pattern of electrographic status epilepticus, improving over time to a pattern of brief intermittent rhythmic repetitive epileptiform discharges without definitive clinical correlate    -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (05/21/2016- 05.22.2016) MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA, TRILEPTAL, Solumedrol, IV IG  BACKGROUND: No change   GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change- mild background slowing FOCAL SLOWING: No change- left temporal focal slowing PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Occasional (1/hour to <1min) relatively simple left temporal sharp waves, left temporal periodic discharges, "BIRDS" Left temporal 10 seconds duration  EVENTS: Clinical events were difficult to define for this individual with some residual aphasia. Intermittent, more poorly defined ictal discharges, with periodic delta and evolving theta were noted, typically about 45 seconds to 2 minutes duration without clear medical correlation Electrographic seizures can be noted in wakefulness through stage II sleep Aura: 9:41 PM- the patient was awake.  There is a great deal of muscle artifact.  Rhythmic theta is noted from the left temporal region but the overall EEG does not significantly different than the interctal pattern. EKG: A single EKG lead captured 90 BPM  DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION Improvement in both the clinical state of the patient in terms of language disorder and of the EEG.  Epileptiform discharges are more poorly defined, less prominent and not associated with clinical change. The single clinical event, the Aura, did not have a good EEG signature, however was partially obscured by muscle.       ----------------------------------------------------------------- DAY 3 (05/22/2016- 05/23/2016) MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA, TRILEPTAL, Solumedrol, IV IG , percocet, others BACKGROUND: Minor changes, stage II sleep identifies less focal slowing and fewer epileptiform discharges GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change FOCAL SLOWING: No change PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): see below ; temporal wicket  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Occasional (1/hour to <1min) relatively simple left temporal sharp waves, left temporal periodic discharges, "BIRDS" Left temporal 10 seconds duration EVENTS:  Although no clinical seizures were noted, and the patient continued to demonstrate improving language, intermittent electrographic discharges of one to two minutes in duration were characterized by rhythmic buildup of delta/beta frequency periodic activity from the left temporal region. These were decreasing in frequency and, in sleep the patient could go as long as an hour without one of these electrical seizures See: 06:37:43- theta frequency seizure - similar to those noted as the study started EKG: A single EKG lead captured 90 BPM  DAY 3  IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION Clinical improvement in terms of language deficit, but electrographic discharges have not resolved although they are broader in morphology and more poorly defined as well as less  frequent   ----------------------------------------------------------------- DAY 4 (05/23/2016- 05/24/2016- 9 AM) MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA, TRILEPTAL, Solumedrol, IV IG , percocet, others BACKGROUND: No major changes, stage II sleep identifies less focal slowing and fewer epileptiform discharges GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change FOCAL SLOWING: No change PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): see below ; temporal wicket  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Occasional (1/hour to <1min) relatively simple left temporal sharp waves, left temporal periodic discharges, "BIRDS" Left temporal 10 seconds duration EVENTS:  Although no clinical seizures were noted, and the patient continued to demonstrate improving language, electrographic discharges of 45 seconds to 1 minute  in duration were characterized by rhythmic buildup of delta/beta frequency periodic activity from the left temporal region. These were decreasing in frequency and, in sleep were much less common, in contrast to earlier days of the recording See: 8:22 AM, 9:09 AM 10:18 AM EKG: A single EKG lead captured 90 BPM  DAY4   IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION Clinical improvement in terms of language deficit, but electrographic seizures  have not resolved although they are briefer in duration and more infrequent   The discharges has improved by the morning of the 24th  Final IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION Initial electrographic and clinical (see baseline) complex partial status epilepticus, improving clinically and to some extent electrographically but at discharge, the EEG remains abnormal with focal slowing.  Because the patient had been more than 24 hours without clinical events, and therapy had been initiated, EEG recording was terminated
