HISTORY:

26 y.o. female with no past history who has

been admitted following several seizures at work; now referred


for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.


MEDICATIONS: Keppra



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 systemwith T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




Most of the background consists of sleep.  The technologist

repeatedly tries to awaken the patient using verbal and tactile


stimulation.  During brief periods of wakefulness, the background

is mildly disorganized with a mixture of alpha and beta


frequencies and fragments of a posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10

Hz.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a mildly abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to


(1) inability to sustain a wakeful state and (2) mild

disorganization of background.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of a mild diffuse cerebral

dysfunction; in this clinical scenario, these findings could be

consistent with a post-ictal state.
