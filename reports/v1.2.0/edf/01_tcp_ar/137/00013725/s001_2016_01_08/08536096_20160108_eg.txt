History:	62 year old woman who presents with episodes concerning for focal seizures.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Slow alpha variant is captured.  The expected AP gradient is 
poor.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
	Disorganization, mild
	No focal slowing or epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a mildly abnormal portable 21-minute EEG due to mild background disorganization. This 
finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No 
epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, 
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
