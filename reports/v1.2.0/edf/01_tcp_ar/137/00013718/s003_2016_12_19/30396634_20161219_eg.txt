SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse very low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.




There is an asymmetry in amplitude with a slightly more attenuated activity on the right hemisphere.


Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

There is no change in the background activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Severe generalized slow waves

2. Right hemisphere attenuation



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal coma routine EEG due to attenuation in the right hemisphere.  This finding is
indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin.


In addition there is severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
