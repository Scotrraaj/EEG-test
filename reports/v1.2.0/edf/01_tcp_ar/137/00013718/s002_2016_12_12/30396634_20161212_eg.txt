HISTORY: 65 y.o. MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O ACUTE ONSET OF LT HEMIPARESIS, CT SHOWS RT ICA. PT NOTED WITH RT EYE DEVIATION.  FOLLOW UP EEG PT HAD RESP ARREST 3 AM NOT DOWN LONG HAD CPR.  PT NOT RESPONSIVE. WAS PRIOR.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: cefazolin (ANCEF) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB MB+ carvedilol (COREG) tablet 6.25 mg potassium chloride (KAYCIEL) 20 mEq/15 mL solution 40 mEq vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+ digoxin (LANOXIN) tablet 0.25 mg heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units acetaminophen (TYLENOL) oral solution 650 mg docusate sodium (COLACE) liquid 100 mg Bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) suppository 10 mg clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 20 Units dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg insulin regular (Humulin R, Novolin R) injection 1-5 Units pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  EEG BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Some attenuation of faster frequencies is noted over the right hemisphere.  Sleep is not captured  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:   There is some reactivity to visual, auditory and tactile stimuli.       Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.       Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.   EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: 1. Right hemisphere attenuation  2. Moderate to severe diffuse slow waves  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to right hemisphere attenuation which is indicative of a right hemisphere cortical structural lesion. In addition, there is moderate to severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
