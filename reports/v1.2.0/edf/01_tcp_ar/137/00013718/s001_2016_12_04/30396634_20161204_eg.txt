SEDATION: versed and propofol


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.



There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.



The background during the periods of arousals over the left consists of a mixture of attenuated theta
and delta activity and triphasics waveforms.  Delta activity is most pronounced anteriorly.



The background during the periods of arousals over the right consists of primarily delta activity and
blunted triphasics waveforms.  There is more pronounced background attenuation over the right.



No normal sleep architecture is observed but periods of quiescence occur.  During those periods the
background is replaced by diffuse frontally predominant 7-8 Hz polymorphic theta activity.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


An irregular heart rate of ~120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate to severe background slowing

2. Continuous focal right hemispheric slowing and voltage attenuation


3. Continuous triphasics waveforms that are present during periods of stimulation.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.


Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the right and is consistent with
a known right MCA stroke.

Triphasic waves are a nonspecific EEG finding that can be seen in encephalopathy (mostly
commonly hepatic), uremia, anoxia and many other etiologies.




There is cardiac arrythmia.
