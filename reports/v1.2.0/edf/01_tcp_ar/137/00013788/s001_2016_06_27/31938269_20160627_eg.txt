DATE OF STUDY: 06/27/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep

HISTORY:

 a 41 y.o. WOMAN WITH CC OF LOC X2.  SECOND ASSOCIATED WITH LUE
SHAKING AND URINARY INCONTINENCE.  PT HAD SIMILAR EPISODES IN .



MEDICATIONS:


XANAX, HEPARIN, LIPITOR




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




However there is an excess of 5-7 hz discharges seen in wakefulness.


Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Mild excess theta and disorganization in wakefulness


2. Excess beta


CLINICAL CORRELATION:






This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing and
disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.




Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
