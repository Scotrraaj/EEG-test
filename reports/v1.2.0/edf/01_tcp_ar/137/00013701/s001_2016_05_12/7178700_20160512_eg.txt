DATE OF STUDY: 05/12/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient

EEG TYPE: 60 min - 3 hr, awake and asleep




HISTORY:


a 58 y.o. male with a history of aching muscles and tremor of the head for one
week referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

simvastatin (ZOCOR) 40 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET (40 MG) BY MOUTH DAILY IN THE EVENING


acetaminophen-codeine (TYLENOL #4) 300-60 mg per tablet,

diazepam (VALIUM) 2 mg tablet,

levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN) 500 mg tablet,


doxycycline (VIBRAMYCIN) 100 mg capsule,

lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide (PRINZIDE,ZESTORETIC) 20-12.5 mg per tablet,

simvastatin (ZOCOR) 20 mg tablet,


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:





A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  This is a low-voltage, awake background




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  The patient transitions in and out of
drowsiness on multiple occasions with various patterns including an increase in background slowing,
slowing of the alpha rhythm or an increase in beta.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

RMTD



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 50 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  Low voltage background and rhythmic MID
temporal theta of drowsiness are both normal findings


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
