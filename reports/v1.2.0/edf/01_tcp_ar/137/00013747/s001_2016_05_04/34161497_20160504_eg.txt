HISTORY:

60 y.o. WOMAN WITH PMHX OF SEIZURES, CVA X3, HLD.  CC OF LEFT
FACIAL DROOP, VOMITING.  TODAY ON 6 TH FLOOR HAD SEIZURE X 1 HR.  NOW ROUTINE AND
LTM


MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA, ATIVAN TOTAL 6 MG.



SEDATION: as above



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse very low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
There is intermixed alpha and beta fronto central bursts (spindle like) seen best over the left and
attenuated over the right hemisphere.





There is some muscle reactivity with stimulation but no clear background changes.



Sleep is not captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Generalized slow waves,  Severe.


2. Attenuation of faster frequencies over the right fronto central region.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal EEG due to attenuation of faster frequencies over the right fronto central region
which is indicative of a cortical structural lesion over that region or alternatively a fluid collection
over that region. In addition there is severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
