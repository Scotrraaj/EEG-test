HISTORY:

57 y.o. female with a history of change in mental status.




MEDICATIONS:


No AEDs listed





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a low amplitude polymorphic up to 8 Hz
fragmented theta activity posteriorly with preserved AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient and diffuse
polymorphic theta activity and underriding slow delta activity.




During very drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 71 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Mild-Moderate diffuse slowing


2. No stage II sleep

3. No epileptiform discharges




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and very briefly rowsy  routine EEG due to:


Mild- Moderate diffuse slowing.


This finding is indicative of mild-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.
