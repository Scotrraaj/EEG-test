HISTORY:

57 y.o. female who was transferred from an outside hospital, referred for routine
EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS: lasix, lantus, ISS, Levothyroxine



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically unsatisfactory
record due to diffuse muscle artifact obscuring all cerebral leads; the study also included a single
channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is entirely uninterpretable due to diffuse high amplitude muscle artifact obscuring
all leads despite the technician re-checking all connections.  The ordering team was notified about
this artifact and canceled the study.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Unable to interpret



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Unable to interpret


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical events captured during the study.

Presence of electrographic events cannot be interpreted due to muscle artifact.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION / CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an uninterpretable 12 min 10 sec EEG. Cerebral rhythms were entirely obscured by diffuse
high amplitude muscle artifact.
