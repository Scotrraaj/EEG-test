SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



There are subtle voltage and frequency asymmetry over the left centroparietal region that is apparent
during drowsiness and sleep.  This asymmetry is characterized by higher voltages and additional
underriding fast activity over the left centroparietal region.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) low to moderate amplitude spikes and polyspikes are captured over the
left temporal- centroparietal region (T5/ C3/ P3 max) during drowsiness and sleep


Rare right temporoparietal ((T4/P4 max) low amplitude spikes and polyspikes are captured during
drowsiness and sleep.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):




None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with fair cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep 1 hour routine EEG due to:

1. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) low to moderate amplitude spikes and polyspikes are captured over
the left temporal- centroparietal region (T5/ C3/ P3 max) during drowsiness and sleep


2. Rare right temporoparietal ((T4/P4 max) low amplitude spikes and polyspikes are captured during
drowsiness and sleep.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate 2 independent potentially epileptogenic foci:  left temporal- centroparietal
region and right temporoparietal region.
