HISTORY: 48 y.o. female with a history of IDDM, HLD who collapsed at the physician's office and was found in PEA arrest, requiring cardiac pump, referred for EEG as part of hypothermia protocol.  MEDICATIONS: HEPARIN, DEXTROSE, PLAVIX, ASA, INSULIN, PROTONIX,MAGNESIUM SULFATE  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record due to prominent artifact, described below.  The study included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (3/17/2016, 13:17 - 3/18/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND:  The background is completely obscured by artifact from the patient's cardiac device.  At 13:23 the pump is paused for 5 seconds, revealing a suppressed background.  There is no clear reactivity, variability, or state change.  There is severe generalized slowing.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected   DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a technically limited, abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing, suppressed background, lack of reactivity  These findings are consistent with severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (3/18/2016, 06:00 - 3/18/2016, 12:36)  BACKGROUND: Essentially no change. Background is obscured by artifact from cardiac pump on this day, up until 12:34. At this time, the artifact resolves, and a suppressed background is noted.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  As on day 1, severe generalized slowing with suppressed background and lack of cerebral activity. When cardiac pump artifact resolves, underlying cerebral rhythms are suppressed.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal, technically limited, long term video EEG due to:  1. Severe generalized slowing, suppressed background, lack of reactivity   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are consistent with severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
