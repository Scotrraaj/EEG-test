HISTORY:

57 y.o. female with a complaint of intermittent left facial numbness that can last
for hours, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) 17 gram/dose powder, Take 17 g by mouth daily.

fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray, 2 sprays by Each Nare route daily.

fluticasone-salmeterol (ADVAIR DISKUS) 100-50 mcg/dose diskus inhaler, Inhale 1 puff into the lungs
daily.


amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. (Patient taking differently:
Take 10 mg by mouth 2 times daily.)


omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 2 capsules by mouth every morning (before breakfast).

docusate sodium (COLACE) 100 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily as needed for
Constipation.

tiotropium (SPIRIVA) 18 mcg inhalation capsule, Inhale 18 mcg into the lungs daily.

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth daily.

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 20 mg tablet,


levothyroxine (SYNTHROID, LEVOTHROID) 125 mcg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


PROAIR HFA 90 mcg/actuation inhaler,



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
systemwith T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
