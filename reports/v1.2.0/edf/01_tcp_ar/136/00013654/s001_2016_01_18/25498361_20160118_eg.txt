HISTORY:

61 y.o. male FOUND CONFUSED, APHASIC.  PT

REMAINS AGITATED AND UNCOOPERATIVE. HAS REFUSED/MRI DOING EEG.


EVAL.


MEDICATIONS:


LIPITOR, HEPARIN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz

activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.

There is also excess beta seen.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG. Excessive beta

activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as

benzodiazepines or barbiturates.



A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
