2008. NOW WITH NOTED STARRING EPISODE/STROKE ALERT, EEG TO R/O SZ



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) tablet 10 mg


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 500 mg

sevelamer (RENAGEL) tablet 800 mg

heparin injection 1,000 Units



levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 250 mg



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record to
to muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


A posterior dominant rhythm was present at best 8hz. Background activity was characterized by
diffuse high voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.



Frontal intermittent delta activity (FIRDA) is seen.



Sleep is not captured but state changes can be seen.



As described above there is moderate generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:





1. Moderate generalized slow waves.

2. FIRDA



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to diffuse background slowing, FIRDA and
slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.


No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
