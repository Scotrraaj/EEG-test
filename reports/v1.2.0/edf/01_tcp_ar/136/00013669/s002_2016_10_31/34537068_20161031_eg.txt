HISTORY: 59 y.o. male for PTE.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: lactated ringers infusion cefuroxime (ZINACEF) 1.5 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+ sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL [START ON 11/1/2016] docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg [START ON 11/1/2016] senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet chlorhexidine (PERIDEX) 0.12 % solution 15 mL multivitamin (THERA) tablet 1 tablet ferrous sulfate tablet 325 mg acetaminophen (TYLENOL) suppository 650 mg acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg oxycodone-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet 1 tablet morphine injection 2 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg insulin regular 100 units in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion Epinephrine (ADRENALIN) 2 mg in dextrose 5 % in water 250 mL infusion dexmedetomidine (PRECEDEX) 400 mcg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion cefuroxime (ZINACEF) 1.5 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+   SEDATION: INDUCTION:  VERSED, KETAMINE, FENTANYL, ROCURONIUM..,..  ISOFLURANE  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   INCISION:  8:37AM CIRRC ARREST: 10:12AM--10:43AM OFF CIRRC ARRT: 10:31AM--11:01AM CARDIAC ARREST: COOLING: 9:09AM SUPPRESSED 10:02AM WARMING:11:01AM   EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   As the patient is sedated and cooled the EEG progressively becomes symmetrically diffusely slow and later attenuated. Once the EEG became isoelectric this was communicated to the team. Pt was then rewarmed and the EEG slowly revealed diffuse slowing that improved to faster frequencies symmetrically to a diffuse delta with superimposed beta background.   Sleep is not captured   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is a normal routine EEG and an uneventful PTE.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an uneventful EEG monitoring during PTE surgery.
