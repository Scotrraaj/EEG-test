HISTORY:

39 y.o. MAN WITH  H/O ENCEPHALITIS AGE 2,  SZS SINCE AGE 15. APPROX
1-2 A MONTH NOCTURNAL GTC.  PT WITH LEFT SIDE SKULL DEFECT BUT NO INFORMATION.



MEDICATIONS:

DEPAKOTE




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region with associated
increased amplitude and faster frequencies consistent with a breach pattern.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional left prefrontal frontal and right prefrontal sharp waves are seen. Some with a large field.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and
accentuates the  focal slowing in the left mid-temporal region



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



1. Bilateral pre frontal sharp waves

2. Continuous left mid-temporal focal slowing an breach




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to bilateral pre frontal sharp waves. These
findings indicate the presence of potentially epileptogenic foci in those regions.  In addition there is
continuous focal slowing in the left mid-temporal focal slowing an breach region.  This finding is
indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin.
