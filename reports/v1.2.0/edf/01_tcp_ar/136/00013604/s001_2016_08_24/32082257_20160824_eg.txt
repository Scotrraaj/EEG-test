HISTORY:

42 y.o. female with a history of premature birth, developmental
delay, ADD, chronic headaches with occasional visual hallucination of blue dots, referred for routine
EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) 25 mcg tablet, Take 25 mcg by mouth daily.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


Wakefulness is characterized by well-developed, symmetric and reactive, medium to high amplitude
9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
