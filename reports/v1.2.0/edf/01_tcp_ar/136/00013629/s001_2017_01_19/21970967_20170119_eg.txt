DATE OF STUDY: 01/19/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

 a 70 y.o. FEMALE WITH H/O MULTIPLE MYELOMA. PMHX. COPD, PAD, SP
TAVR, AORTIC VALVE DISORDER, ASTHMA, DM, COLON CA



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

potassium chloride IVPB 20 mEq 100 mL

acyclovir (ZOVIRAX) suspension 400 mg


sodium chloride 0.45 % infusion

hydrocortisone sod succ (PF) (Solu-CORTEF) injection 100 mg

ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) 400 mg in dextrose 5% 200 mL IVPB


calcium-vitamin D 500 mg(1,250mg) -200 unit per tablet 1 tablet

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 2-10 Units

rifAXIMin (XIFAXAN) tablet 550 mg


calcium acetate (PHOSLO) tablet 667 mg

lactulose (CHRONULAC) solution 30 g



pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg

albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 5 mg


ipratropium (ATROVENT) 0.02 % nebulizer solution 0.5 mg

cyanocobalamin tablet 1,000 mcg


levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 100 mcg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) EC tablet 5 mg

fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray 2 spray


montelukast (SINGULAIR) tablet 10 mg

dextrose 50% injection 25 mL


dextrose 50% injection 50 mL

glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
theta  frequencies, with an absent posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior
gradient can be seen with some central alpha.




Sleep is not captured.



Mild-moderate generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1. Mild to moderate generalized slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to mild to moderatendiffuse background
slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
