DATE OF STUDY: 09/05/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep



HISTORY:

a 32 y.o. male with a history of GSW to cranium, s/p craniectomy, possible sz on
9/3 referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

divalproex (DEPAKOTE DR) tablet 500 mg

oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet 1 tablet


oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet 2 tablet

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

famotidine (PEPCID) tablet 20 mg


docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg

senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet

sodium phosphates (FLEET) enema 1 enema


magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL

alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL



multivitamin (THERAPEUTIC-M) 9 mg iron-400 mcg per tablet 1 tablet

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


phenol (CHLORASEPTIC) 1.4 % spray 1 spray

tetanus,diphth,pertus(acell) (BOOSTRIX) injection 0.5 mL


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There is an
asymmetry and activity is attenuated on the left




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. Bursts of shifting slowing were seen, with
1-2 bursts FIRDA.




Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

Left  focal slowing is present. intermittent



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal  A, D stat portable EEG due to:


1. L sided focal slowing and attenuation in context of breach rhythm



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with left hemispheric insult
