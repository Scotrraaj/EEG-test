HISTORY:

57 y.o. FEMALE PRESENTS FOUND DOWN;

PULSLESS. DURATION UNKOWN (MAYBE 20 MIN). CPR WAS STARTED, 1 MG


OF EPI GIVEN AND SPONTANEOUS CIRCULATION RETURNED. PT WAS GIVEN

NARCAN. COCAINE / HEROIN ABUSE. HEP B/C.



EEG TO RULE OUT CONT. SZ.


MEDICATIONS:


VPA


SEDATION: Propofol



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a




NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized severe diffuse attenuation

with intermittent bursts. The bursts occur at 1:5 ratio and

consist of diffuse frontal predominant sharply contoured theta

followed by diffuse delta lasting from 1 -3 seconds with no


evolution. Some of this bursts have a clinical correlate with

patient exhibiting lower extremity twitching.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

See above.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Frontal predominant discharges

2. Cortical myoclonus

3. Burst suppresion



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal EEG due to diffuse frontal predominant

discharges with associated lower extremity movements consistent


with cortical myoclonus. In addition there is evidence severe

diffuse cerebral dysfunction which may be due at least in part to


medication effects. The overall findings in the setting of

hypoxia are suggestive of a poor prognosis.
