HISTORY:

67 y.o. MALE WITH A HX OF SZ, P/W NOCTURNAL

SZ. ? MEDICATION COMPLIANCE FOLLOW UP EEG FROM 3/20/2016. PT HAS


A VP SHUNT ON RIGHT SIDE FOR HYDROCEPHALUS




MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA, NORVASC, LISINOPRIL, PRAVASTATIN




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically




satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity

with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges at 0.5 Hz are seen

at F8 with a field that at times spreads to Fp2.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Right frontal PLEDs

2. Moderate to severe diffuse slow.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings right frontal PLEDs indicate the presence of a

irritable region and are suggestive of a highly epileptogenic


focus in that region. The moderate to severe diffuse background

slowing and absent alpha rhythm are etiologically nonspecific


indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

No seizure were seen.
