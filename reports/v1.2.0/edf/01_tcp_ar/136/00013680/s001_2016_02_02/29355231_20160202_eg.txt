HISTORY:

34 y.o. FEMALE R HANDED WITH SEIZURES SINCE

AGE  27. HAS NO AURA, +LOC, +SHAKING, ALONG WITH  STRETCHING AND


MOANING FOR 2 TO 3 MINUTES DURING SLEEP.THIS IS WITNESSED BY

BOYFRIEND. AFTERWARDS SHE HAS A HEADACHE ALL OVER HEAD.



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is seen at F7/T3 and

wakefulness and drowsiness.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Occasional spikes are seen at F7/T3 in wakefulness and

drowsiness.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness noted over the left

temporal region.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces focal slowing in the

left anterior temporal region



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Focal spikes waves seen occasionally in the left anterior


temporal region

2. Focal slowing seen intermittently in the left anterior

temporal region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to


occasional left anterior temporal spikes and focal slowing. This

findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in

this region. No seizures were seen.
