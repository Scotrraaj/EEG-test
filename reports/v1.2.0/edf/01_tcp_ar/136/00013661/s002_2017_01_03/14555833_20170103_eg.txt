HISTORY:

49 y.o. female with a history of CVA w/ R hemiparesis, DM, and ESRD on
HD who became confused during dialysis today and was noted to have a left gaze preference. She
has not yet returned to her baseline, though husband reports she has improved somewhat. She is now
referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized mixture of alpha and
beta frequencies, with excess theta and delta slowing. There are fragments of a ~8 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR), seen better on the right. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of
frequency and amplitude is present, but suboptimal.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild-moderate generalized slowing is present.

Continuous attenuation of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere is noted.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild-moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Continuous attenuation of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of left hemispheric dysfunction, likely affecting the cortex, and
structural in nature, which should be correlated with imaging.

There is additionally evidence for a mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.


Following this study the patient was continued on long term EEG monitoring.
