DATE OF STUDY: 08/24/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep




HISTORY:

a 35 y.o. male with a history of head trauma from baseball bat, subarachnoid
hemorrhage and staring spells, referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

HYDROmorphone (DILAUDID) injection 0.5 mg

HYDROmorphone (DILAUDID) injection 1 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg


levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg



docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg

senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet






SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel bedside electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 systemwith T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The patient was drowsy or asleep throughout the record. The tracing opens with the patient asleep,
with background demonstrating low amplitude generalized 1.5-4 Hz activity and frontal, central and
temporal sleep spindles. During brief arousal, muscle artifact and increased generalized beta activity
were seen.




No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal drowsy and asleep bedside EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.
