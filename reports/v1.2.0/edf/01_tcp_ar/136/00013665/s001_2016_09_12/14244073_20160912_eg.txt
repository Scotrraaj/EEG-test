DATE OF STUDY: 09/12/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 78 y.o. male with a history of prior CVA, presenting with acute CVA like
symptoms and seizure referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


hydralazine (APRESOLINE) tablet 100 mg

labetalol (NORMODYNE) tablet 300 mg

amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg


escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) tablet 10 mg

QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) tablet 25 mg

sodium citrate-citric acid (BICITRA) solution 15 mL


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

aspirin (BAYER) tablet 325 mg

heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units


niCARdipine (CARDENE) 20 mg in NaCl (iso-os) 200 mL infusion

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 250 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB







SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by low voltage pattern  presence of a well organized
symmetric mixture of theta and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 6 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present.  Generous frontal beta is noted.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


Mild  generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 104 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild slowing -including slow alpha rhythm





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are non-specific but support mild disturbance of cerebral function.  No epileptiform
features were seen.
