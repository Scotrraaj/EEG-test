History:		61 Y/0 MALE ADMITTED FOR RIGH AVM CEREBELLAR RUPTURE WITH LOC AND WITNESSED SZ.. PT IS UNRESPONSIVE
Medications:	ZOSYN, METOPROOL, KEPPRA, LISINOPRIL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose

Description:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No normal sleep architecture was present.
Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right temporal (with a varying field at times more anterior) region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. Hr was 96bps
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, left temporal Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of nearly continuous focal slowing in the left temporal region. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition, there is moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
