SEDATION: None

TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  Somewhat technically difficult record,

with diffuse muscle artifact obscuring both temporal chains for


the majority of the study. It included a single channel of EKG

and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured




No generalized slowing is present.


There is occasional mild bilateral central polymorphic slowing.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:




Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is a somewhat technically limited (evaluation of temporal

chains difficult due to muscle artifact) abnormal awake only


routine EEG due to:

1. Occasional mild bilateral central polymorphic slowing




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of

bilateral central cerebral dysfunction.
