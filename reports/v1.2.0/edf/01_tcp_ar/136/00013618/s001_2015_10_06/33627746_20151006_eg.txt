HISTORY: 89 y.o. male with a history of extensive PMH, now presents with decreased responsiveness, concerning for seizures.  MEDICATIONS: No AEDs   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, and consists predominantly of a mixture of diffuse polymorphic low to moderate amplitude theta, delta activity and abundant triphasic waveforms.   Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, and sleep spindles.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured heart rate of ~ 100 bpm.  DAY IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal ~19 hour long term video EEG due to: (1) moderate diffuse slowing (2) abundant triphasic  These findings are indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of toxic metabolic in etiology.  Triphasic waves are a nonspecific EEG finding that can be seen in encephalopathy (mostly commonly hepatic), uremia, anoxia and many other etiologies.
