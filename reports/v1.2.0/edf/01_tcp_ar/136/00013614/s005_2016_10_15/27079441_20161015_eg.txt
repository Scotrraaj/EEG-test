No additional clinical information was provided but the intermittent attenuation should be correlated with medicines.  FINAL IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. Overall the background was improving by the end. Transient attenuations may be correlated with clinical factors including use of sedative medicines.
