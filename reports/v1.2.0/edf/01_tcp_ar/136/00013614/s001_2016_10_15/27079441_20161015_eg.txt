HISTORY:

35 y.o. male with a history of left parafalcine cystic mass representing abscess as


detailed on the MRI from 10/13/2016, now with R hemiparesis referred for routine EEG for
assessment of mental status change. The patient is somewhat responsive.

TECHNIQUE:


A STAT portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile, verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The  background is characterized by the presence of a nearly symmetric mixture of delta frequencies.
There are smaller amounts of alpha and theta and some variability in the record. The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is not present.





Marked generalized slowing is present.


Left hemispheric focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Stimulation produces brief increase in alpha and theta activity.


EVENTS:




There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized background, slowing


2. Replacement of normal background with delta, pattern, somewhat slower on the left



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are suggestive of a diffuse CNS disturbance with superimposed focal features. The
presence of reactivity and variability are positive features. No epileptiform features were noted. This
patient will go on to LTM
