HISTORY:

82 y.o. male with a history of HTN, HLD,

hypothyroidism, and reflux who presents with right sided


weakness, slurred speech, and impaired comprehension, referred

for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA, CEFTRIAXONE, ATIVAN (2MG 4AM ON 2/29)


SEDATION: meds as above



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is continuous but disorganized and consists of


mostly delta and theta frequencies with admixed occasional alpha

and beta.  There is no clear reactivity to noxious stimulation or


passive eye opening.  There is no clear variability or state

change.  There is frequent diffuse tonic muscle artifact for

periods of 15 seconds, obscuring the underlying background,

during which the tech notes the patient


tenses his facial muscles, moves his legs, and/or sighs; no

additional movements are seen on video review.



There is severe generalized slowing.

There is no definite focal slowing or attenuation of faster

frequencies.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing and disorganization, without clear


reactivity, variability, or state change



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral


dysfunction.
