HISTORY: 49 y.o. male with a history of witnessed cardiac arrest last night, now in hypothermia protocol referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures/ hypothermia protocol.  Pt has myoclonus and has been cooled to 32 degrees. CT of brain with early anoxic changes. BP 103/68  Pulse 81  Temp (!) 90.1 °F (32.3 °C)  Resp 14  Ht 1.829 m (6')  Wt 100.1 kg (220 lb 10.9 oz)  SpO2 95%  PF 60 L/min  BMI 29.93 kg/m2  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: vecuronium (NORCURON) 10 mg injection Dopamine (INTROPIN) 400 mg/250 mL (1,600 mcg/mL) in D5W infusion Lorazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units Propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion Propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB  TECHNIQUE: A  Bedside 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, use of vecuronium and tactile stimulation.  DAY 1 (9/3/2016, 14:00-09/04/216)  BACKGROUND: The patient was rewarmed during this section.  He was treated with maximal doses of Propofol and then midazolam was added because of clinical jerking.  The nurses briefly dislodged the EEG electrodes.   The  background is discontinuous, with a burst suppression pattern, with periods of suppression typically 6-10  Seconds duration and relatively symmetric bursts of high amplitude, chaotic, mixed frequency sharply contoured activity, noted in 2-4 second bursts, at times a few bursts spanning ten seconds.  The background is not reactive,  EVENTS: use of vecuronium blocked shiver and myoclonus  EKG: A single lead captured HR 81 BPM  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Burst suppression pattern, noted despite use of Propofol.   Over time, with re-warming, the periods of suppression were only 1-3 seconds and the high amplitude bursts were more sustained, typically as several bursts in sequence.  This is a worrisome finding following cardiac arrest.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (09/04/2016, 06:00 - 9/5/2016, 06:00) Current Facility-Administered Medications: norepinephrine in NSS (LEVOPHED) 8 mg/250 mL (32 mcg/mL) infusion Soln, , , ,  norepinephrine (LEVOPHED) 8 mg/250 mL (32 mcg/mL) in D5W infusion, 4-30 mcg/min, Intravenous, Titrated  Lorazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg, 2 mg, Intravenous, Once, 2 mg at 09/03/16 0328 midazolam (VERSED) 50 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL infusion, 0.5-14 mg/hr, Intravenous, Titrated, Last Rate: 4 mL/hr at 09/04/16 2000, 4 mg/hr at 09/04/16 2000 Propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion, 5-80 mcg/kg/min, Intravenous, Titrated, Last Rate: 48 mL/hr at 09/03/16 1943, 80 mcg/kg/min at 09/03/16 1943 Propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion, 5-80 mcg/kg/min, Intravenous, Titrated, Last Rate: 24 mL/hr at 09/04/16 2000, 40 mcg/kg/min at 09/04/16 2000 levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB, 1,000 mg, Intravenous, Q12H SCH, Stopped at 09/04/16 1003 BP 138/81 (BP Location: Left arm)  Pulse 89  Temp 100.3 °F (37.9 °C)  Resp (!) 31  Ht 1.829 m (6' 0.01")  Wt 100.1 kg (220 lb 10.9 oz)  SpO2 97%  PF 75 L/min  BMI 29.93 kg/m2  BACKGROUND: transition from B-S pattern to a suppressed pattern , with a  Bifrontal GPED pattern, with some variability. Over time the discharges are slowing to isolated bursts, at 1.75-2.5 Hz to a simple morphology, at approx 1 Hz.  There is no reactivity GENERALIZED SLOWING: see above, by the end of the record there is a low voltage, slow, monotonous pattern.  FOCAL SLOWING: No change PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Abundant (>1/10s) see above EVENTS: myoclonic jerks EKG: A single EKG lead captured 90 BPM   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION    This is an ominous pattern following cardiac arrest and should be correlated with imaging and exam.  DAY 3 (09/05/2016, 06:00 - 9/6/2016, 09:00) Current Facility-Administered Medications: norepinephrine in NSS (LEVOPHED) 8 mg/250 mL (32 mcg/mL) infusion Soln,  norepinephrine (LEVOPHED) 8 mg/250 mL (32 mcg/mL) in D5W infusion, 4-30 mcg/min, I Lorazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg, 2 mg, Intravenous, Once, 2 mg at 09/03/16 0328 midazolam (VERSED) 50 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL infusion, 0.5-14 mg/hr, Intravenous, wean in progress levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB, 1,000 mg, Intravenous, Q12H SCH, Stopped at 09/04/16 1003   BACKGROUND: transition from B-S pattern to a suppressed pattern  with a  Bifrontal GPED pattern, with some variability. Over time the discharges are slowing to isolated bursts, at 1.75-2.5 Hz to a simple morphology, at approx 1 Hz.  This was followed by a theta pattern with intermittent independent lateralized discharges. There is no reactivity GENERALIZED SLOWING: see above, by the end of the record there is a diffuse theta monotonous pattern followed by a low voltage relatively suppressed pattern.  FOCAL SLOWING: No change PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Abundant (>1/10s) GPD see above, noted prominently on the 5th,     Then transitioning to independent lateralized periodic discharges with periodicity of >1 second.  Waning by the end of the recording.  EVENTS: myoclonic jerks appear to have resolved.  Stimulation on the 5th did not induce myoclonus - see 10:39 AM  EKG: A single EKG lead captured 90 BPM   DAY  3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION This is a worrisome pattern following cardiac arrest and should be correlated with imaging and exam. Periodic complexes seem to have faded away, but the monotonous theta pattern has transitioned to a lower voltage suppressed pattern.  OVERALL  IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION The patterns described above congruent with the natural progression in severe anoxic insult and therapeutic hypothermia, with initially suppressed pattern, followed by periodic complexes which wane. The absence of reactivity and the increasingly invariant pattern is also supportive of a severe insult.
