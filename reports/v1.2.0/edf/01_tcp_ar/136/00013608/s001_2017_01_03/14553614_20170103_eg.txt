DATE OF STUDY: 01/03/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

 a 25 y.o. male with a history of HTN emergency and likely PRES resulting in
seizures, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background consists almost entirely of generalized rhythmic delta activity at 2-2.5 Hz
which does not evolve. There are brief admixed periods of resolution of this activity, revealing a
disorganized background consisting of theta and beta with shifting delta slowing, without a clear
posterior dominant rhythm.




Clear drowsy and sleep states are not captured. Background is variable.



Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present.

No sustained focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and disorganization

2. Near continuous 2-2.5 Hz generalized rhythmic delta activity




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a moderate to severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.


Generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA) is a nonspecific but pathologic finding that is most
commonly seen in toxic-metabolic states, but may also be seen with deep structural lesions or
increased intracranial pressure. Clinical correlation is advised.
