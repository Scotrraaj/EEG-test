HISTORY:

75 y.o. male with reported seizures, gamma knife

5/2015, and WBRT, who suffered a mechanical fall, referred for


EEG for characterization of seizures.


MEDICATIONS: no AEDs



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




Most of the record consists of drowsiness and sleep.



During brief periods of wakefulness, there is a fairly organized

mixture of alpha and theta frequencies, with a reactive 7 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) seen better on the left. The

normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude

is present but suboptimal.



Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by further background

slowing that is often asymmetric, with delta and theta on the


left, and a more attenuated mixture of alpha, theta and delta on

the right. There are no well formed sleep transients captured.


Mild generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Asymmetric background changes in drowsiness and sleep as

described above



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of

shifting hemispheric dysfunction superimposed on mild diffuse


cerebral dysfunction.
