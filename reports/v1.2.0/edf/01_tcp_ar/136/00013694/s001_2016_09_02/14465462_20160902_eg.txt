HISTORY:

64 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O A-FIB, SYNCOPE, NOTED WITH CONVULSIVE
SYNCOPE



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

aspirin EC tablet 81 mg

B complex-vitamin C-folic acid (NEPHROCAPS) 1 mg capsule 1 capsule


calcium acetate (PHOSLO) tablet 667 mg

heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

ferrous sulfate tablet 325 mg


docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The limited waking background is characterized by the presence of a low amplitude of alpha and
beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The
normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Excess theta is seen in
wakefulness.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



The record is mainly in sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and
symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 126 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Excessive theta in wakfulness





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal mainly drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing
and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction. The patient was asleep almost the entire record despite stimulation, in the
absence of sedation this may be indicative of a sleep disorder. No seizures or epileptiform activity
was seen.
