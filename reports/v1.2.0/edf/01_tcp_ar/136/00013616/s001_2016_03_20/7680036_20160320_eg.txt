HISTORY:

64 y.o. male with a history of NSTEMI, nausea,

vomtiing, and pneumonia referred for routine EEG for assessment


of mental status change; patient was found to have left gaze

deviation and fluctuating mental status on exam.



MEDICATIONS: Plavix, Theragan, Ceftriaxone, METOPROLOL,

ATROVASTATIN, PHENERGAN , ATIVAN 1MG 705 AM 3/20, KEPPRA




SEDATION: as above



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically




satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The record consists only of sleep despite stimulation and passive


eye opening/closure by the technician.

Sleep is characterized by synchronous vertex waves and spindles

that are attenuated on the right.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Attenuation of sleep transients over the right hemisphere


2. Lack of wakeful background rhythm despite stimulation.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings demonstrate right hemisphere cortical dysfunction


superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
