HISTORY:

64 y.o.MAN PRESENTS FOR FOLLOW UP AMITEED ON

3/19 WITH DX OF ISCHEMIC STROKE PRIOR EEG TO R/O SZ.



MEDICATIONS:



NO AED


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


A posterior dominant rhythm that at best reached 7Hz was present.

Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta more than


delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior

gradient of frequencies. The backgrourd is variable and reactive.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles. Slow wave

sleep was not captured.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate diffuse slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to diffuse

background slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific


indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
