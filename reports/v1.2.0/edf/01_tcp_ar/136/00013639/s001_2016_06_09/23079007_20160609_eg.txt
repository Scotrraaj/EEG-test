HISTORY:

52 y.o. male with a history of first ever seizure.  His girlfriend attributes it to
PCP ingestion, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


None listed




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The patient is exceptionally drowsy and the entire EEG is essentially sleep



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  Beta spindles and posts are
noted.  Prominent snore artifact was demonstrated.



Tactile stimulation of the patient produces a brief arousal and the patient drifts back to sleep



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: see above

EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of  55bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal asleep only routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal asleep only routine EEG.  Clinical features may be explored to determine why this
patient is so sleepy

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
