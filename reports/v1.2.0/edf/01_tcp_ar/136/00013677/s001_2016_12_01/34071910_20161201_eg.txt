HISTORY:
59 y.o. male with a history of *CVA, HIV, fell while drunk, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 2.5 mg aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 20 mg thiamine (B-1) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (BACTRIM DS) 800-160 mg per tablet 1 tablet predniSONE (DELTASONE) tablet 40 mg albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 5 mg ipratropium (ATROVENT) 0.02 % nebulizer solution 0.5 mg azithromycin (ZITHROMAX) tablet 250 mg oxazepam (SERAX) capsule 30 mg   Followed by [START ON 12/2/2016] oxazepam (SERAX) capsule 30 mg   Followed by [START ON 12/3/2016] oxazepam (SERAX) capsule 30 mg LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 5 mg    SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation. Patient was very drowsy  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Sweat or head rocking artifact is seen in the right>left occipital region  During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep includes some spindles No generalized slowing is present.  Occasional shifting focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.       EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an unremarkable  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected. The shifting slowing may be correlated with imaging.  The patient seems to be very sleepy CLINICAL CORRELATION: This routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
