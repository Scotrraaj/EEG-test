SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKGand photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
theta and delta frequencies, with at times a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that reaches 8 Hertz .



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Diffuse frontal Intermittent rhythmic activity (FIRDA) is seen for seconds.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Moderate diffuse slow waves and FIRDA



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to diffuse background slowing and slow alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.

No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
