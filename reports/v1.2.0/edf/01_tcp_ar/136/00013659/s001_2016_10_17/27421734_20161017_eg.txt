SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically very limited in the
temporal regions due to severe myogenic artifact and included a single channel of EKG and photic
stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background can not be well described but no clear posterior dominant rhythm is noted and there
appears to be diffuse slow waves in the central region.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Appears to be irregular.


IMPRESSION:


1. This EEG is very limited and no definitive conclusion can be made.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Please note that due to the severe muscle artifact no conclusions can be made. A repeat study with
sedation may be done if clinically necessary.


Irregular HR is noted on a single lead EKG.
