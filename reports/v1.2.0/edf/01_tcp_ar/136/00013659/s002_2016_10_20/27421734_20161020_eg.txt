HISTORY:

79 y.o. female with a history of breast cancer, UTI, left sided weakness with negative
CT referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  Some electrode problems
noted in record including T2 artifact.



BP 104/62 (BP Location: Left arm, Patient Position: Lying)  Pulse (!) 124  Temp 99.3 F (37.4 C)
(Axillary)  Resp 20  Ht 5' 7.99" (1.727 m)  Wt 236 lb 12.4 oz (107.4 kg)  SpO2 94%


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by diffusely slow pattern of theta with 6 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present. Intermittently the activity in the right posterior quadrant is of lower voltage.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is symmetric with vertex waves.



Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present.

No definitve focal slowing is present.  Attenuation noted on the right may be artifact.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Occasional bihemispheric paroxysmal frontal delta is noted during drowsiness and wakefulness.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Generalized background slowing

2. FIRDA



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific but can be seen in metabolic encephalopathy or other diffuse
disturbances.  Given the artifacts in this record, the focal features on the right are of unclear clinical
significance.
