HISTORY:

58 y.o. male with a history of syncope referred for routine EEG for evaluation of
paroxysmal events and characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A STAT portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (E EG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG*


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

Infrequent intermittent L>R temporal  focal slowing is present., characterized by isolated theta/delta



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Occasional wicket waves are noted during drowsiness over the  Right or left temporal  Regions,
sometimes seen with the focal slowing in early drowsy.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a very mildly  abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Temporal slowing greater than accepted for adult of this age.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with ischemic cerebral vascular disease in subjects
of this age.
