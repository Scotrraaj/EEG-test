HISTORY: 58 y.o. male with a history of 6 syncopal spells, chest pain referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events. Pt was walking on the street when he began to experience palpitations with accompanied 9/10 chest pain followed by LOC and fall. This is his sixth episode of the same semiology in past 2 months- heart races, feels "dizzy", has LOC for 3-5min, then wakes up and "thinks he's in West Virginia", but returns to normal after a few minutes.   He has had an extensive cardiac workup. He had a loop recorder implanted on 9/26; interrogation on 10/10 showed no arrhythmias. He had a CTA on 9/11 that was negative for PE and Dopplers on 10/10 that were negative for DVT; he was noted to be persistently tachycardic on previous admissions.   MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: oxyCODONE (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 30 mg metoprolol tartrate (LOPRESSOR) tablet 25 mg allopurinol (ZYLOPRIM) tablet 300 mg aspirin (BAYER) tablet 325 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg cyanocobalamin tablet 1,000 mcg ferrous sulfate tablet 325 mg folic acid (FOLVITE) tablet 1 mg gabapentin (NEURONTIN) tablet 600 mg isosorbide dinitrate (ISORDIL) tablet 10 mg nitroGLYCERIN (NITROSTAT) SL tablet 0.4 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg PARoxetine (PAXIL) tablet 40 mg ranolazine (RANEXA) 12 hr tablet 500 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg  SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE: A continuous videon21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and seizure and spike detection  DAY 1 ( - 10/15/2016,  12:00- 10/16/2016) BP 105/75 (BP Location: Right arm, Patient Position: Lying)  Pulse 96  Temp 97 °F (36.1 °C) (Oral)  Resp 20  Ht 1.727 m (5' 8")  Wt 87.1 kg (192 lb)  SpO2 100%  BMI 29.19 kg/m2  BACKGROUND: The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of alpha with admixed frontocentral beta. Posterior dominant rhythm was present. The background is  reactive,  variable. There were  no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency, outside of the range of normal for age.  Temporal slowing of the elderly was noted, L>R Sleep was limited. Vertex, spindles. Sleep is disrupted, there are bursts of shifting attenuations for < 3 seconds.   PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  wicket  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  none  EVENTS: none  EKG: A single lead captured 90-100 BPM  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Shifting temporal slowing, somewhat out of the range of normal for an adult of this age.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (10/16/2016, 06:00) BP 121/77 (BP Location: Left arm, Patient Position: Lying)  Pulse 95  Temp 96.8 °F (36 °C) (Oral)  Resp 20  Ht 1.727 m (5' 8")  Wt 87.1 kg (192 lb)  SpO2 98%  BMI 29.19 kg/m2 Current Facility-Administered Medications: diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) capsule 25 mg oxyCODONE (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 30 mg metoprolol tartrate (LOPRESSOR) tablet 25 mg allopurinol (ZYLOPRIM) tablet 300 mg aspirin (BAYER) tablet 325 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg cyanocobalamin tablet 1,000 mcg ferrous sulfate tablet 325 mg folic acid (FOLVITE) tablet 1 mg gabapentin (NEURONTIN) tablet 600 mg isosorbide dinitrate (ISORDIL) tablet 10 mg nitroGLYCERIN (NITROSTAT) SL tablet 0.4 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg PARoxetine (PAXIL) tablet 40 mg ranolazine (RANEXA) 12 hr tablet 500 mg  BACKGROUND: No change, sleep is fragmented and deeper stages sleep not sustained.  Sleep is sharply contoured, and has shifting irregular bursts, particularly L posterior temporal  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change FOCAL SLOWING: No change PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected EKG: A single EKG lead captured 90 BPM  DAY2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No seizures, no epileptiform activity, but a sharply contoured pattern in drowsiness. Intermittent temporal slowing is a nonspecific finding in adults of this age group with cerebrovascular disease.   FINAL: IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION Abnormal- Abnormal background with temporal slowing and irregular sharply contoured sleep pattern, but no sharp waves nor spikes nor seizures.
