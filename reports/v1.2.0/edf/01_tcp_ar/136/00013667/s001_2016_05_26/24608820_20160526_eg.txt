HISTORY:

51 y.o. female with a history of spells of vertigo and depersonalization, DM,
HTN, HLD referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

mometasone (ASMANEX) 220 mcg (30 doses) inhaler, Inhale 1 puff into the lungs daily.

fluticasone (FLOVENT HFA) 110 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs 2 times daily.


albuterol (PROAIR HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every 4 hours as
needed for Wheezing.


ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 600 mg tablet,

montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth nightly.

Biotin 800 mcg Tablet, Take  by mouth.


FOLIC ACID PO, Take  by mouth.

multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

valsartan (DIOVAN) 160 mg tablet, Take 160 mg by mouth daily.




metFORMIN (GLUCOPHAGE) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.


SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Lambda is seen





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  Sleep is briefl



No generalized slowing is present.  In HV and drowsiness, there are brief or isolated Left or Right
temporal theta waves.  focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: produces bursts of slowing with some shifting slowing.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces scant
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a mildly abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG.


1. R or Left isolated temporal slowing in drowsiness or Hyperventilation

CLINICAL CORRELATION:


The findings described above are non-specific. They are commonly seen in older adults with
cerebrovascular disease. This is EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.



THIS IS A SECOND REPORT FOR THE MAY 26, 2016 STUDY.  THE ORIGINAL REPORT HAS NOT
BEEN RETRIEVED.
