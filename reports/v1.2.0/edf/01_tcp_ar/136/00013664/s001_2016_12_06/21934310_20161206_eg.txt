HISTORY:

50 y.o.FEMALE WITH PMHX OF SEIZURES  EVALUATION TO HAVE
DENTAL SURGERY.  LAST SZ 11/16. HAS APPROX 1-2 SZS A MONTH.  STATES HAS NOT BEEN
EVALUATED FOR YEARS.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet,

DILANTIN EXTENDED 100 mg ER capsule,

hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 25 mg tablet,



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness. At times this is sharply contoured.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study. At times sharply contoured.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:



1. Frequent  focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to frequent focal slowing in the left anterior
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific.
