HISTORY:

80 y.o. female with a history of left

frontal intracerebral hemorrhage, status post craniotomy referred


for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.


MEDICATIONS:


KEPPRA, DONEPEZIL, INSULIN, ATORVASTATIN, METFORMIN, VALSARTAN,

ISOSORBIDE, METOPROLOL, LEVOTHYROXINE, ALLOPURINAL, MONTELUKAST

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


tactile, auditory  stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The patient is somnolent throughout the EEG.  The background is

continuous, and mixed frequency activity with an asymmetry.  It


is low to medium amplitude delta with scant faster frequency

activity on the right.


On the left, there is a breach rhythm with accentuation of faster


frequency activity in the left frontal region.



Tactile stimulation produces an increase in faster frequency

activity which, in this case is theta, present bilaterally

Generalized slowing is present.

Left focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: see above



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 80 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:


1. generalized background slowing

2. Breach rhythm with accentuation of faster frequency activity


on the left

3. focal, left frontocentral delta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings supported bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral

function.  The focal features or congruent with imaging and


clinical history.  The presence of reactivity to stimulation is a

positive prognostic feature.
