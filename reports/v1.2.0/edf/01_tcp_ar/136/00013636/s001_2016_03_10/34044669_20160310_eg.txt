HISTORY:

49 y.o. male with a history of beer migraine

followed by convulsion referred for routine EEG for


characterization of seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

No current facility-administered medications documented by the

technologists



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically




challenging record and included a single channel of EKG and

auditory stimulation.  The patient was described as uncooperative


initially and tremulous throughout the record



EEG BACKGROUND:

The EEG is obscured by continuous muscle artifact.  There is a

glimpse of an awake background with 6 Hz theta in a 9 Hz alpha

rhythm.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, and slowing of the


alpha rhythm to 7 Hz was noted.  The muscle artifact persisted


Sleep is not captured



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1.  At least modest background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


The continuous muscle artifact precludes a complete assessment.

Subtle details may be lost.  The tremulousness and uncooperative


he was not associated with epileptiform activity.  If seizures

are an important consideration, a followup study the patient is

cooperative and suggested
