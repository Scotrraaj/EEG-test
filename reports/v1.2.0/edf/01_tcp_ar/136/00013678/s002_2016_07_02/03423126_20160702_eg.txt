START DATE OF STUDY: 07/02/16 at 11:04 END DATE OF STUDY: 07/03/16 at 08:00 Patient was disconnected after 10 hours.  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 66 y.o. WOMAN THAT WAS FOUND UNRESPONSIVE /SLUMPED OVER NOW WITH EPISODES OF EYE DEVIATION WITH POOR RESPONSIVENESS.  MEDICATIONS: ATIVAN, DEPAKOTE   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  DAY 1 (07/02/2016 11:04 - 7/03/2016, 08:00)  However record stopped at 21:27  EEG BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Continuous polymorphic delta activity andattenuation is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the midtemporal region.  During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep is not captured  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  Hyperventilation and photic Stimulation were not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  DAY 1 (only 10 hours) IMPRESSION: 1.  Continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere maximal in the midtemporal region and attenuation. 2.  Moderate diffuse background slowing   CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal awake and asleep 10hour EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere maximal in the midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin. In addition there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
