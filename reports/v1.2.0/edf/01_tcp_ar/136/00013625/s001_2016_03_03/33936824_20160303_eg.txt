HISTORY:

65 y.o. male with a history of Acute

infarction within the right internal frontal cortex a learning


aortic valve repair yesterday referred for routine EEG for

screening for subclinical seizures.

This patient had an episode of right gaze deviation followed by


left-sided weakness.

MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.


MORPHINE,CIPROFLOXACIN,VANCOMYCIN,FENTANYL,ATIVAN GIVEN 2:45 1 MG


3:30 4 MG,PANTOPRAZOLe


SEDATION: Ativan






TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable digital video 21 channel electroencephalogram


(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with

T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a


technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of

EKG and tactile  Stimulation.  Patient is responsive


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized a mixed frequency

background with generous theta, a glimpse of an alpha rhythm of


approximately 7 Hz, sometimes increasing to 8.5 Hz.  Laambda

waves are seen.

During brief  drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements,  diffuse

background slowing and an increase in beta are seen .   Shifting


slowing was noted



Generalized slowing is present.

Focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: See above


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. generalized background slowing


2. shifting arrhythmic delta activity, intermittently, more

remarkable in the right posterior quadrant.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings support a diffuse, bihemispheric disturbance.

There is intermittent focal slowing noted in the right

hemisphere.  Although the patient had a left frontal stroke, the

findings are little bit more prominent posteriorly.  There were


no epileptiform features noted.  This patient is awake, the EEG

is responsive and some of the typical normal morphologies of


wakefulness, such as alpha, are present.
