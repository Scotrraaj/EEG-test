History:	53 YO FEMALE SIP RECENT CRANIOTOMY (SCAR LEFT TO RIGHT EAR SLIGHTLY BEHIND CZ) FOR SECTION OF LEFT FRONTAL MENINIOMA. PRESENTS TO TUH FROM OSH WITH RIGHT LEG SHAKING. PMH: HTN
CTH: SMALL FOCUS OF ACUTE HEMMORRHAGE IN PROR SURG. SITE. Medications:	FOSPHENYTOIN AND DILANTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV,18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV,18-25Hz activity is also seen. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. Prominent POSTs are noted. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left central region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. Hr was 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left central
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left central region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. No clinical or electrographic seizures	present.
