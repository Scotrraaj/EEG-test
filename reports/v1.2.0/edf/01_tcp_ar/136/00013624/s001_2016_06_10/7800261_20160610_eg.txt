HISTORY:

81 y.o. female with a history of a recent stroke and episode of loss of
consciousness.



MEDICATIONS:


Fentanyl patch, no AEDs




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5-9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Patient remains awake throughout the recording.


Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the right anterior temporal region.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

An irregular heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Intermittent mild-to-moderate right anterior temporal focal slowing


2. Cardiac arrhythmia


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Intermittent focal slowing is suggestive of a focal structural lesion over the right anterior temporal
region.



An irregular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
