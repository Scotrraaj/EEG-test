DATE OF STUDY: 06/27/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 81 y.o. Woman p/w syncopal episode which lasted 3-4 hrs. The pt has a history
of CVA 





MEDICATIONS:

Metorpolol, Oxybutynin, Heparin, Gabapentin, Levothyroxine, Insulin, Clindamycin, Tylenol



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The limited waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a limited posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that rarely reaches 9Hz.
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




There is an excess of diffuse 5-7Hz discharges seen in limited wakefulness.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead with an abnormal rhythm noted.



IMPRESSION:

1. Excessive theta in wakefulness



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing and mild
disorganization   These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.








Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
