HISTORY:

19 y.o. MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O NEW

ONSET SZ JAN 2016, PT REPORTS 4 SZ IN FEB WITH THE LAST SZ X 2


DAYS AGO. SZ ARE WITH LOC, SHAKING AND POSTICTAL CONFUSION

LASTING 10-15 MIN. PT DENIES B/B INCONT, TONGUE BITING, AURA.



MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA INCERA TO 1000 MG 2 X A DAY



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. No epileptiform activity was seen.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.
