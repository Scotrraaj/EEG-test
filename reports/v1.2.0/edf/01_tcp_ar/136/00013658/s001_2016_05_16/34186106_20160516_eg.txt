DATE OF STUDY: 05/16/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and mainly asleep




HISTORY:

a 63 y.o. woman p/w SOB and chest pain, along with a change in mental status.



No other past medical history.

MEDICATIONS:

Haldol and Lovenox



SEDATION: See above.



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The limited waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized theta and
beta frequencies, with at best a 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-
posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is absent. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-
25Hz activity is also seen.






During drowsiness diffuse theta background slowing is seen.



Sleep is characterized by sleep transients, with vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Generalized slow wave and disorgaznization, mild to moderate


2. Excess beta


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and mainly asleep  routine EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse
background slowing and disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication
effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
