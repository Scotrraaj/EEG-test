HISTORY:

33 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O OPIATE OVERDOSE

AND PEA CODE X 2 1ST DOWN FOR 20MIN, 2ND DOWN FOR 15MIN.



MEDICATIONS:

None



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:





No posterior dominant rhythm is present.



The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not


seen.


There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the

recording.



There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no


change with visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli.


This EEG was not performed according to the guidelines of the

American Clinical Neurophysiology Society for the determination


of electrocerebral inactivity.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:


1. Isoelectric suppressed background



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an isoelectric EEG not performed according the the ACNS

guidelines for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.

This EEG is consistent with, but not diagnostic of, cerebral


death.
