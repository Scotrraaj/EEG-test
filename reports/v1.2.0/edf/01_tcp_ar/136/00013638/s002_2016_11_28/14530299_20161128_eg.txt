HISTORY: 59 y.o. female with a history of cardiac arrest, now undergoing hypothermia and experiencing myoclonic jerks.  Hypothermia protocol started on 11/28/2016 in am.  MEDICATIONS: No current facility-administered medications for this visit.  No current outpatient prescriptions on file. Facility-Administered Medications Ordered in Other Visits: furosemide (LASIX) injection 40 mg ipratropium-albuterol (DUO-NEB) nebulizer solution 3 mL DOPamine (INTROPIN) 800 mg/250 mL (3,200 mcg/mL) in D5W infusion vasopressin (PITRESSIN) 100 Units in dextrose 5 % in water 250 mL infusion midazolam (VERSED) 50 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL infusion atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg metoprolol tartrate (LOPRESSOR) tablet 25 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units valproate (DEPACON) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB   SEDATION: versed and fentanyl  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/28/2016, - 11/29/201)  BACKGROUND: There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of severe burst suppression pattern that lessens as the recording progresses.  By the end of the recording epoch bursts of activity occur on average every 30-60 seconds.  Burst of activity consist of irregular generalized sharply contoured 7-9 Hz activity and last ~ 1 seconds.  By the end of the recording epoch they occur in pairs, several seconds apart.  Clinically, they are associated with brief eye opening, slowly moving upward gaze and a brief body jerk.  They are not stimulus induced.    PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None    EKG: A single lead captured heart rate of 72 bpm.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal ~13 hours long term video EEG due to: Burst-suppression pattern, lack of reactivity and myoclonic jerks.  These findings indicate marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction and in a patient who suffered anoxic brain injury are generally associated with poor chance of meaningful neurological recovery.    -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (11/29/2016- 11/30/2016, 6 AM)  BACKGROUND: the degree of burst suppression lessened throughout the recording epoch.  By the end of the recording epoch the background became continuous, consisting of a mixture of low amplitude polymorphic delta activity and up to 7-8 Hz theta activity.  Additionally, voltages decreased throughout the study.   No background reactivity is observed.   PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): ventilator artifact  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: discrete episodes of eye opening and brief body jerks stopped by the end of the recording epoch  EKG: A single EKG lead captured heart rate of 120 bpm   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Abnormal 24 hour continuous EEG due to ongoing severe background slowing and lack of reactivity.  These findings are indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  The degree of diffuse slowing decreased throughout the recording epoch. Progressive decrease in the background voltages (given presumed absence of sedating agents) is concerning for worsening diffuse cerebral dysfunction that, in this patient with anoxic brain injury, could be related to worsening diffuse cerebral edema.
