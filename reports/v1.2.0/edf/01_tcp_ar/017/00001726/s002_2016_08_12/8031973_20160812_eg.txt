SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric and reactive, with a fairly organized mixture of alpha, beta, and
theta frequencies, with fragments of a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm that
approaches 8 Hertz. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present
but suboptimal.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

There is occasional left frontal polymorphic slowing.



There are frequent spikey waveforms over F7, F8 that appear most consistent with lateral rectus spikes.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Occasional left frontal polymorphic slowing

3. Tachycardia


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of the presence of left frontal dysfunction
superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Tachycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.



A call was placed to this patient's long term care facility to notify them of the tachycardia.
