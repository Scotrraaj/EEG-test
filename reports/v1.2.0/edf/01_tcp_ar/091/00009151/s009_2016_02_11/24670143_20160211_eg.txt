TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record,

although the patient was not cooperative and included a single


channel of EKG.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of


generalized symmetric 5-7 Hertz. The normal anterior-to-posterior

gradient is present and 8.3 Hz PDR is   present. There are


multiple movement artifacts.


Drowsiness was brief and includes a single burst of paroxysmal

slowing.



Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Not possible



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Slow diffuse background

2. Mildly slow alpha Rhythm.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are suggestive of  an encephalopathy, but are not

specific for any cause.  No epileptiform features were seen.
