SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric.


The left hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of theta, alpha, and beta, with a posterior
dominant rhythm ~6-7 Hz.


The right hemisphere consists of disorganized theta and delta, with attenuated faster frequencies,
with no definite posterior dominant rhythm.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured


Moderate generalized slowing is present.


Continuous right hemispheric polymorphic slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm, with occasional PVCs, is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate generalized slowing

2. Continuous right hemispheric polymorphic slowing


3. Continuous attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of right hemispheric cerebral and cortical dysfunction,
correlating with known history of right MCA infarct.


There is additional evidence for a moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.
