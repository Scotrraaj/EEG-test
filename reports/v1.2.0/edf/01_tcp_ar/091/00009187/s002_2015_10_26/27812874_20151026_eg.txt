History:	44 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX OF SEIZURES. LAST SZ 1/15. DUE TO NO MEDS NO INSURANCE. NOW EVALUATION. PMHX: SEIZURES, PTSD, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION
Medications:	DILANTIN (ON PSYCH MEDS DOESNT HAVE)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves. Marked bursts of rhythmic midtemporal theta of drowsiness are seen over the left anterior temporal region.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving. HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional

information. Excessive beta activity could be due  benzodiazepines or barbiturates.â€¨ to the medication effect, such as
