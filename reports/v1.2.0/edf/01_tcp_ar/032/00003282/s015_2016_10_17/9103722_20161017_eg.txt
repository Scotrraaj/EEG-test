No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional bursts of bi-frontal predominant spike and wave at 4Hz lasting for 1-2 seconds. The
majority appear to have a symmetric onset but some have a latency or a voltage asymmetry. There
was no clinical correlate to the burst.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Spike and wave at 4Hz





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to bifrontal spike and wave discharges.
These discharges can be indicative of generalized epilepsy or alternatively the discharges may be
due a epileptogenic focus with rapid bilateral spread.
