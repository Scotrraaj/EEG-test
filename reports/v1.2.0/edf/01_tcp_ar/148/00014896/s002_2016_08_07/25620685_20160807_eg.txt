HISTORY: 86 y.o. female with a history of prior burr hole drainage for bilateral subdural hematoma s/p fall, left occipital laceration, with acute onset of encephalopathy referred for EEG for assessment of mental status change.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB Lorazepam (ATIVAN) injection 1 mg valsartan (DIOVAN) tablet 160 mg acetaminophen-codeine (TYLENOL #3) 300-30 mg per tablet 1 tablet sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg morphine injection 2 mg ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet Bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) EC tablet 10 mg magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) packet 17 g alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL multivitamin (THERAPEUTIC-M) 9 mg iron-400 mcg per tablet 1 tablet cefepime (MAXIPIME) 2 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+ labetalol (NORMODYNE,TRANDATE) injection 20 mg hydralazine (APRESOLINE) injection 10 mg metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 5 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record due to long periods of diffuse muscle artifact. The study included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (8/7/2016, 10:50 - 8/8/2016, 09:11)  BACKGROUND: The background consists of disorganized delta and theta with occasional admixed alpha. There is no posterior dominant rhythm.   There is abundant, nearly continuous, sharply contoured theta over the left posterior quadrant.  Quieter states consist of attenuation of faster frequencies with increased prevalence of delta. Sleep transients are not seen.  There is moderate generalized slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. There are occasional periods of rhythmic theta-delta over the left temporal region at 3.5 Hz for <3 sec  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 60s  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal, limited-by-artifact, long term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Abundant, near continuous sharply contoured theta over the left posterior quadrant 3. Occasional periods of rhythmic theta-delta over the left temporal region that do not clearly evolve  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are consistent with focal cerebral dysfunction over the left posterior quadrant (likely structural in etiology), superimposed on a moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Rhythmic slowing over the left temporal region is a marker of epileptogenic potential over that region. There were no clinical or electrographic seizures reported or detected.
