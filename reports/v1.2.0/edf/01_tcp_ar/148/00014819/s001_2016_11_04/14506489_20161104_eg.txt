SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient was unresponsive during the study. Background is characterized by generalized poorly
organized low to medium and medium amplitude 2-5 Hz activity interspersed with brief episodes of
diffuse voltage attenuation lasting 1-2 seconds. Mild interhemispheric asymmetry was noted with
amplitudes higher on the left. Occasional sharp waves and sharply contoured slow waves were seen
over the left anterior temporal region at F7 and T3.





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal comatose/asleep EEG due to:


1. Diffuse background slowing and disorganization.

2. Interhemispheric asymmetry with higher amplitudes on the left.


3. Occasional left frontotemporal sharp transients at F7 and T3.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a bihemispheric functional disturbance, somewhat greater
over the right hemisphere, with infrequent irritative sharp transients in the left frontotemporal region.
