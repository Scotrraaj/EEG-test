HISTORY:

52 y.o. man p/w headache and not talking. CTH was negative. pmh
depression.


Viral meningitis with CPS - r/o HSE

MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN) injection 1 g



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present at T3 region during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
