HISTORY:

67 y.o. male with a history of hydrocephalus and liver disease referred
for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  There is a lot of muscle artifact noted




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7-8 Hertz  40 uVposterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There
is excess theta.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained



Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 55 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. slowing of the alpha rhythm

2. generalized background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are suggestive of a diffuse cerebral process.  Hydrocephalus or liver disease can both
produce this finding.  There were no epileptiform features
