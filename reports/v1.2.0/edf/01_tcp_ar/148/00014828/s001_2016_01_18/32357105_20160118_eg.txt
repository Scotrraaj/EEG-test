HISTORY:

a 78 YO WOMAN PRESENTS FROM OSH WITH FALL, UTI AND

SEPSIS 2/2. PT REMAINS UNRESPONSIVE ON NO SEDATION. NEURO EVAL


FOR DNR. EEG TO EVALUATE.

PMH: DM, HTN, HLD



MEDICATIONS:

FLAGYL, PROTONIX, MEROPENEM




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present.


Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage

delta and with stimulation theta activity with absenc the of the

expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. Diffuse,

frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are


present intermittently troughout the recording.  These waveforms

demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.




Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1. Triphasic waves, intermittent


2. Diffuse slow, Moderate to severe



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an ABNORMAL routine EEG because of intermittent


frontally-maximal triphasic waves and moderate to severe diffuse

background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a moderate


to severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically

nonspecific, but at least in part suggestive of a metabolic


origin.
