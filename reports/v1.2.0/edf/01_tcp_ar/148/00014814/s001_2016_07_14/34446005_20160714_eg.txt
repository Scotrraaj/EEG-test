HISTORY:

61 y.o. female with a history of ICH, venous thrombosis referred for routine
EEG. Currently with depakote prophylaxis, no history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Xanax, percocet, depakote, coumadin




SEDATION:none


TECHNIQUE:


This is a technically challenging EEG. A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was
recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system.
This EEG included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:




In wakefulness there is generous muscle artifact with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm intermittently disrupted
on the left. There is also occasional bioccipital slowing noted.


During drowsiness, there is an increase in beta and slow rolling eye movements. In stage 1 sleep
prominent POSTs are seen on the right only. In drowsiness there is also more rhythmic slowing from
the left occipital region.




Sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles but are not sustained.


Mild generalized slowing is present.


Focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


One burst of sharply contoured activity on the Left is noted


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of max 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead but is slightly irregular.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Background slowing and disorganization

2. Focal slowing on the left superimposed

3. Intermittent bioccipital slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



The focal slowing is ipsilateral to the region of this patient's ICH. No definitive sharp waves were seen.
