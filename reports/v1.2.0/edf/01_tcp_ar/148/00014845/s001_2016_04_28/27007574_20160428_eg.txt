DATE OF STUDY: 04/28/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: 


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep





HISTORY:

a 59 y.o. male with a history of possible anoxic insult on 4-27-2016 referred for
routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.


Current facility-administered medications for this visit.

zofran

SEDATION: propofol



TECHNIQUE:

Bedside portable  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile/verbal stimulation.
Patient was intubaged





EEG BACKGROUND:





The  background is characterized by the presence of a symmetric mixture of theta, alpah  and beta
frequencies. There is no symmetric  posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).  Shifting slow delta is seen
early in the record.


Slow rolling eye movements, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep includes some vertex waves



Moderate generalized slowing is present.

No definitive focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 76 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings should be evaluated in the context of pharmacological sedation. There were no
epileptiform features.  The EEG is variable and reactive: both positive prognostic features.
