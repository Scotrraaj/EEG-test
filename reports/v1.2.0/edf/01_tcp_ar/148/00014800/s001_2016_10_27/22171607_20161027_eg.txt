SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.


The background over the right consists of 8.5 Hz alpha posteriorly with weak AP (anterior-to-posterior)
gradient and diffuse excess polymorphic theta activity.



The background over the left consists of unstable 7-7.5 Hz theta activity posteriorly, weak AP
(anterior-to-posterior) gradient, diffuse polymorphic theta and delta activity that is most pronounced
over the left frontotemporal region.




Symmetrical sleep spindles and K-complexes are captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild diffuse slowing


2. Continuous left hemispheric focal slowing that is most pronounced over the left frontotemporal
region.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.


Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the left.


The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
