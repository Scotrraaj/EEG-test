HISTORY:

25 y.o. female with a history of febrile seizures, intellectual delay, asthma,
bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, PTSD, and seizures, referred for routine EEG following an
episode of loss of consciousness to evaluate for epileptic versus nonepileptic etiology.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) tablet 400 mg

divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 24 hr tablet 250 mg





SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background consists of a mixture of symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta
activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. A moderate amount of slow frontal eye
movement artifact is seen.




During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with fair effort and produces no
effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 105 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
