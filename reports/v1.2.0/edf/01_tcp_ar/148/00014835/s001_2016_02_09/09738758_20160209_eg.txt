SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric

and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal


anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is

present.

There is continuous sharply contoured beta activity noted over

the right fronto-temporal region.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

There is abundant right fronto-temporal polymorphic slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake-only routine EEG due to:

1. Continuous sharply contoured beta activity noted over the


right fronto-temporal region

2. Abundant right fronto-temporal polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of right

fronto-temporal dysfunction. The continuous sharply contoured


beta activity over the right fronto-temporal region is likely a

breach artifact and is consistent with this patient's prior


history of craniotomy.
