HISTORY:
a 65 y.o. female who presented with a large

right basal ganglia hemorrhage, now referred for routine EEG for


characterization of episodes of right face and hand twitching.



MEDICATIONS: LABETALOL, AMLODIPINE, FAMOTIDINE, LOVENOX, TYLENOL,


HYDRALAZINE, ZOFRAN



SEDATION: none listed




TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.







EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric.


The left hemisphere consists of a mixture of alpha, theta, and

delta frequencies organized in an anterior-posterior gradient


that is present but suboptimal, with fragments of a posterior

dominant rhythm that approaches 8 Hz.

The right hemisphere consists of disorganized theta and delta

with attenuated faster frequencies; there is no posterior


dominant rhythm.




Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by further background

slowing of both hemispheres; there are no clear sleep transients.



Mild generalized slowing is present.


Continuous right hemispheric focal slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


An episode of right face and left wrist twitching is captured at

11:30


CLINICAL: a subtle twitching movement of the right cheek is

captured on camera; several seconds later there is rhythmic

twitching of the right wrist.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 114 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Continuous right hemispheric polymorphic slowing

3. Episode of twitching described above without EEG correlate




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of right hemispheric

dysfunction, likely structural, superimposed on mild diffuse


cerebral dysfunction.




The episode of twitching described above had no EEG

correlate; however, a surface negative seizure cannot entirely be

excluded.
