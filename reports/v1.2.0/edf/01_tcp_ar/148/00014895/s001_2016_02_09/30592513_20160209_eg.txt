HISTORY:

22 y.o. female with a history of episodes of

lightheadedness, candy taste in mouth in mouth with LOC/shaking,


with postictal fatigue and achiness referred for routine EEG for

evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times


daily (with meals).

Prenatal Multivit-Ca-Min-Fe-FA (PRENATAL FORMULA) Tablet, Take 1

tablet by mouth daily.


ondansetron (ZOFRAN-ODT) 4 mg disintegrating tablet, Take 1

tablet by mouth every 8 hours as needed for Nausea.

CONDOMS, NON-LATEX, LUBRICATED (CONDOMS - MALE) Misc, 2 Units by


Misc.(Non-Drug; Combo Route) route as needed.




carBAMazepine (CARBATROL) 200 mg 12 hr capsule, Take 1 capsule by

mouth 2 times daily.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 48-54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.

Bradycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.
