SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric.

The left hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of alpha and beta with excess delta. There
is a posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz.


The right hemisphere consists of a poorly organized mixture of delta and alpha. Posterior dominant
rhythm is not clearly present.





During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm on the left as
well as diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Mild-moderate generalized slowing is present.

Continuous right hemispheric focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild-moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Continuous right hemispheric focal slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of right hemispheric dysfunction (likely structural in etiology)
superimposed on a mild-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
