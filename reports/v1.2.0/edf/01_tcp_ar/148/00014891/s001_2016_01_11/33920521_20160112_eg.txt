History:	79 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O POST CABG ON 1/7/16, HASN'T BEEN 
	ABLE TO WAKE UP POST SURGERY. FOUND TO HAVE ACUTE STROKE
Medications:	HEPARIN, INSULIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low 
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of 
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the central region during wakefulness, 
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic 
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was reactivity to tactile and 
stimuli.  HR was 108
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent central
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  intermittent focal slowing in the central region.  This 
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. In addition 
there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically 
nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
