HISTORY:

58 y.o. male with a history of seizures, now

was found to be slumped over.



MEDICATIONS:

Topamax


Valium




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



Diffuse excess beta activity is noted.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.






EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy portable 21-minute EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.


No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not

recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep


recording may provide additional information.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication

effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
