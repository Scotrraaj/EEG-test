HISTORY:

23 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy, retrocerebellar arachnoid


cyst and mild compression of the left cerebellar hemisphere. Admitted with vertigo and  referred for
routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Lamictal, VPA others

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a slow but reasonably symmetric mixture
of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 6.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There is
generous theta.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. Shifting slowing is seen.



Sleep is not captured



Modest generalized slowing is present.

Shifting focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Broad QRS.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Generalized slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This EEG is improved in comparison to a study in 2015 which identified high amplitude continuous
R temporal slowing.  No epileptiform features were identified.
