HISTORY:

57 yo male p/w one episode of



PMH: DM, HTN, HLD




MEDICATIONS:

Lisnopril, Amlodipine, Metoprolol, Pravastatin, Suboxone



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG HV and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and theta frequencies, with a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at best reached 7 Hertz.




During drowsiness further diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate generalized slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to moderate diffuse background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
