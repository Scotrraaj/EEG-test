HISTORY:

62 y.o. MAN WITH HEART AND LIVER FAILURE, RENAL

DISEASE. MARCH 1ST HAD LVAD PUT IN, POST OP WAS NOT WAKING UP.


KIDNEY PROBLEMS NOW AND ON DIAYLSIS. EEG TO EVALUATE PT.


MEDICATIONS:


INSULIN, FLAGYL, URSODIOL, PROTONIX, METOPROLOL, ALOPURINOL,

VANCOMYCIN, ALBUMIN, CEFEPIME



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was

characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity


with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies.


Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


The single EKG lead malfunctioned.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate to severe diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of


moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No seizures or

epileptiform activity were seen.
