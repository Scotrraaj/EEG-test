SEDATION: see above



TECHNIQUE:

A q our bedside portable video Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded
using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is characterized by the presence of a symmetric mixture rhythmic frontal delta with
smaller amounts of beta and theta.  In the frontal region, there are waveforms with triphasic
morphology.


There is reactivity and variability.  Tactile stimulation produces an increase in beta frequency activity





Marked generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal sedated only routine EEG due to:

1.  Marked generalized slowing

2. Triphasic waves


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are typical of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. There were no epileptiform
features. There is reactivity and variability.
