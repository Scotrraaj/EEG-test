SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  No events were marked by the clinical staff.
DAY 1 (11/22/2015, 2:00PM - 11/23/2015, 06:00)
BACKGROUND: The background is characterized by near complete amplitude suppression, even when examined at a sensitivity of 2 microvolts/mm. There is no reactivity and no spontaneous cerebral activity. There is diffuse ECG artifact. Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a markedly abnormal 24 hour video LTM EEG recording due to near absence of cerebral activity even when viewed at a sensitivity of 2 microvolts/mm. In the absence of ongoing sedation, this EEG has a grave prognosis for neurological recovery.  These findings were communicated to the primary team.  Reading attending:
