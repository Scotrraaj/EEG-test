DATE OF STUDY: 04/15/2016


RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient

EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 45 y.o. female with a history of refractory


epilepsy, question of right temporal lobe epilepsy versus

nonepileptic seizures referred for routine EEG for

characterization of seizures.  Problematic hyponatremia.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


BENEFIBER, GUAR GUM, PO, Take  by mouth daily.

famotidine (PEPCID) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth every

evening.


clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 0.25 mg disintegrating tablet, Take 1 mg by

mouth nightly. Also Take 0.25mg  twice daily

FLUoxetine (PROZAC) 20 mg capsule, 40 mg daily. Alternate between


50 mg




ATELVIA 35 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.), every 7 days.

metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 25 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth


daily.

Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, (VITAMIN D) 1,000 unit Tablet, Take


2,000 Units by mouth daily.

docusate sodium (COLACE) 100 mg capsule, Take 100 mg by mouth as

needed.

fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/Actuation nasal spray, Inhale 2


sprays into the nose as needed.

multivitamin capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.


zonisamide (ZONEGRAN) 100 mg capsule, Weeks 1-2: 100 mg at

bedtime. After 2nd week, increase to 200 mg at bedtime.

OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 300 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3

times daily. 300 mg q8h



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is abnormal.  There is diffuse 5-6 Hz

theta.  It is also characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 8.5Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).


The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.  Central temporal wicket was also


identified



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained


Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Occasional wicket waves are noted during drowsiness over the


temporal regions



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 55-60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Excess theta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings  are nonspecific.  The excess theta may be due to


this patient's medications.  No epileptiform features were

identified in this EEG.
