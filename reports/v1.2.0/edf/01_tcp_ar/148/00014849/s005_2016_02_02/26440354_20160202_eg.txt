HISTORY:

36 y.o. male who presented on 1/30 with status

epilepticus, referred for routine EEG for characterization of


seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


Dilantin 100 mg q8h


SEDATION: received load of Ativan 1/30



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

Most of the study consists of sleep punctured by brief periods of


wakefulness.



Prior to falling asleep at the start of the study, the waking

background consists of a well organized symmetric mixture of

alpha and excess of beta frequencies, with a symmetric and

reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal


anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is

present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing with sharply contoured theta activity are


seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. There were no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.

Excess beta can be seen in the setting of certain medications

such as benzodiazepines.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


A normal EEG does not preclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
