HISTORY:

74 y.o. female with a history of syncopal spell this AM referred for routine EEG for
evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The  background is abnormal.  With maximal stimulation, there is a diffusely pattern. In the absence
of this, the background demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern, with a mixture of delta/theta.  There are
multi-focal sharps/spikes from either hemisphere, including bifrontal, posterior, T3 T5, P3



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Moderate generalized slowing is present.


Shifting focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Abundant (>1/10s)  See above. Some are posterior, triphasic morphology


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:




This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized slowing with multifocal spikes


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are frequently found in association with metabolic encephalopathy but the sharp
waves and spikes suggest a potential for seizures
