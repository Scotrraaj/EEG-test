HISTORY: 74 y.o. female with a history of episode of unresponsiveness referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: fentanyl (SUBLIMAZE) 1 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion heparin 25,000 units (100 units/mL) in 0.45% sodium chloride 250 mL infusion (Premix) sodium chloride 0.9 % with bumetanide (BUMEX) 3 mg midazolam (VERSED) 1 mg/mL injection 1 mg fentanyl (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection 25 mcg Alprazolam (XANAX) tablet 0.25 mg acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 325 mg vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,250 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB butalbital-acetaminophen-caffeine (FIORICET, ESGIC) per tablet 1 tablet senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 100 mcg digoxin (LANOXIN) tablet 0.25 mg  SEDATION: see above  TECHNIQUE: A  21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) video Monitor was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.  DAY 1 (- 9/1/2016, 15:00)  BACKGROUND: EEG BACKGROUND: The background is initially abnormal.  With maximal stimulation, there is a diffusely pattern. In the absence of this, the background demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern, with a mixture of delta/theta.  There are multi-focal sharps/spikes from either hemisphere, including bifrontal, posterior, T3 T5, P3. However, after 5 PM there are sections of the record with a much better organized theta patter  During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and diffuse background slowing are seen. Later in the record more well defined sleep was noted.  Moderate generalized slowing is present.   Shifting focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Abundant (>1/10s) See above. Some are posterior, triphasic morphology  EVENTS: None With tactile or verbal stimuli, the patient wakes up, interacts, laughs at a joke (despite ETT) and the EEG transitions to a faster theta pattern   EKG: A single lead captured 81, irregular at times tachycardic  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Intermittent generalized slow pattern with multifocal sharp waves Given the patient's responsiveness and the EEG change, the slower pattern with multifocal sharp waves is likely a metabolic pattern. There are atypical triphasic waves as well. No seizures were recorded.
