HISTORY:

71 y.o. female with a history of dementia

and seizures referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental


status change.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

metformin (GLUMETZA) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth

daily (with breakfast).


multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth

daily.

carbidopa-levodopa (SINEMET) 10-100 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet


by mouth 3 times daily.

insulin lispro (HUMALOG) 100 unit/mL injection, Inject  into the

skin 3 times daily (before meals).


omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.




Indications: Prevention of Stress Ulcer

donepezil (ARICEPT) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth nightly.


Indications: Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Type Dementia

levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 250 mg tablet, Take 250 mg by mouth 2


times daily. Indications: Simple-Partial Epilepsy


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None

TECHNIQUE:


A bedside portable 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

challenged record and included a single channel of EKG but no HV


nor photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of

diffusely slow and disorganized pattern. It is difficult to

define wake and drowsy but the overall background consists of


diffuse 5.5-7 Hz theta with some underlying irregular delta and

infrequent FIRDA



After stimulation there is more eye movements and more muscle

artifact.



During drowsiness, the EEG is more synchronous



Sleep is not sustained.


Generalized slowing is present.

No signficant focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None, though there is electrode artifact



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile stimulation on the patient


produces an arousal.


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 76 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized background slowing


2. Disorganized background pattern



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are non specific and can be seen in a diffuse

disorder of cerebral function including dementia or other


encephalopathy.
