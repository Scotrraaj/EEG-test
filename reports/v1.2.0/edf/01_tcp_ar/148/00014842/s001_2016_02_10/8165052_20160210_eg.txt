HISTORY:

35 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy,

learning disability, now seizure free  referred for routine EEG


for characterization of seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 150 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth

daily. Req brand nec Lamictal from Bridges to Access program:


Diagnosis: CPS 150 BID disp 90 days, 3 refills

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2

times daily. Diagnosis: Complex partial epilepsy.  Please


dispense 90 supply via ucb  Patient Assistance program

multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth

daily.


CALCIUM PO, Take  by mouth. Indications: unknown dose - check




with patient



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen. Asymmetric EOMS were noted


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous , sleep spindles . Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: elicits an increase in amplitude of the

background.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is anormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. No epileptiform features noted at this time



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal EEG does not exclude diagnosis of epilepsy. Prior EEGS


demonstrated left anterior and frontotemporal sharp waves
