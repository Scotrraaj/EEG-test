HISTORY:

33 y.o. male FOUND UNRESPONSIVE 1/31 NOON.

THOUGHT TO HAVE OD (+++COCAINE AND METHADONE). AT SOME POINT HAD


SEIZURE EPISCOPAL.


MEDICATIONS:


KEPPRA


SEDATION:PROPOFOL AND FENTANYL STOPPED APPROX 15 MIN  PRIOR TO


STUDY


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The limited waking background is characterized by the presence of

a poorly organized fronto-central beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present. However most marked in the background is

the presence of diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz


activity,



The EEG is mainly seen during drowsiness with attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and moderate

diffuse background slowing are seen.



Some sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left

anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during


drowsiness



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Intermittent, left anterior temporal focal slowing


2. Excessive beta in wakelfulness


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal limited wakefulness and mainly drowsy/sleep


routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the left

anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal


cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.

Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication

effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
