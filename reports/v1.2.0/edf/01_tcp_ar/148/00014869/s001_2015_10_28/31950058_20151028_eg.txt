History:		78 year old man who presents with change in mental status, concerning for status epilepticus.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, lethargic


Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present intermittently the recording. These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag. Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. Profound anterior EMG artifact is present during some portions of the recording.

Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, marked Triphasic waves, intermittent
No electrographic seizures Artifact, EMG, intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 23-minute EEG because of moderate diffuse slowing and intermittent triphasics waveforms. These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin. Triphasic waves are a nonspecific EEG finding that can be seen in hepatic encephalopathy, uremia and anoxia. Intermittent bilateral anterior EMG artifact limits the interpretation of the recording - subtle changes might have been missed
