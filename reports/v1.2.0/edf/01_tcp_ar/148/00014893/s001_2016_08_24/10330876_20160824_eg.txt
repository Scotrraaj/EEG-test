SEDATION: Versed



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel stat electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in the emergency room
using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a symmetric and reactive 9-11 Hertz
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). A moderate amount of generalized low amplitude 18-30 Hz
activity was seen. EKG artifact was also noted.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



In addition, at 3:48:51 and 3:59:25, low amplitude spikes were seen in the left temporal region at T3
and similar discharges on the right at T4 during drowsiness were noted at 3:57:29 and 4:01:02,
having the appearance of "small sharp spikes" (benign epileptiform transients of sleep). A single
sharp transient on the right at F8-T4 was seen during drowsiness at 3:53:31 of uncertain significance.




Sleep is characterized by normal increased prominence of low to medium amplitude delta and theta
frequency slowing along with vertex waves. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 61 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

Probably normal awake and asleep routine EEG. Infrequent bitemporal small sharp spikes during
drowsiness and sleep likely represent benign epileptiform transients of sleep. A single sharp transient
in the right anterior temporal region during drowsiness was noted of uncertain clinical significance.
No clinical or electrographic seizures were recorded and no other pathologic epileptiform discharges
were seen.
