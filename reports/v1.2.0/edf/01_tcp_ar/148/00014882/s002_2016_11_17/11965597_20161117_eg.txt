HISTORY:

63 y.o. female with a history of COPD, intubatedon 11/15 with episode left
sided stiffening, underlying cerebrovascular disease,  referred for routine EEG for assessment of
mental status change.  No clinical seizures have been reported since the initial intubation.  She is
intubated sedated poorly responsive




MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

dexmedetomidine (PRECEDEX) 400 mcg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion

fentaNYL (SUBLIMAZE) 1 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion


vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+

aztreonam (AZACTAM) 2 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB MB+

fentaNYL (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection 25 mcg


diltiazem (CARDIZEM) tablet 30 mg

QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) tablet 25 mg

methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (Solu-MEDROL) injection 40 mg


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA)


BP 94/63  Pulse 64  Temp (!) 96.7 F (35.9 C)  Resp 13  Ht 5' 3



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and  Verbal /tactile stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is abnormal, characterized by a diffusely slow, chaotic and disorganized pattern with
rhythmic theta and superimposed 2-3 Hz delta


Marked generalized slowing is present.

Shifting focal slowing is present.  Overall, the EEG is relatively symmetric



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: In the sharply contoured, chaotic pattern there are underlying sharp
waves with clear phase reversals at T5 and in the left central region


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Underlying, somewhat subtle frontally
predominant waveforms with triphasic morphology are noted



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile stimulation of the patient clearly produces an arousal with an
increase in rhythmic theta


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal ICU EEG due to:

1.  Marked background slowing


2. Focal sharp waves on the left, most notably in the left posterior temporal region.  Overall relatively
infrequent

3.  Triphasic waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION: The overall background today is not as slow as the study 2 days ago.
Sharp waves were not identified in that study.  Both records are compatible with a severe toxic or
metabolic encephalopathy.  The impact of this patient's sedating medicines and clinical condition
can play a role in both EEGs.



As discussed with the consult team, if there is any question of subtle or underrecognized seizures,
additional EEG monitoring may be of value
