HISTORY:

63 y.o. female with a history of Hep C, COPD, HTN, asthma, and OSA referred
for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

diltiazem (CARDIZEM) tablet 30 mg

QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) tablet 25 mg


midazolam (VERSED) 1 mg/mL injection 2 mg

propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion

methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (Solu-MEDROL) injection 40 mg


albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 5 mg

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

famotidine (PEPCID) tablet 20 mg


oxyCODONE (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 5 mg

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg



ipratropium (ATROVENT) 0.02 % nebulizer solution 0.5 mg

budesonide (PULMICORT) nebulizer solution 0.5 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL



SEDATION: versed, propofol


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is nearly continuous with ~10% periods of attenuation admixed with delta and
superimposed alpha/beta. There is no reactivity to noxious stimulation, variability, or state change.



Severe generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal coma study bedside portable EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing, with disorganized background and lack of reactivity


2. Tachycardia



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may at least in
part be associated with sedating medications (versed, propofol).
