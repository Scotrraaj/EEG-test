HISTORY:

115 y.o. male with a history of anoxic brain injury, who remains unresponsive off
sedation.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application

cisatracurium (NIMBEX) 200 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 200 mL infusion

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.




The background consists of markedly attenuated slow delta activity vs complete burst-suppression
pattern.  There is no reactivity.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

EKG artifact



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no change in the background activity to visual, auditory,
tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to:

1. Marked background slowing and attenuation vs complete burst suppression pattern with no
evidence of reactivity.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  This EEG background is markedly worse
from the EEG background captured on the 12/02/2016 EEG.



This is  EEG was not performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the determination of
electrocerebral inactivity.
