SEDATION: versed


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.


The background consists of repetitive 0.5-3 seconds bursts of non-evolving activity admixed with brief
periods of discontinuity.  This activity is characterized by a mixture of polymorphic but stereotyped
diffuse frontally predominant sharply contoured theta and delta activity.




Clinically, there is continuous right facial and right thumb twitching.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 105 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate to severe diffuse background slowing, periods of discontinuity and lack of reactivity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is etiologically
nonspecific.


No ictal correlate seen with continuous right facial and thumb myoclonus.
