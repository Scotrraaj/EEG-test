HISTORY:

34 y.o. male with a history of anoxic brain injury.



MEDICATIONS:

famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg


hydrALAZINE (APRESOLINE) injection 5 mg

norepinephrine (LEVOPHED) 8 mg/250 mL (32 mcg/mL) in NSS infusion

lidocaine-epinephrine (PF) 1 %-1:200,000 injection 1 mL


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL




sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium bicarbonate injection 50 mEq

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.




There is no discernible cerebral activity.  There is no reactivity.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

EKG artifact



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no change in the background activity to visual, auditory,
tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to:

1. no discernible cerebral activity seen.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This finding indicates marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction.



This is EEG was not performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the determination of
electrocerebral inactivity
