HISTORY:

89 y.o.WOMAN PRESENTS WITH H/O CVA 3 MOS. AGO, NOW WITH SZ
ACTIVITY. CT NEG FOR BLEED.



MEDICATIONS:


KEPPRA, HEPARIN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically unsatisfactory
record due to continuous marked diffuse muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:







No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Moderate to severe diffuse slow waves


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a very limited abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to moderate to severe diffuse
background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators
of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.



Please note that no conclusions should be made due to the limited nature of the record, a repeat
study with sedation may be beneficial if clinically indicated,
