DATE OF STUDY: 05/20/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 56 y.o. female with a history of  subdural hematoma, stroke, right-sided weakness,
complicated previous hospital course which involved meningitis.  Possible seizures , referred for
routine EEG for characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

hydrOXYzine (ATARAX) 25 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH THREE TIMES DAILY AS
NEEDED

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 20 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH DAILY

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

docusate sodium (COLACE) 100 mg capsule, Take 100 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

pentoxifylline (TRENTAL) 400 mg CR tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH THREE TIMES DAILY



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.






SEDATION:



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

Focal slowing is present.  Intermittent bursts of isolated left mid temporal theta or delta were noted in
wakefulness and early drowsiness



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

WICKET



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Photic Stimulation: Driving response was present


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. intermittent left temporal focal slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in after stroke or subdural hematoma.  No epileptiform features
were identified
