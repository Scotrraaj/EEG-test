HISTORY:

45 y.o. MAN R HANDED. PT STATES HE WAS GOING OUT

AND THE NEXT THING HE KNOWS HE WOKE UP IN THE MEDCAL COLLEGE OF


VIRGINIA. DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING AFTER THAT. PT HAS A SCAR THAT

GOES FROM FZ,C4,P4,T6,T2. PMHX N/A.



MEDICATIONS:

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule,

naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet,


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2

times daily.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the




International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized mixture of alpha and beta frequencies with a higher

amplitude on the right central region, with a symmetric and


reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is


present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the P4/T4

region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. There is

an associated increase in amplitude and faster frequencies in

this region consistent with a breach rhythm.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 86 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Continuous focal slowing in the right temporo-parietal region


with an associated breach.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to

continuous focal slowing in the right temporo-parietal region.

This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this


region.
