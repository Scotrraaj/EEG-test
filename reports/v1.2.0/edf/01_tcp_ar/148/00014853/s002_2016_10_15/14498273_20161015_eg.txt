 HISTORY: 86 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy, bilateral CVA, acute SDH,  referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: labetalol (NORMODYNE,TRANDATE) injection 10 mg  Current Outpatient Prescriptions: levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 250 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times daily. aspirin 81 mg chewable tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily. metFORMIN (GLUCOPHAGE) 500 mg tablet, Take 1,000 mg by mouth 2 times daily (with meals). lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 2.5 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.  SEDATION: Ativan prior to the record  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.   DAY 1 (- 10/15/2016-  17:00 10/16/2016)  BACKGROUND: EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of a lot of muscle on the right, and a poorly organized symmetric mixture of theta more than alpha and beta frequencies, with an symmetric but reactive 6-7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) on the left, On the left the  normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude can be seen. The right hemisphere lacks the PDR and has significantly more delta  Drowsiness is not sustained Sleep is not well defined initially, then a delta pattern with R>L slowing and vertex waves.   Moderate to marked generalized slowing is present.   Superimposed R focal slowing is present.  The background is reactive, variable. There were asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Beneath the artifact, there are sharply contoured transients noted at P3 and T5.  These are sporadic and do not evolve. They are much  less prominent later in the record  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None Posterior dominant rhythm was present.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Occasional (1/hour to <1min) see above  EVENTS: None, the later sections do not demonstrate EOM abnormalities- eyes mostly closed  EKG: A single lead captured  HR 120 BPM  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Slow background 2. Superimposed R focal slow 3. Initially some L posterior temporal sharp waves No seizures were recorded
