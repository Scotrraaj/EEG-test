HISTORY:

28 y.o. male with a history of vibrating

spells referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal


events. VAGUE INFORMATION ABOUT HAVING STRESS SEIZURES AS CHILD.

ALSO COGNITIVE ISSUES. BLURRY VISION




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

UNKNOWN TO PATIENT, Indications: patient reports he takes


medication for diabetes

UNKNOWN TO PATIENT, Indications: pt reports he takes medication

for hypertension




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.









SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG , HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 12 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.






Sleep is not captured




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:




Hyperventilation: Produces an increase in amplitude of the


background




Photic Stimulation: Elicited one of the patient's typical

vibrating spells.  No pathological waveforms were identified.


Rather, a normal awake pattern was seen.




EVENTS:

One  Clinical event captured during this study.  Clinical

symptoms of vibrating with muscle artifact a normal awake EEG




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 114 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

The behavior recorded during this EEG did not have an EEG scalp

corollate
