HISTORY:

85 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O  RIGHT

INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE.



MEDICATIONS:

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and


reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) seen best over

the left hemisphere. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of

frequency and amplitude is present over the left hemisphere.

There is continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the


left hemisphere maximal in the anterior temporal region during

wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


There are multiple subclinical seizures.



There is a right fronto temporal rhythmic sharply contoured theta

that increases in frequency and amplitude lasting for seconds to

minutes. There is no clear clinical correlate to this discharges.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Right fronto-temporal subclinical seizures

2. Continuous right hemisphere focal slow maximal fronto temporal



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of a focal right

frontotemporal structural irritable region with subclinical

seizures. These findings were communicated to the primary team.

Patient will be hooked up to continuous EEG monitoring.
