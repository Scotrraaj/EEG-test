HISTORY:

78 y.o. male with a history of CHF, CAD, A Fib, DM, HBP, referred for routine
EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 100 mcg

aspirin EC tablet 81 mg


simvastatin (ZOCOR) tablet 40 mg

amiodarone (PACERONE) tablet 400 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg


cyanocobalamin tablet 2,000 mcg

warfarin (COUMADIN) tablet 2 mg







SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

Wakefulness is characterized by symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Low-voltage anteriorly predominant 18-30 Hz
activity is seen. Superimposed muscle artifact is noted.




During brief periods of drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm,
and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
