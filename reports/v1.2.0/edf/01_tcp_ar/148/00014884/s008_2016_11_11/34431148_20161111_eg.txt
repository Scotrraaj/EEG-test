HISTORY: 73 y.o. female with a history of localization related epilepsy after a right parieto-occipital hemorrhage, referred for EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg lacosamide (VIMPAT) 200 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg fentaNYL (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) 50 mcg/mL injection sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 24 hr tablet 750 mg PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) tablet 60 mg PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) tablet 45 mg lacosamide (VIMPAT) 200 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB   SEDATION: s/p Ativan as above  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record due to bitemporal muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/10/2016, 10:11 - 11/11/2016, 06:00)  *Study disconnected 11/10 15:51-16:30, 17:30-17:49, 17:51-20:53, 20:57-22:00, 23:44-00:00, 11/11 at repeated intervals up until 02:47   BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric. The left hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of alpha, theta, and admixed delta with irregular fragments of a 5-6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.     The right hemisphere consists of theta and delta with attenuated faster frequencies, punctuated by high amplitude (>100 uV) periodic discharges (see below). There is no posterior dominant rhythm on the right.   Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by further background slowing. Sleep transients are not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Continuous 0.5-1 Hz right posterior quadrant (T6/O2/C4 max) periodic discharges with admixed fast frequencies (LPD+FR)  EVENTS:  11/10/2016 at 12:25 (duration: 1 min 27 sec) Clinical: Behavioral arrest, left head and gaze deviation with elevation of left arm and irregular tremor of lips, left arm with admixed chewing motions and blinking. At offset, rubs eye with right hand. EEG: Onset of semi-rhythmic theta-range activity over the right posterior quadrant with admixed spikes, increasing in amplitude and slowing in frequency to ~3 Hz with admixed spikes  Additional similar electroclinical seizures 11/10 16:55 (duration: 1 min 36 sec); 11/11 03:36, 05:15 (duration: 2-3 min). Some of these seizures feature onset with sharply contoured alpha rather than theta.  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 70s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Continuous right hemisphere slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies 3. Continuous right posterior quadrant LPD+FR 4. Right posterior quadrant electroclinical seizures, ongoing    -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (11/11/2016, 06:00 - 11/12/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Continuous 0.5-1 Hz right posterior quadrant (T6/O2/C4 max) periodic discharges with admixed fast frequencies (LPD+FR)  EVENTS:  Seizures, all electroclinical unless specified below, similar to day 1 captured: 11/11 06:42, 09:16, 10:13, 11:59, 13:49, 14:46, 17:06 (duration: 2-3 min), 21:44 (subclinical; duration: 90 sec) 11/11 10:13 - raises R arm in air and appears confused. No clear change during this. Then electrographic seizure as previously described, though cannot assess semiology as nurse blocks camera view 11/12 02:24 (subclinical; duration: 24 sec)   EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in 70s-80s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Ongoing right posterior quadrant electroclinical seizures, which become less frequent, shorter duration, and lack clinical signs as day progresses   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (11/12/2016, 06:00 - 11/13/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. R posterior quadrant LPD+FR as on previous days 2. Rare L temporal (T3 max) sharp waves, noted in sleep  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s-80s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No seizures R posterior quadrant highly epileptogenic discharges persist Rare L temporal epileptogenic potentials  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 4 (11/13/2016, 06:00 - 11/14/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. R posterior quadrant LPD+R (fewer admixed fast frequencies) 2. Rare L temporal (T3 max) sharp waves, noted in sleep  EVENTS:  11/13 at 08:36 Clinical: Nurse watching patient eat notices she stops chewing and sticks her tongue out. Patient denies having a seizure. EEG: There is no change in background/interictal activity during this time  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s   DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No seizures Episode above had no EEG correlate, unlikely to represent seizure Right posterior highly epileptogenic discharges appear somewhat less "irritable" on this day. Rare left temporal epileptogenic potentials.   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 5 (11/14/2016, 06:00 - 11/14/2016, 08:28)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in 70s-80s   DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change from day 4 No clinical or electrographic events   -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Continuous right hemisphere slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies 3. Continuous right posterior quadrant LPD+FR 4. Right posterior quadrant electroclinical seizures, which become subclinical and shorter in duration over the course of the study and cease after 11/12 02:24 5. Rare L temporal (T3 max) sharp waves, noted in sleep   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are diagnostic for focal epilepsy of right posterior quadrant origin. There is additional evidence for left temporal epileptogenic potential, as well as right hemisphere cortical dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and moderate diffuse dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
