SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.



The background over the left hemisphere consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 7 Hz theta
activity posteriorly with poor AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient and excess polymorphic theta and
delta activity.




The background over the right consists of unstable low to moderate amplitude 5-7 Hz theta activity
posteriorly with poor AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient and excess polymorphic theta <<delta activity.
Delta activity is most pronounced over the right temporal region.



During brief drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.





Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing

2. Continuous focal right hemispheric slowing that is most prominent over the temporal region.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.

Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the right.



No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.



The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
