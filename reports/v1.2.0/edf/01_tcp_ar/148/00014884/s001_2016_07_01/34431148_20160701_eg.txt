HISTORY: 85 yo RH male with refractory Afib and two episodes speech arrest with persevered
comprehension. Patient had an event just before the EEG.

Medicines: Plavix, Heparin, Coumadin, others



Introduction:

Routine Digital video EEG was performed in lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode
placement and one channel EKG.   Patient is awake/sleep.  Hyperventilation + Photic stimulation
were performed.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG.




DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:

Wakefulness is characterized by: low voltage but symmetric 9 HzHz alpha and small amount
frontocentral beta.


Drowsiness: An increase in beta with slow rolling eye movements and drop out of alpha. There is
prominent beta.


Focal slowing is seen in wakefulness and drowsiness, characterized by rhythmic left frontal 3-4 Hz
activity.


Sleep: stage II was achieved- beta and spindles

Photic Stimulation: elicits symmetric driving.

EKG: 72-78  BPM irregular



Impression and Clinical Correlation:

This is an  abnormal awake and sleep 20 minute EEG




1. No epileptiform features


2. L frontocentral focal slowing = focal features

3. No generalized slowing.


This EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. Correlation with imaging and clinical scenario is
suggested.
