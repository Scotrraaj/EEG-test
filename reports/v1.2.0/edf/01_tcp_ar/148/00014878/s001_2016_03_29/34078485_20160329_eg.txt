HISTORY:

79 y.o. male who was transferred from an outside

hospital with a right PCA stroke and bilateral subdural


hematomas, found to have right gaze deviation and a PE, now

referred for routine EEG as a follow up study for evaluation of

paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS: DEPAKOTE, ASA, LOVENOX, ATENOLOL, FLOMAX,

ATORVASTATIN



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically




satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The record opens to diffuse muscle artifact obscuring all leads.


Within minutes, this activity resolves, revealing a disorganized,

low amplitude background consisting of mostly delta with admixed

theta.  Occasionally the record is variable with brief periods of

very low to low amplitude alpha, seen best over the posterior


regions.  There is no definite posterior dominant rhythm. Sleep

transients are not seen.



There is moderate to severe diffuse slowing.

There is no definite focal slowing or attenuation.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate to severe diffuse slowing


2. Background disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a


moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
