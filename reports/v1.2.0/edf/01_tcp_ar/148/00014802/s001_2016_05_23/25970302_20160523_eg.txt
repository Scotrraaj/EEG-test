HISTORY:

34 y.o. MAN WITH MR SINCE BIRTH WITH NURSE FRO NURSING HOME. PT HAS
NOT HAD SZ. IN YRS AND HAD ONE 3 MONTHS AGO, THEY BELIEVE IT WAS BECAUSE HE
WAS STRESSED. PMHX.MR, NON VERBAL




MEDICATIONS:

CARBAMAZEPINE



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:








The waking background is low amplitude symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and
a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Occasional right anterior temporal spike with a large field, low amplitude and a polyspike
morphology are seen mainly in sleep.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Right anterior temporal spikes, occasional



CLINICAL CORRELATION:






This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to spikes in the right anterior temporal
region which are potentially epileptogenic.
