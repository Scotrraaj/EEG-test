HISTORY:

44 y.o. FEMALE WITH AHX OF SZ SINCE INFANT. LAST SZ WAS LAST
MONTH.


MEDICATIONS:






SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the T3 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.



At one point the patient appears to arouse and there is a monomorphic left hemispheric maximal T3
delta discharge lasting for 9 seconds. There is no clinical correlate seen. This is most consistent with
temporal intermittent delta activity.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
diffuse slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Left mid-temporal focal slow.

2. One rhythmic left mid-temporal discharge most consistent with TIRDA.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine 1 hour EEG due to left midtemporal TIRDA and focal
slowing. TIRDA has a high correlation with epileptogenic activity arising from that region. The focal
slowing is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
