DATE OF STUDY: 04/27/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only





HISTORY:

a 44 y.o. male admitted unresponsive, status post suspected drug overdose.



MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs, no sedation.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.

The background is attenuated with no discernable activity.






ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal comatose portable EEG due to:

1. No discernable activity present


2. No reactivity


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction.



Lack of reactivity is indicative of poor chance of neurological recovery.



This EEG was NOT performed according to the ACNS guidelines for the determination of
electrocerebral inactivity.
