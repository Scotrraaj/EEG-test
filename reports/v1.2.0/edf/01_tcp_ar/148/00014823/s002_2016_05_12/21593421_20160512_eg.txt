HISTORY:


40 y.o. female with a history of opioid and methadone overdose, presented earlier
today and in outside emergency room with obtundation, severe lactic acidosis, possible seizure
referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Received one dose of Keppra


SEDATION: none



TECHNIQUE:

A  Video EEG 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG .  The patient was initially obtunded, then woke up at around
8 p.m. and extubated herself








DAY 1 (5/12/2016, 17:00- 5/13/2016 @ 11:139 AM)



BACKGROUND:


The waking background is  continuous, symmetric, the record begins with primarily theta and mixed
frequency delta  pattern.  Intermittent attenuation of the background was noted.  When the patient is
a bit more awake, moving about with eye opening, there is more of a delta theta pattern, or a low-
voltage beta pattern.  On rare occasions there is a hint of a posterior dominant rhythm on the 12th




Posterior dominant rhythm was emerging


The background is  Reactive,and variable.


By the morning of 13th, there was well defined stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles.

Wakefulness included an alpha rhythm and some excess theta and Lambda.

There were  no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



EVENTS: None



EKG: A single lead captured HR 90 BPM


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION and overall CONCLUSION:


Initially markedly slow pattern compatible with pharmacologic sedation, gradually improving over
time.
No seizures were recorded.
