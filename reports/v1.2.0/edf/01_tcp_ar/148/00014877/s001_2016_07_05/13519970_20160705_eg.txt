HISTORY:

57 y.o. Male admitted 7/1/2016 for UTI, referred for routine EEG for after a
possible seizure on 7/2/2016.



MEDICATIONS: Midodrine, Ceftriaxone, Acetaminophen, Vancomycin



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record
due to abundant muscle artifact, and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background symmetric, poorly organized, and consists of low amplitude alpha and beta
frequencies without a clear posterior dominant rhythm.





Drowsiness is characterized by further slowing of the background.



Sleep is not captured



Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal, technically limited, awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing and poor organization


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of presence of mild to moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
