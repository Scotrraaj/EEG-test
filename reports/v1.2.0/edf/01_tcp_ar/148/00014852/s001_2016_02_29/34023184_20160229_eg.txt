HISTORY:
4 days female - A 40 1/7 WK. GESATATION FEMALE. MOTHER PRESENTED TO HOSPITAL IN LABOR. DELIVERY WAS ATTEMPETED BUT SECONDARY TO A CATEGORY 2 TRACING AND ARREST OF DESCENT, AN C SECTION WAS PERFORMED. INFANT WAS DELIVERED LIMP


AND APNEIC.	Found to have small acute infarcts in the right occipital lobe and	mildly restricted diffusion in the left posterior frontal and parietal cortices. Referred for routine  EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.
MEDICATIONS:
No current	medications provided for this visit. SEDATION: none
TECHNIQUE:
A one-hour bedside, portable, digital video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and	Stimulation.	Standard neonatal montage was utilized.	Infant   had 2 clinical seizures.	Staff was present at the bedside to monitor the infant during these 2 events
EEG BACKGROUND: There is a vigorous and appropriately organized background for an infant of this age with appropriate mixed frequency background.	Frontal delta and delta brushes were noted as the infant transitions toward sleep.
No generalized slowing is present.
Focal slowing is present. C3 Cz-C4 delta was noted in drowsiness

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
Two seizures were recorded.
The team at the bedside described below seizures as remarkable for right hand elevation with fist-like activity in the right hand.	Looking at the video, for the first seizure when is remarkable is that the patient seems to have rhythmic repetitive movements of the left hand.

Reviewing the video for the second seizure, the right hand jerkiness clearer.
il 10: 22:52 AM duration 2: 51- infant is awake, head turned to the left, can see the left hand jerk.
EEG demonstrates rhythmic repetitive 2 Hz delta from the left
hemisphere particularly the left central region with a sharp wave left central maximum. The team is working  with the infant during the seizure and the onset and offset are a little obscured.
i2 10: 30: 35 duration 1: 43 - the tech notes that  the  patient's right hand  comes  up  and  is as noted  before  the first EEG	ictal change C3  delta	with more subtle C3 Cz small sharp was seen, but by 10: 31: 56 there is a clear L sharp wave.
Afterwards  the  infant transitions  to   sleep. OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed in a newborn.
EVENTS:
There are two no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.	See above




	


HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 131 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:
1. Two electrographic seizures, which with this technique localized to  the	the left central region
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These   findings  were  reported  by  phone  on   02/29/2016   to  the clinical team. This EEG is diagnostic of seizure and may be correlated with imaging and clinical picture.
