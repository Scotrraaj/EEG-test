HISTORY: 61 y.o. male with a history of severe epilepsy, CSE referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.  History of tremor  Admitted with VDRF, T 102, rigors vs S.E. found to have left sided pneumonia with pleural effusion  MEDICATIONS: lorazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,250 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB lacosamide (VIMPAT) 200 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB piperacillin-tazobactam (ZOSYN) 3.375 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB MB+ vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+ acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg valproate (DEPACON) 250 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB SEDATION: Propofol, versed, others TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  BP 92/49  Pulse 81  Temp (!) 102 °F (38.9 °C)  Resp 19  Ht 1.524 m (5')  Wt 60.5 kg (133 lb 6.1 oz)  SpO2 100%  BMI 26.05 kg/m2  DAY 1 (12/17/2016, 11:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric,  well-organized, and consists predominantly of beta with admixed alpha and infrequent delta . Posterior dominant rhythm was not present. The background is  reactive,  variable. There were   intermittent  asymmetries in amplitude and frequency including shifting slowing most prominently in the left central region. Stimulation of the patient produces arousal with eye movement but without interaction. Sleep pattern similar to wake pattern, but without muscle, EOMS and more generalized beta.   PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Rare bursts frontal delta  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. In the context of left central slowing, sharply contoured slowing or irregular sharp waves are seen in the left central region  2. There was also a left frontal sharp/slow wave discharge.  EVENTS: none.  EKG: A single lead captured 80-90 BPM   DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: Initial pattern c/w sedated study.  Generalized slow/beta pattern Shifting slowing but a bit  More L central with admixed sharp waves -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (12/18/2016, 06:00 - ,12/19/16 08:00) BP 110/61  Pulse 87  Temp 100.6 °F (38.1 °C) (Axillary)  Resp 15  Ht 1.524 m (5')  Wt 60.5 kg (133 lb 6.1 oz)  SpO2 98%  BMI 26.05 kg/m2 Current Facility-Administered Medications: lorazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,250 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB lacosamide (VIMPAT) 200 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB piperacillin-tazobactam (ZOSYN) 3.375 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB MB+ vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+ valproate (DEPACON) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB Lab Results      Component                Value               Date                      PHENOBARB                5.7 (L)             12/18/2016                VALPROATE                50.0                12/17/2016            BACKGROUND: No change.  Has some more sustained periods with wakefulness with generous beta, background theta and a glimpse of an 11 Hz alpha  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change, some attenuation, likely artifactual in the right posterior temporal region  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Sharply contoured activity left central region seems to have disappeared  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:   EVENTS:  At 1:30 in the morning, patient had an episode with desaturation to 90%, no epileptiform features were identified at this time.  Intermittent arousals were noted at the time that the patient seemed to have respiratory distress.  EKG: A single EKG lead captured 80-90 BPM   DAY  2 And overall IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION No seizures were identified.  Subtle focal features and some sharply contoured slowing were noted in the beginning of the record.   The overall record is remarkable for prominent beta, compatible with medication exposure.  On multiple occasions the patient seemed to be quite somnolent, but the EEG demonstrated an awake pattern.  Given the gravity of this patient's pulmonary infection, this constellation of behavioral features with otherwise unremarkable EEG may represent metabolic encephalopathy.
