DATE OF STUDY: 06/23/16 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only   HISTORY: a 52 y.o. male with a history of pulmonary HTN, now intubated, unresponsive with left sided twitching  referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.  MEDICATIONS: SEDATION: Fentanyl, Versed  TECHNIQUE: A  portable, ICU Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKGand verbal stimulation.  EEG BACKGROUND: The background includes a continuous, relatively symmetric mixture of alpha and theta frequency activity.  There is intermittent attenuation with a lower voltage more featureless delta pattern.  Intermittently, there is a bit of attenuation noted on the right  Marked No generalized slowing is present.   Subtle, intermittent focal slowing is present.  This was characterized by a lower voltage pattern on the right  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 83 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal ICU routine EEG due to: 1.  Marked slowing of the background. 2. Intermittent attenuation on the right.   CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a sedated study.  The reactivity to stimuli is a positive prognostic feature.  No epileptiform features were noted.  The intermittent attenuation on the right is a subtle finding, of unclear clinical significance in this critical care study.   Attending Epileptologist:  I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
