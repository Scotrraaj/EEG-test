HISTORY:

This is a 37 y.o. right handed male admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: partial epilepsy.  Most seizures occur in the AM, with an aura.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Recording of seizures for presurgical evaluation.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;





CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The  spike and seizure detection computer program  was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

DAY 1 (8/22/2016,  - 8/23/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND:


The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric,  well-organized, and consists predominantly of
alpha with admixed theta on the left.



Posterior dominant rhythm was  9 Hz, symmetric, reactive present.





The background is  reactive,  variable.



There was an asymmetry in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep: Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic, bilateral theta, characteristic of hypnagogic
hypersynchrony. Stage II sleep was characterized by symmetric sleep spindles and/or K-complexes.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: In wakefulness, there is nearly continuous rhythmic left temporal theta



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

None

EVENTS: - NO clinical or electrographic events



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

No clinical seizures have been recorded yet.  The rhythmic left temporal slowing, and left temporal
sharply contoured slowing was previously described for this young adult.  It is typical of that seen in
temporal lobe epilepsy syndromes.

Hyperventilation produces generalized, rhythmic, relatively symmetric slowing.

Photic stimulation follows and elicits a bilateral driving response, more vigorous on the right.

EVENTS:

No  electrographic events reported or detected


18:45 PM- pt reports the next day that he felt like he "took a blue pill". EEG reviewed. Normal wake
pattern, patient awake, playing cards.  Seems to be not as talkative during part of this, and is relaxed
back in his chair, then resumes the game, but no impairment in awareness.  The video/behavior
could show response to internal stimuli or just responsiveness to the conversation.



06:00- same time frame searched for seizure- no definitive behavioral changes noted consistent with
the patient report and no electrographic seizure found.

Medicine reduction continues, Lyrica on hold


BACKGROUND: No change



GENERALIZED SLOWING: None


FOCAL SLOWING: No change



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare (<1hour) simple left temporal sharp waves, some bursts
irregular bitemporal slowing in sleep



Activation procedures: none




SEIZURE:

6:04 AM Duration 03:00  this seizure occurred out of sleep with an arousal.  The initial localization is
a bit unclear, but there is a clear arousal at 6:04:58 with fast activity present bilaterally but with
underlying rhythmic theta in the left temporal region.  At 8 seconds, the patient is clearly moving
about, looking for the seizure alarm and the EEG is then obscured by muscle. 6:05 , despite the
artifact, there is underlying rhythmic theta noted in the left hemisphere including left temporal and
left frontocentral region. There is evolution in frequency and amplitude with spread bilaterally at
6:05:51 and then the EEG is obscured by prominent tissue and oral automatisms.  At 6:06:17 the
EEG transitions to a tonic-clonic pattern, ending 06:07:18.  Although the EEG electrodes are quite
tenuous after the tonic-clonic activity, there is prolonged post ictal slowing.





CLINICAL: All seizures with motor component are stereotypic for this adult.  He arouses out of sleep,
at 6:05:10 heat looks to the left and pushes the button for the alarm.  He then looks over to the right
and has oral and bilateral manual automatisms.  He is fidgeting 20 seconds later when the nurse
enters the room.  He makes eye contact with her although he is not able to answer questions
correctly. He also mimics her motor behavior before going onto a tonic-clonic seizure.  Prior to the
tonic-clonic seizure, he is mimicking her hand movements with his left hand, the right hand is
motionless and he has prominent oral automatisms






EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60 BPM



DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

Single seizure out of sleep, with clinical characteristics typical of a temporal lobe seizure.  Despite
the underlying artifacts and other challenges, the seizure seems to originate from the left temporal
region.





DAY 6 (8/27/2016, 06:00 - 8/28/2016)

Medicine low dose resumes  Lyrica on hold

BACKGROUND: No change



GENERALIZED SLOWING: None

FOCAL SLOWING: No change


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None

SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare (<1hour) simple left temporal sharp waves, some bursts
irregular bitemporal slowing in sleep


Activation procedures: none




SEIZURES:






#1 1:47 AM, out of sleep- arousal followed by subtle fast activity in the left temporal region, 1:47:30-
though there is bilateral rhythmic theta, it seems to be maximal in the left temporal region.  Patient
is talking during the discharge but is confused, T1 Max  Seizure at 1:47:37 , prior to tonic-clonic
seizure with right arm extended left arm flexed and then prolonged postictal slowing



Clinical: he wakes up out of sleep, looks around turns to the left pushes the button on the left 1:47:16
, then he turns to the right stiffens.  He makes eye contact with an examiner.  He is interactive with his
mother and consolable but he has lip smacking movements.  He  turns to the right in a tonic-clonic
seizure.  The figure of 4 sign is noted in the tonic-clonic seizure with right arm extended left arm
flexed There is prolonged post ictal confusion with similar slowing in the EEG





#2 5:56 AM out of sleep- arousal followed by clear fast activity in the left temporal region, then
muscle artifact but rhythmic left temporal theta noted at 05:58.  There is clearly evolving theta delta
noted in the left temporal region, T1 maximum but also involving the left frontal central region.
Later, the EEG is obscured by muscle and motion artifact.  After the seizure, the patient drifts off to
sleep and there is left temporal focal slowing noted



Clinical: he wakes up out of sleep, looks around turns to the left pushes the button on the left 1:47:16
, then he turns to the right stiffens.  He makes eye contact with an examiner.  He is interactive with his
mother and consolable but he has lip smacking movements.


HR >120 BPM



#3: 10:13:30

Despite the long prodrome before the first electrographic change, this is the most clearly left
temporal seizure of the 4 seizures that were recorded.


An initial pattern of beta activity muscle and tachycardia gives way to rhythmic theta from the left
frontal region at 10:14:20.  The seizure ends with an evolution to delta frequency activity and high
amplitude left temporal spiking.  Prolonged postictal slowing was noted


CLINICAL: The patient's family is at the bedside.  They are able to identify the seizure before the first
scalp EEG change and in fact, leave the room looking for the staff to  assist the patient, at a time
with the EEG demonstrates a relatively normal awake pattern and slight tachycardia. The patient
looks for PB 10:14:00.  This is followed by lip smacking and impairment of awareness with the patient
turns to the right side where his mother is standing.  The mother states that she always stands on the
right side and that the patient is somewhat consolable during the seizures although he has difficulty
with verbal information and doesn't recall code word.




The patient received 2 mg Ativan after the seizure



# 4 15:35:39  PM , he demonstrates oral automatisms, L>R manual automaticisms, gestures with
hands, makes eye contact but is confused. Mother holds the r arm which may mask dystonic posture of
the motionless limb. He nods and smiles


EEG: Ictal pattern- characterized by initially a well-organized normal alpha rhythm followed by
tachycardia, disruption of the alpha rhythm, and increase in beta and a small amount of theta but no
definitive ictal pattern



CLINICAL: the patient is awake, relatively undressed in bed.  He turns red, takes off the covers, he
looks to the left for the push button.  He is clearly confused, but is interactive .  He did not recall the
code word.  This is the only seizure that differ substantially from the others and occurred in the
afternoon after 2 previous seizures and treatment with Ativan


EKG >120 BPM




EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60-120 BPM  BPM



DAY6 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

Multiple clinical seizures which begin with a typical complex partial seizures semiology and which
appear to localize to the left temporal region.  Clinical features of the seizures localized to the left
hemisphere including the figure of 4 sign and aphasia.


_______________________________________________________________________


Day 7- 8/28/2016- 6 AM to 1 PM

BACKGROUND: No change

FOCAL SLOWING: No change  intermittent left temporal rhythmic theta was noted


No additional seizures were noted on the final day of recording

Impression/clinical correlation: No seizures have been noted since 3 PM the day before.  Medications
were restarted and the patient was considered safe for discharge



___________________________________________________________


CONCLUSION:

Abnormal

#1 L TIRDA


#2 Infrequent L temporal sharp F7/T1

3. Multiple seizures described below

3a. Auras or SPS- one without clear clinical correlate and without EEG change.  Another, with clear
clinical change, visible to others but without definitive ictal pattern


3b. CPS, total 4, including one out of sleep. The first two were recorded with medication
cessation/re-load and had TC component.  One was out of sleep. All wake seizures had long
prodrome with out scalp change, but later T1 maxium, discernable under significant muscle artifact.
For wake seizures, patient was able to find the push  button, and was able to speak early in the
seizure, then had automatic speech and then ictal aphasia.  Family identified ictal behavior before
the patient, in fact before the first scalp EEG change (+ Mom sign) .




3bi: Duration of time before first EEG/ clinical change -can be as long as 30 seconds, if mother is at
bedside
