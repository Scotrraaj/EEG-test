DATE OF STUDY: 09/12/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 27 y.o. female with a history of peri-partum seizures referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

Oxytocin (PITOCIN) 20 Units in lactated ringers 1000 mL infusion

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) tablet 600 mg


bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) EC tablet 5 mg

docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg

magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL


prenatal Vit Comb.10-Iron-FA (VITAFOL-OB) 65-1 mg tablet 1 tablet

simethicone (MYLICON) chewable tablet 80 mg

alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL


ferrous sulfate tablet 325 mg

ammonia inhaler 0.3 mL



enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet 1 tablet


ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg

oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet 2 tablet





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 systemn with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.

No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:





This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
