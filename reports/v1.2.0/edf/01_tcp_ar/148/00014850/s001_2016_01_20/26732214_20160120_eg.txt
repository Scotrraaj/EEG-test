History:	69 year old man with a history of a prior stroke and seizures, now presents after a 
	suspected focal seizure.
Medications:	CARBAMAZEPINE, Topamax, Neurontin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, drowsy, asleep
Description:
There is no clear PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic 
moderate amplitude theta and delta activity with occasional polymorphic alpha activity.  
Continuous polymorphic often sharply contoured delta activity is captured over left temporal region,
 most pronounced over T3 lead.  Subtle underriding faster frequencies are captured over the left 
midtemporal region.  During sleep, sleep spindles are seen.  They are higher in amplitude over the
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart 
rate of ~45 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, moderate-to-severe
	Breach artifact, left temporal, mid
	Sleep, stage 2
	No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal awake and asleep portable 27 minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing 
and continuous moderate-to-severe focal slowing over the left temporal region. Diffuse slowing is 
indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous 
focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the left temporal region.  Breach artifact 
is secondary to a skull defect.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~45 bpm.
