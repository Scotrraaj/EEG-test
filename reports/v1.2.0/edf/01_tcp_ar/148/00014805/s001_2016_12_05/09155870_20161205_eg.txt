HISTORY:

38 y.o. male with a history of anoxic brain injury and septic shock, who remains
unresponsive with gaze deviation towards the right.

SEDATION: None- stopped ~3 hours prior to the EEG.



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:



There is no PDR or AP gradient.


The background consists of a burst-suppression pattern, with burst to suppression ratio of ~ 1:1-1.5.
Bursts are ~1-2 seconds long.  The activity within the bursts is stereotyped and consists of frontally
predominant generalized waveforms of triphasic morphology that are accompanied by lower
amplitude polymorphic theta activity.





No normal sleep architecture is captured.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:

There is persistent gaze deviation throughout the study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to:


1. 1:1-1:1.5 burst-suppression pattern

2. Lack of the background reactivity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is etiologically nonspecific.


There is persistent gaze deviation throughout the study that has no ictal correlate.



No electrographic seizures are captured.
