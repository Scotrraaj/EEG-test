HISTORY: 53 y.o. male with who was transferred from Suburban Community Hospital for progressing AMS and tonic posture concerning for seizures. He was initially admitted for bradycardia and hypothermia, and was previously on risperidone, which was held at the outside hospital. He is referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events of altered mental status and tonic posturing.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg thiamine tablet 100 mg gabapentin (NEURONTIN) capsule 300 mg risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) tablet 2 mg levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 750 mg lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 20 mg clonazePAM (KLONOPIN) tablet 1 mg amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg benztropine (COGENTIN) tablet 0.5 mg ARIPiprazole (ABILIFY) tablet 20 mg tamsulosin (FLOMAX) 24 hr capsule 0.4 mg folic acid (FOLVITE) tablet 1 mg aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg   SEDATION: received 1 mg, then 2 more mg Ativan during study due to consistent muscle artifact  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record due to near-continue diffuse muscle artifact. The study included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/5/2016, 19:34 - 11/6/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: This a very technically challenging record to interpret.  At study start, the background is nearly completely obscured by diffuse muscle artifact. During brief (<20 sec) periods of muscle artifact attenuation, the background consists of diffuse alpha with excess beta and delta activity, and no definite posterior dominant rhythm. During the first 30 min, there is a suggestion of rhythmic slowing and sharply contoured right frontal activity, but this is difficult to fully define in the setting of muscle artifact, which is especially prominent over the left hemisphere, obscuring interpretation over this area. As the study progresses, this asymmetry is no longer apparent.  Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by increasing prevalence of theta and delta. There are no well-defined sleep transients.  There is mild-moderate generalized slowing. No definite sustained focal slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Abundant, near continuous, diffuse muscle artifact.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None definite  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in 60s-80s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal, limited, long term video EEG due to: 1. Mild to moderate diffuse slowing with suboptimal organization 2. Excess beta and delta activity in wake  These findings are indicative of a mild-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, etiologically nonspecific. Excess beta can be seen in the setting of benzodiazepines and barbiturates.  The suggestion of rhythmic slowing and sharply contoured activity over the right hemisphere noted at the beginning of the study was not seen as the study progressed and is of unclear significance, though artifact activity is favored.    -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (11/6/2016, 06:00 - 11/7/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: mild-moderate  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): continued periods of abundant muscle artifact, as on day 1  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured in the 70s-90s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change compared with day 1. No focal slowing or epileptiform activity.   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (11/7/2016, 06:00 - 11/7/2016, 08:58)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): continued periods of abundant muscle artifact, as on days 1-2  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in 70s-90s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change compared with days 1-2.

Mild to moderate diffuse slowing with suboptimal organization 2. Excess beta and delta activity in wake   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are indicative of a mild-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, etiologically nonspecific. Excess beta can be seen in the setting of benzodiazepines and barbiturates.  The suggestion of rhythmic slowing and sharply contoured activity over the right hemisphere noted at the beginning of the study was not seen as the study progressed that day, nor on subsequent days, and is of unclear significance, though artifact activity is favored.
