History:	36 year old woman with a history of seizures.
Medications:	Keppra, Depakote, Klonopin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8-8.5 Hz.  The AP gradient is weak and there is excess 
polymorphic theta activity.  During drowsiness, the degree of diffuse theta activity increases and 
brief periods of backgroudn discontinuity are captured.
  Two moderate amplitude right midtemporal (T4 maximal) sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves
 are captured during drowsiness.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
	Sharp waves, two, right temporal, mid, T4 maximal, during drowsiness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and two right 
midtemporal epileptiform discharges. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral 
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  There is a potentially epileptogenic focus over the 
right midtemporal region.
