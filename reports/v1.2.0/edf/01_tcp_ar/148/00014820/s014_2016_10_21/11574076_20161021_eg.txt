SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by symmetric and reactive 8.5-9 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). Prominent medium amplitude central beta activity is seen along with superimposed
muscle, EKG, and frontal eye blink artifact.




During drowsiness, slow attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves and
increased generalized delta activity.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:







Occasional (1/hour to <1min) generalized bursts of paroxysmal fast activity followed by 3/s polyspike
and wave discharges were seen. These lasted 1-3 seconds and there were no associated clinical signs
seen.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Occasional bursts of 3/s polyspike and wave activity preceded by generalized paroxysmal fast
activity.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a projected generalized irritative disturbance typically seen
in association with one of the primary generalized epilepsies.
