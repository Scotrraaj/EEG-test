HISTORY:

This is a 41 y.o.  female undergoing continuous inpatient video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: refractory epilepsy.  Patient had multiple unusual seizures on the day
prior to this recording.





Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Characterization of seizures.


Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:


- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.


- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;







- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:


A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.  **
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The spike and seizure detection computer program  was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

DAY 1 (8/22/2016- 8/23/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND:



The waking background is continuous,  symmetric,  and consists predominantly of theta with scant 8
Hz alpha rhythm

Posterior dominant rhythm was  present.



The background is  reactive,  variable.

There were  no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.


Sleep was characterized by  symmetric sleep spindles and/or K-complexes.

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Spike and wave, slow spike and wave and polyspike and wave
complexes were identified.  They're much more prominent in sleep



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

EVENTS: in sleep electrographic events were detected.  Some examples are characterized below

14:16 4-5 seconds of 2-3 Hz frontally predominant polyspike and slow wave activity


16:58 5 seconds of 2.5 Hz frontally predominant polyspike and slow wave activity.  Patient seems to
be asleep, head turn to the right in bed

Additional discharges, similar all in sleep; without clinical correlate.


21:32: slow spike and wave, polyspike wave of ,2.0 Hz, 2 bursts spanning  10 seconds

DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Markedly abnormal study due to:


Slow background

Slow spike and wave activity

Poly spike and wave activity.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 2 (8/23/2016, 06:00 - 8/24/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND: No change, alpha rhythm reaches 9 Hz. Patient more consistently wake (Percocet
reduced)



GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change



FOCAL SLOWING: None



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: as above, almost exclusively in sleep brief bursts of poly
spike and slow activity or GPFA, Bursts less than 5 seconds





EVENTS:


#1 2:32 AM out of sleep, feeling of dizzy, like she had a seizure-EEG pattern drowsy  Then wake,
Normal wake behavior, though soft spoken.


#2:4:16 AM  17 second slow spike wave- patient wakened by clinical team which seems to end the
discharge. No clinical features noted.



EKG: A single EKG lead captured NSR




DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

No clear clinical seizures but frequent bursts s/w polyspike and wave in sleep


-----------------------------------------------------------------

Meds: LTG reduced, Zon added

BACKGROUND: Remained normal

GENERALIZED SLOWING: None


FOCAL SLOWING: Remained normal

SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Occasional  similar to prior days with frontal spike and wave
and poly spike wave


EVENTS: none

EKG: A single EKG lead captured 72 BPM
