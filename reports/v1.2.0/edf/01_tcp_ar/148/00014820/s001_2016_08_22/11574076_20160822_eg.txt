HISTORY:

41 y.o. female with a history of multiple seizures referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:



Facility-Administered Medications Ordered in Other Visits:

docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg


ferrous sulfate tablet 325 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

[START ON 8/23/2016] enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 2,000 mg

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) tablet 200 mg



oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet 1 tablet




TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) frontal predominant generalized paroxysmal fast activities and
generalized symmetric polyspike and wave seen at 4 Hz frequency. The bursts last 1-2 seconds and
no clinical correlate is seen with them.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.






IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Frequent frontal predominant symmetric generalized polyspike and waves present.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


The normal EEG background along with the history of seizures and generalized polyspike and waves
are consistent with the diagnosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.
