HISTORY:

41 y.o. female with a history of medically refractory epilepsy, with 5 staring spells in
the ED referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) tablet 200 mg


levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 2,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

SEDATION:Ativan, total of 4 mg



TECHNIQUE:

A STAT bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.
Recording time was abbreviated because of the need to move the patient to the floor. Patient was
drowsy but answered most questions correctly.







EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep included vertex waves and spindles


No generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: abundant frontally predominant  4HZ spike and wave activity was seen
in relaxed wakefullness/early drowsy with bursts <2.5 sec in duration and without definitive loss of
awareness.  In sleep bursts of polyspike or generalized fast activity are also seen, <4 sec in duration,
alleviated by stimulation




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  See above


EVENTS:

There are no clinical  events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Spike and wave and generalized fast activity, clearly augmented in sleep



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are identical to prior recording in August 2016.  The patient will go on to EMU as
discussed with the on call team.
