HISTORY:

41 y.o. female with a history of medically refractory epilepsy  referred for EEG for
evaluation of paroxysmal events.  Recent complan of increasing pain and opiod use.



MEDICATIONS:

No current facility-administered medications for this encounter.

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 325 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours as needed for up
to 10 days.


nitrofurantoin, macrocrystal-monohydrate, (MACROBID) 100 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth
every 12 hours for 10 days.

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 50 mg tablet, Take 3 tablets by mouth every 12 hours for 360 days.
Indications: TONIC-CLONIC EPILEPSY


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 6 hours as needed for Pain
for up to 10 days. Take 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours.


lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 20 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth daily for 360 days.




lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 200 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily for 360 days.

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 600 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 6 hours as needed for Pain.



TECHNIQUE:

Continuous video EEG monitor 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and seizure and spike detection
.




DAY 1 (12/10/2016,  - 12/11/2016, 15:00)



BACKGROUND:

The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric,  well-organized, and consists predominantly of
Alpha and beta with admixed scant theta.



Posterior dominant rhythm was  Present- 10 Hz.




The background is  reactive,  variable.



There were  no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.


Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured..



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Occasional (1/hour to <1min) brief bursts spike and wave or poly spike wave, GPFA seen primarily in
sleep



EVENTS: None


EKG: A single lead captured 90 BPM






DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:


Spike and wave, polyspike and wave activity and GPFA seen almost exclusively in sleep as is typical
for this patient.


All bursts are brief, as has been seen in prior LTM EEG studies.

In comparison to other EEGS there is less epileptiform activity.
