HISTORY:

23 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ, ONSET AGE 13 ( HEAD INJURY
PLAYING FOOTBALL ) PT HAS AN AURA OF NAUSEA. REPORTS STARRING SPELL EVERY
OTHER WEEK / 1 X A WEEK. LAST SZ X 1 WEEK AGO.




MEDICATIONS:

zonisamide (ZONEGRAN) 100 mg capsule, Take 2 capsules by mouth 2 times daily.


divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 3 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present at T4 during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Intermittent sharp waves were seen at F8 and T4 in sleep.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Right fronto-temporal and mid-temporal sharp waves in sleep


2. Intermittent focal slowing in the midtemporal region.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG due to right fronto-temporal and mid-temporal
sharp waves. This is indicative of potentially epileptogenic foci in these regions. In addition there is
intermittent focal slowing in the right midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
