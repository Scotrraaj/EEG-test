HISTORY:


64 y.o. male with a history of COPD, methadone use, VDRF with shaking spell on
July 23, 2016 referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

Azithromycin, Methadone



SEDATION: Precedex, Fentanyl, Ativan


TECHNIQUE:


A  Portable continuous video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation. Patient
was intubated and poorly responsive.







DAY 1 ( 7/24/2016 )



BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous,  symmetric,  and consists predominantly of lower voltage delta
with admixed theta.  Eye opening is not associated with a PDR but there is a bit more theta at that
time. Later sections of the record demonstrate more movement and more theta activity.




Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.

Eye opening was noted at 8 AM



The background is reactive, it is variable.


There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was  Not otherwise defined.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



EVENTS: None. Stimulatin produces an increase in theta, particularly later in the record.


EKG: A single lead captured HR 80-93 BPM



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:


Initially marked background slowing, improving as sedation was reduced.    This pattern is non-
specific but supports a bi-hemispheric cerebral disturbance. Correlation with exam and imaging is
suggested.
