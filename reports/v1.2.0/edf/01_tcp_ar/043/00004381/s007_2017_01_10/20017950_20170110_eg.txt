HISTORY: 31 y.o. female with a history of TC seizures since age 16 referred for EEG for characterization of seizures.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet  topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet   TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.   DAY 1 (1/6/2017, 11:47 - 1/7/2017, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of alpha with admixed beta. There is occasional excess theta and rare excess delta activity in wake. Posterior dominant rhythm was present at 10 Hz. The background is reactive and variable. There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Central theta of drowsiness was seen.  Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was present and normal.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:   ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.   EVENTS: no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured 90 BPM   DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This long term video EEG is remarkable for: 1. Occasional excess theta and rare excess delta in wake     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (1/7/2017, 06:00 - 1/8/2017, 06:00)  AEDs:  Keppra reduced to 500 q12h Topamax continued at 200 q12h  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Patient sleep deprived until 1/8 03:00  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s-70s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change No events     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (1/8/2017, 06:00 - 1/9/2017, 06:00)  AEDs:  Keppra reduced to 250 AM, 0 HS Topamax continued at 200 q12h  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Patient sleep deprived until 1/9 03:00  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s-70s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION No change No events    -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 4 (1/9/2017, 06:00 - 1/10/2017, 06:00)  AEDs:  Keppra OFF Topamax reduced to 100 q12h  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s-70s   DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION No change No events     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 5 (1/10/2017, 06:00 - 1/11/2017, 06:00)  AEDs:  Keppra OFF Topamax OFF  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  1/10 at 15:45: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.  1/10 at 15:53: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.  Patient is sleep deprived until 1/11 at 0:300.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s-70s   DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION No change No events   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 6 (1/11/2017, 06:00 - 1/11/2017, 12:02)  AEDs:  Keppra OFF Topamax OFF  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s-70s   DAY 6 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION No change No events     -----------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:   INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient’s interictal findings were significant for occasional excess theta and rare bursts of excess delta in wakefulness.  There were no definite admixed interictal discharges within these bursts of slowing. Otherwise, there was a normal posterior dominant rhythm, 10 Hz, without any focal findings.   ICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient did not have any clinical events.     SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:  1. No seizures captured  EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:  1. No seizures captured  CONCLUSION:  The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 6 days with continuous video EEG.  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of events.  The patient was weaned off Keppra and Topamax over the course of her admission. She was restarted on her medications on the day prior to her discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes were made during the hospitalization.
