HISTORY:


78 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy memory loss and gait disorder
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.

Adult onset epilepsy, past heavy EtOH.


MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.


phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 2 capsules by mouth nightly.

FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE (FLUTICASONE NA), by Nasal route as needed.

amoxicillin (AMOXIL) 500 mg capsule, Take 875 mg by mouth daily.


aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.

glipiZIDE (GLUCOTROL) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth 2 times daily (before meals).

simvastatin (ZOCOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth nightly.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Murhythm was
identified, but testing was not performed to confirm this







Sleep is not captured



Minimal generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  Irregular,  Paced beats




IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. very mildly slow alpha rhythm for an adult of this age



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are nonspecific.  There were no epileptiform features identified.  The overall
background is well-organized
