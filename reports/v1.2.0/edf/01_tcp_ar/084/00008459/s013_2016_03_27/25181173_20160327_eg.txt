START DATE OF STUDY: 03/23/16 at 2:23:11PM END DATE OF STUDY: 03/27/16 at 10:00:AM  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Epilepsy Monitoring Unit EEG TYPE: Long term recording   HISTORY: a 31 y.o. right handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.     Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.  Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons: - The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate. - Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus; - The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;   - The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient’s exam  (9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service  CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.  Additionally, T1 and T2 electrodes were placed in this patient.  Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.   Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.    The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.    MEDICATIONS: Current Outpatient Prescriptions: lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 150 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. folic acid (FOLVITE) 1 mg tablet, Take 4 tablets by mouth daily. PNV CMB#95/FERROUS FUMARATE/FA (PRENATAL MULTIVITAMINS PO), Take  by mouth daily.  No current facility-administered medications for this visit.   SEDATION: None  DAY 1 (3/23/16, 2:23:11PM - 03/24/2016, 06:00AM)  BACKGROUND:  The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of alpha and beta.   Posterior dominant rhythm was 9-10 Hz and reactive to eye opening.   The background is reactive, variable.  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Sleep was characterized by slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm, symmetric sleep spindles and/or K-complexes.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present   ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.       Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.       Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.   EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a normal 24 hour video-EEG.

No clinical events were captured.    -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (03/25/16, 06:00 - 03/26/16, 06:00)  AEDs: NONE  INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reaches 9-10 Hz.  Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.
