DATE OF STUDY: 03/23/2016

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only



HISTORY:

 a 31 y.o. female with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 200 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth


nightly.

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily

(with breakfast). May convert to 100 BID with next dose reduction


Lacosamide (VIMPAT) 150 mg Tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every

12 hours.

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 100 mg tablet, 1/2 tab nightly  For 14


days, then 1/2 BID

TRI-ESTARYLLA 0.18/0.215/0.25 mg-35 mcg (28) tablet,

folic acid (FOLVITE) 1 mg tablet, Take 3 tablets by mouth daily.


(Patient taking differently: Take 4 mg by mouth daily.)




PNV CMB#95/FERROUS FUMARATE/FA (PRENATAL MULTIVITAMINS PO), Take

by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5-10


Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



Patient remains awake throughout the recording.


Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with fair cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake only 24-minute routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake only 24-minute routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.


No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not

recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep


recording may provide additional information.
