DATE OF STUDY: 05/11/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:
a 61 y.o. male with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 600 mg tablet, Take 600 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for Pain.


multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, 2 tablets BID


baclofen (LIORESAL) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth 3 times daily.

citalopram (CELEXA) 20 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.


ZOSTAVAX 19,400 unit/0.65 mL injection, inject contents of 1 vial subcutaneously

hydrocortisone 0.5 % cream, Apply  topically 2 times daily.

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.


ranitidine (ZANTAC) 150 mg tablet, Take 150 mg by mouth 2 times daily.




naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).

folic acid (FOLVITE) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth daily.


thiamine 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background consists of very low amplitude diffuse beta activity.



During drowsiness, diffuse theta activity appears.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  Occasional premature QRS complexes are
seen.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.


Occasional premature QRS complexes are seen on a single EKG lead.
