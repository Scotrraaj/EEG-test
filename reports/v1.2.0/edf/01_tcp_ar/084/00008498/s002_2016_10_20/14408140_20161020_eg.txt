HISTORY:

49 y.o. male with a history of right thalamic hemorrhage, EVD, and previous right
sided stroke referred for routine EEG for follow-up.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 100 mg capsule, Take 100 mg by mouth every 8 hours.

amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.

simvastatin (ZOCOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth nightly.

traZODone (DESYREL) 150 mg tablet, Take 150 mg by mouth nightly.



acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 325 mg tablet, Take 650 mg by mouth every 4 hours as needed for

TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation. Patient has a right craniotomy defect.
Patient was agitated and at times uncooperative.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is disorganized.  There is a symmetric mixture of theta, alpha, and beta
frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During minimal drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the
posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Shifting focal slowing is present with irregular delta activity seen in the right and occasionally the left.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized background slowing and disorganization.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

No epileptiform features were seen.


These findings may be correlated with imaging.
