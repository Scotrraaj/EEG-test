DATE OF STUDY: 04/28/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 29 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.


Seizure types:

Type 1 CPS - She feels an electric sensation running up the right leg and then lifts the right arm with
stiffening and stares for seconds. When it is over she has a headache and screams. 50% occur during
sleep (used to be mainly in sleep) or while waking up. 2 per week.


Type 2 T-C: Last 04/2014 prior 01/2014 (she was not taking vimpat).


MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray, Inhale 1 spray into the nose daily.


busPIRone (BUSPAR) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

ARIPiprazole (ABILIFY) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily.

VIMPAT 200 mg Tablet,


phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule,

tiZANidine (ZANAFLEX) 4 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily. For neck stiffness/pain.
May use 3 times daily


ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 800 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours as needed for Pain.



divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 500 mg EC tablet, TAKE 3 TABLETS BY MOUTH EVERY MORNING AND
3 TABLETS AT NIGHT


clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 1 mg disintegrating tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.

chlorproMAZINE (THORAZINE) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


asenapine (SAPHRIS) 5 mg Subl, Place 5 mg under the tongue 2 times daily.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
systemwith T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by generalized slowing with relatively symmetric mixture of
theta, alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive  7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. Likley
Lambda is present (HV)




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  Occipitally predominant slowing is seen,
with isolated delta waves in R occipital parietal region.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
POSTS sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Modest generalized slowing is present.

Subtle focal slowing is present, in drowsiness only. An asymmetry in the Posterior regions was noted



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:




Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Excess theta

2. Poor organization


3. Subtle focal features, noted only in drowsiness


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findingsare frequently found in association with a mild or diffuse CNS disturbance.  No
epileptiform features seen.
