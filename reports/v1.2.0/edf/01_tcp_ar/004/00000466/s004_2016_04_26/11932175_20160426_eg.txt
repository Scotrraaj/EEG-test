DATE OF STUDY: 04/26/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only





HISTORY:

a 41 y.o. male with a history of seizures (last in), referred for routine EEG
for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 500 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. Indications:
EPILEPSY

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and an excess
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only routine EEG, remarkable only for excess of beta frequencies.  There are
no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.



If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.

Excess beta activity may be seen in the setting of a medication effect (i.e., benzodiazepines,
barbiturates).
