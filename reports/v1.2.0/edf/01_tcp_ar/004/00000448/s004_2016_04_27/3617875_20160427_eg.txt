DATE OF STUDY: 04/27/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 49 y.o. male with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 300 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.


emtricitabine-tenofovir (TRUVADA) 200-300 mg per tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH DAILY

raltegravir (ISENTRESS) 400 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH TWICE DAILY

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule,


Condoms Latex Lubricated Device, 1 box by Misc.(Non-Drug; Combo Route) route daily. Use as
directed
ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 800 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours as needed for Pain.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11-11.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


Continuous polymorphic sharply contoured theta and delta activity is captured over the left anterior
quadrant.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) moderate amplitude sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves are
captured over the left anterior temporal region- central region (T3/C3 maximal)





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.






IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Continuous moderate left anterior quadrant focal slowing

2. Intermittent left anterior temporal- central epileptiform discharges (T3/C3 max)



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

There is focal structural potentially epileptogenic cerebral abnormality over the left anterior quadrant.



Similar findings were reported 2013 and 2014 EEGs.
