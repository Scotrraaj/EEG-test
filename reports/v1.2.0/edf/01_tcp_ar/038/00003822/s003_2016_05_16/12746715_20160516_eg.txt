DATE OF STUDY: 05/16/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 58 y.o. WOMAN PT WITH CC OF INCREASE IN SEIZURES.



MEDICATIONS:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet,

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 25 mg tablet,



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional bursts of symmetric frontal predominant generalized spike and wave discharges at 4Hz
lasting up to 3 seconds are seen. No clinical correlate with any of them.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



1. Generalized spike and wave 4hz



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to fast generalized spike an wave
discharges. These findings are frequently found in association with generalized epilepsy.
