HISTORY:

75 y.o. male with a history of CVA (with right hemiparesis, 2007), HTN, and
pacemaker who presented with dizziness that has resolved, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of
paroxysmal events.




MEDICATIONS: home meds include warfarin, ASA, coreg, atorvastatin, hydralazine,




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:








The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
low voltage alpha and beta frequencies, with fragments of a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is present but suboptimal.




During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. A low
voltage background may represent a normal variant in the adult population.
