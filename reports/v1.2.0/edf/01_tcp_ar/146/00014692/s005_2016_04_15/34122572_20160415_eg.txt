HISTORY: 60 y.o. female with a history of medically refractory seizures, now comes with several breakthrough seizures and subsequent severe somnolence, concern for subclinical seizures.    MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Depakote  SEDATION: Ativan  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (~15 hours)  BACKGROUND: Patient is asleep throughout most of the study.  During brief periods of arousals, the background consists a mixture of diffuse beta activity with under riding delta activity.  Sleep is characterized by attenuated and discontinuous background with symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles seen.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  A single frontally predominant generalized sharp wave is captured.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captures heart rate of ~ 84 bpm.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal ~15 hour long term video EEG due to:  Mild diffuse slowing.  This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  In this patient it could be related to excessive somnolence.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2  BACKGROUND: more frequent and sustained periods of arousals are present.  There is increase in theta and alpha activity.   FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Occasional (1/hour to <1min) high amplitude left anterior temporal spikes with after going slow waves are seen during sleep (T1 maximal).  Additionally, independent occasional generalized broad frontally predominant sharp waves are seen during sleep (examples at 3:29:43 AM, 7:55:08 AM on 4/16/2016).  They at times occur in brief non-evolving runs.  EVENTS: None  EKG: A single EKG lead captures heart rate of ~ 80 bpm   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  This is an abnormal 24 hour recording due to: (1) mild diffuse slowing (2) occasional left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges (3) occasional generalized frontally predominant epileptiform discharges.  Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  There at 2 independent potentially epileptogenic foci: left anterior region and likely frontal (unclear right or left, suspect secondary bisynchrony) region.
