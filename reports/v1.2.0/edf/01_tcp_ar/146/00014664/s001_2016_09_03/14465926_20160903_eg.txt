DATE OF STUDY: 09/03/16 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:  EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only   HISTORY: a 48 y.o. male with a history of depression, polypharmacy, seizures referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change. Presented:  48 yom w/ Hx HTN presenting via EMS for stroke alert. EMS was called because patient was witnessed to fall and have LOC. Immediately afterward EMS noted left sided weakness and possibly a facial droop. Patient brought to Temple ED w/ time since stroke team assembled being ~1hr. In ED patient stating that he felt numb and weak on his left side. He notes having a seizure in December 2016 but this was different. Then was sedated for agitation.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: divalproex (DEPAKOTE DR) tablet 500 mg aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 10 mg Klonopin, others as OP  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A bedside   Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verba;  stimulation.  EEG BACKGROUND: The background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, the patient arouses just once with a burst of alpha activity .  During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:see above   EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is a normal sleep EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.The somnolence may be medication effect.   .
