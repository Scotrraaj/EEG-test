HISTORY: 48 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy since childhood referred for EEG for management of seizure exacerbation and treatment of status epilepticus.  MEDICATIONS: Keppra 1500 mg q12h, s/p 2000 mg load   SEDATION: propofol  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (6/20/2016, 00:00 - 6/20/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, poorly-organized, reactive. Most of the record consists predominantly of delta with superimposed beta. During stimulation, the background briefly reacts with increased predominance of theta and alpha.  There is no posterior dominant rhythm. Well-formed sleep transients are not seen.  There is moderate to severe generalized slowing.   PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) bifrontal spike-and-wave (Fp1, Fp2 maximum, with higher amplitude consistently over Fp2) 2. Occasional left fronto-temporal (T1>F7/T3/Fp1/F3) spike-and-wave 3. Occasional bitemporal (right max) (T2>T1) sharp waves  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 90s.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and background disorganization, which may at least in part be due to propofol 2. Multifocal epileptiform discharges as above No clinical or electrographic seizures are reported or detected.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (6/20/2016, 06:00 - 6/20/2016, 16:00)  BACKGROUND:  Patient becomes more awake beginning around 6/20 07:20. Wakefulness consists of low voltage fast frequency background with excess theta and delta frequencies. Posterior dominant rhythm consists of low voltage fast frequencies. Patient is extubated around this time.  During drowsiness, bursts of rhythmic delta are seen. Sleep not yet captured on this day.  Study is disconnected at 6/20 14:16. At 6/20 14:41 only leads over left hemisphere are reconnected.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: mild  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s.   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Improvement in degree of background slowing from moderate-to-severe to mild. Epileptiform discharges not seen during this day, which mostly consists of wakefulness.      -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and background disorganization, improving to mild generalized slowing by day 2 2. Multifocal epileptiform discharges, seen on day 1 and resolving during wakeful state during day 2:     a) Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) bifrontal spike-and-wave (Fp1, Fp2 maximum, with higher amplitude consistently over Fp2)     b) Occasional left fronto-temporal (T1>F7/T3/Fp1/F3) spike-and-wave     c) Occasional bitemporal (right max) (T2>T1) sharp waves   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of multifocal epileptogenic discharges superimposed on diffuse cerebral dysfunction. The cerebral dysfunction is at least in part related to propofol and may also be indicative of a postictal state that has improved by day 2.
