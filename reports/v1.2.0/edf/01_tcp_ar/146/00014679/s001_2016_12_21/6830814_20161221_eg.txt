SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is a large amount of diffuse overwhelming EMG artifact.  This artifact is especially pronounced
over the bilateral lateral leads and is present for nearly the entirety of the recording.



Once EMG artifact improves, the visualized background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta
and delta activity and occasional triphasics waveforms.





Patient remains awake throughout the recording.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None clearly


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:

A single EKG lead demonstrates regular heart rate with widened and broad QRS complexes



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing

2. Occasional triphasics waveforms



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Overall the study is limited due to excessive EMG artifact, especially over the lateral EEG leads
(primarily temporal lobe coverage).  So epileptiform discharges and seizures could have been
missed.


Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.



Triphasic waves are a nonspecific EEG finding that can be seen in encephalopathy (mostly
commonly hepatic), uremia, anoxia and many other etiologies.
