HISTORY:

59 y.o. male who presented with a likely

seizure in the setting of tramadol use and Na of 128, referred


for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.


MEDICATIONS: None



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a


fairly organized symmetric mixture of mostly theta frequencies,

with admixed delta and alpha. There is a symmetric and reactive


6-6.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is

present but suboptimal.



During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior

dominant rhythm, and further background slowing are seen.



Sleep transients are not captured.


Moderate generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving (most


prominent at 5 and 7 flashes per second), which is a normal

finding.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of moderate diffuse cerebral


dysfunction.
