HISTORY: 

52 y.o. male with a history of CHF with EF 30%, HTN, DM, CAD, prior CVA (details unknown) who is referred for routine EEG for an evaluation of an episode in which he passed out, hit his head, then became agitated, and was found to be moving the LUE less.  

MEDICATIONS: 

Current Outpatient Prescriptions: 

carvedilol (COREG) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth 2 times daily (with meals). 

furosemide (LASIX) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth 2 times daily. 

ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet, Take 325 mg by mouth daily (with breakfast). 

CHROM PICO/BRINDAL BERRY (GARCINIA CAMBOGIA PO), Take 500 mg by mouth daily. 

GINKGO BILOBA PO, Take 300 mg by mouth daily. 

isosorbide mononitrate (IMDUR) 30 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. 

furosemide (LASIX) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth daily.

Takes in addition to 20mg TABS for total of 60mg daily insulin glargine (LANTUS) 100 unit/mL injection, Inject 30 Units into the skin nightly. 

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. 

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.  

SEDATION:

patient received Versed prior to the study  

TECHNIQUE: 

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  

EEG BACKGROUND: 

   The background consists only of drowsiness. Drowsiness consists of a mixture of alpha and bifrontal beta, with slow rolling eye movements. Stimulation by the technician results in a brief arousal and reactivity is present, but there is no clear posterior dominant rhythm and wakefulness is not sustained. Sleep transients are not captured.  There is no definite generalized slowing, though this cannot fully be assessed in the sedated state. No focal slowing is present.   

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  

EVENTS: 

   There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  

HEART RATE: 

   A heart rate of 80 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  

IMPRESSION / CLINICAL CORRELATION: 

   This is an essentially normal routine EEG captured in the drowsy, medicated state. There are no focal features. However, the presence or absence of generalized slowing cannot be fully assessed as the study was performed after the patient received versed, resulting in a drowsy background. There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected. This routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
