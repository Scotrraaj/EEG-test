DATE OF STUDY: 01/18/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 33 y.o. female with a history of seizures, black outs, migraines, and dizziness. Last
seizure was 2 1/2  weeks ago



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. Disp 90 days


Amphetamine-Dextroamphetamine (ADDERALL) 20 mg Tablet, TK 1 T PO BID

hydrOXYzine hcl (ATARAX) 25 mg tablet, TK 1 T PO  Q 8 HOURS PRN

trazodone (DESYREL) 150 mg tablet, TK 1 T PO QHS


AMITIZA 8 mcg capsule,

DEXTROAMPHETAMINE/AMPHETAMINE (ADDERALL PO), Take 10 mg by mouth 4 times daily.

alprazolam (XANAX) 2 mg tablet, Take 2 mg by mouth 4 times daily.


venlafaxine (EFFEXOR-XR) 150 mg 24 hr capsule, Take 150 mg by mouth daily.

risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) 3 mg tablet, Take 3 mg by mouth 2 times daily.



fluticasone-salmeterol (ADVAIR DISKUS) 250-50 mcg/dose diskus inhaler, Inhale 1 puff into the lungs
2 times daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.






EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1. Normal awake and drowsy



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG.

No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
