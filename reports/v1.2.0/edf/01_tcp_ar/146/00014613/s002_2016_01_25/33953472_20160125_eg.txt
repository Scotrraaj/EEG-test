HISTORY:

a 32 y.o. FEMALE WITH SZ FALL/STIFFENING/SHAKING

X30 SEC. (PT HAD FEBRILE SZS AS BABY.  PER PT HAS BEEN PASSING


OUT X1 YR.  ALSO USES XANAX STOPPED WK PRIOR.


MEDICATIONS:


PERCOCET, DILAUDID, ALPRAZOLAM, BENADRYL, EFFEXOR, ADDERAL




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The limited waking background is characterized by the presence of

a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies,


with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm

(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present. Excess beta is present diffusely.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


The record is mainly in sleep which is characterized by normal

sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,


sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. Excessive beta

activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as


benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
