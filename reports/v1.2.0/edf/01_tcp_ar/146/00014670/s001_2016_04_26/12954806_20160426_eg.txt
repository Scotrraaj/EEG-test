DATE OF STUDY: 04/26/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep





HISTORY:

a 69 y.o. female with a history of seizures, COPD, and severe back pain referred for
routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS: Dilantin



SEDATION: none


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The majority of the study consists of drowsiness and sleep.

During brief periods of wakefulness, fragments of an irregular posterior dominant rhythm approaching
7 Hz are seen in an anterior to posterior gradient that is present but suboptimal.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric sleep spindles.
Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Occasional sharply contoured waves are seen independently over the bilateral temporal regions, not
clearly epileptiform.




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may at least in
part be associated with a suboptimally awake state.
