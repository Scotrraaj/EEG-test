HISTORY: 71 y.o. WOMAN WITH IOM EEG FOR PTE.  MEDICATIONS: Induction med: ISO Flurane, Versed, Etomidate, Fentanyl, Rocuronium   TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. Intubation: 7:35am Incision: 8:28am  Heparin: 8:40am  Cooling: 8:51am  Suppression: 9:43am Cirrc. arrest:  10:01am Cardiac Arrest: 9:02am Warming: 11:04am  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   After intubation a burst suppression pattern is rapidly seen at 1:1 with burst consisting of diffuse disorganized voltage theta and delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies but intermixed diffuse beta. As the patient is cooled the background progressively becomes more attenuated in a symmetric fashion until final diffuse suppression is seen. Some intermitted bitemporal sharply contoured wave forms were seen prior to suppression. As the patient is warmed the background appears to reappear symmetrically and with a diffuse slow burst suppression pattern at the end of the study.   Sleep is not captured  No focal slowing is present.   ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION and CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a uneventful EEG during PTE surgery. Changes were all communicated to primary team.
