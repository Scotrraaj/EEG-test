HISTORY:

35 y.o. male with a history of refractory epilepsy, recent generalized seizures,
none on Keppra;  referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.  Lost to follow up last year
when he was incarcerated.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


IBUPROFEN (MOTRIN PO), Take  by mouth.

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

eslicarbazepine (APTIOM) 400 mg Tablet tablet, Take 4 tablets by mouth daily. 4 Tabs q AM:


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for
Pain. Indications: Pain

Ezlicarbazepine take 4 tablet every morning.  Indications: Epilepsy


Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, (VITAMIN D) 1,000 unit Capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.


TECHNIQUE:





A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG , HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: produces an increase in theta



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:






This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. This EEG is similar to
priors.
