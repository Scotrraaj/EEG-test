DATE OF STUDY: 09/20/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, coma study





HISTORY:

a 51 y.o. female with a history of AML and bilateral subdural hematomas in the
setting of rivaroxaban, with acute L MCA infarct, referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental
status change.




MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA, PROTONIX, ALLOPURINOL, LOPRESSOR, VESANOID



SEDATION: as above


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous and reactive, but disorganized, and asymmetric.

The right hemisphere consists of disorganized theta and alpha activity, with superimposed delta.



The left hemisphere consists of attenuated theta and delta, most prominently over the left temporal
region.


There is no posterior dominant rhythm.



Quieter states consist of further background slowing, most notably over the right hemisphere. There
are no sleep transients.



Moderate generalized slowing is present.

Continuous left hemispheric (temporal predominant) polymorphic slowing and attenuation of faster
frequencies is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

An irregular heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal coma study portable EEG due to:


1. Moderate generalized slowing and background disorganization

2. Continuous left hemispheric (temporal predominant) polymorphic slowing and attenuation of faster
frequencies


3. Irregular heart rate


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of left hemispheric (particularly temporal) cortical dysfunction
(likely structural in etiology) superimposed on a moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
