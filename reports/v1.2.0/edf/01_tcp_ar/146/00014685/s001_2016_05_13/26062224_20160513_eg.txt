DATE OF STUDY: 05/13/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only



HISTORY:

a 41 y.o. male with a history of a recent right ICH requiring craniotomy.



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra, Fentanyl and versed




SEDATION: Fentanyl and versed



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

During arousals the background consists of diffuse polymorphic delta activity with subtle underriding
fast activity.




During periods of quiescence, voltages decrease diffusely and faster activities become more
prominent.


There is continuous slow polymorphic delta activity over the right hemisphere, especially over the
right temporal and central regions.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

An irregular heart rate of >100 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing


2. Severe continuous right hemispheric focal slowing that is especially pronounced over the right
temporal and central regions.

3. Cardiac arrhythmia



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.


Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the right.


An irregular heart rate of >100 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
