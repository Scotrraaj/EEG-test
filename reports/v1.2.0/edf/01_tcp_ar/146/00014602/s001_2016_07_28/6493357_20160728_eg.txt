HISTORY:

73 y.o. female with a history of COPD, alzheimers, and anxiety  referred for
routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Xanax, aricept, gabapentin (on hold)




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by diffusely slow, symmetric, continuous theta. The is no
definitive PDR.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Complex epileptiform discharges were identified. Some were simple right temporal sharp waves.
Others are bilateral but with slow paper speed and average reference they are max at f8 with
involvement of Fz and F7. There is also a bifrontal sharp wave noted.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Triphasic waves



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are questionable electrographic events captured during this study. Although no twitching can
be seen, there is some muscle artifact present with the temporal discharges.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Generalized background slowing

2. Complex epileptiform activity most notable in the right temporal region

3. Simple frontal sharp waves


4. Likely myoclonic jerks not visualized on video.

5. Triphasic waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Generalized background slowing is non specific but can be associated with Alzheimers dementia.
Triphasic waves can be seen in the context of a metabolic encephalopathy. Epileptiform activity can
be correlated with clinical history and imaging and exam.
