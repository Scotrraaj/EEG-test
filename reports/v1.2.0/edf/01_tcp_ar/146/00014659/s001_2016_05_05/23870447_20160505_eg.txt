HISTORY:

81 y.o. female with a history of recurrent TIA like symptoms, r/o ictal aphasia
referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.  She has a headache followed by
stuttering.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

NIFEDICAL XL 60 mg 24 hr tablet,


metFORMIN (GLUCOPHAGE) 500 mg tablet,

hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 50 mg tablet,

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 40 mg tablet,



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.3 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. Isolated temporal theta/delta slowing of
the elderly is seen, as is R occipital headrocking artifact




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78, irreg   is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal  routine EEG for an adult of this age.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
