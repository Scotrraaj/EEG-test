HISTORY:

68 y.o. MALE  S/P  SYNCOPAL EPISODE IN HD

CT B/L CHRONIC SDH  B/L EVACUATION POD 31.  RIGHT CRANI (SKULL


DEFECT RIGHT),  CHART STATES SZ OVERNIGHT. DECREASE IN

RESPONSIVENESS. EYE DEVIATION TO LEFT WITH B/L ARM TWITCHING X 30

MIN.



MEDICATIONS:

Valproic acid and Keppra



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a reactive

9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) seen at best over the

left hemisphere. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of

frequency and amplitude is present over the left hemisphere.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



Continuous low amplitude polymorphic delta activity is present in


the right hemisphere with associated loss of faster frequencies.


Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left

frontal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 138 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. There

were some PVCs present.



IMPRESSION:



1. Continuous focal slowing and attenuation of the right

hemisphere

2. Continuous focal slowing in the left frontal region.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to

continuous focal slowing and attenuation of the right hemisphere

this finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion over that

region and along with the attenuation consistent with the known


subdural. In addition there is  continuous focal slowing in the

left frontal region which is indicative of a structural lesion in


that region. No seizures were seen.
