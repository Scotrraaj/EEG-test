History:	51 year old man with a history of alcohol abuse, now with witnessed mouth 
	foaming, twitching and eyes rolling back.
Medications:	Versed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  For nearly first 60 minutes of the recording, the background 
consists of moderate amplitude diffuse frontally predominant non-rhythmic fast EMG artifact with 
occasional periods of very brief (seconds) quescence that are characterized by diffuse low  
amplitude polymorphic slow delta activity.  By ~ 11:15 am, the degree of EMG artifact lessens and 
by ~11:20 am it is no longer seen.  It reappearance after intense sternal rub.  Vecuronium is 
administered at ~ 11:34 am - this results in resolution of EMG artifact.  The background consists of a
 mixture of polymorphic low amplitue theta and delta activity with theta seen more predominantly 
anteriorly.  With stimulation, faster frequencies appear anteriorly.  No normal sleep architecture is 
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
	No electrographic seizures
	Artifact, EMG, abundant, first ~60 min of the recording.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL nearly 90 minutes continuous video EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse 
slowing. This finding is indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is 
etiologically nonspecific.  EMG artifact is not ictal in etiology and is at least partially stimulus 
induced.  There are subtle signs of the background reactivity.  No electrographic seizures are
