HISTORY:

86 y.o. male with a history of R MCA stroke (7/2016), possible seizures on Keppra,
CAD, and HTN who presents with intermittent left facial twitching and left hemiplegia, referred for
EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events and management of exacerbation.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg


heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

furosemide (LASIX) injection 10 mg

famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg


propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB

aspirin suppository 300 mg




warfarin (COUMADIN) tablet 5 mg

[START ON 11/1/2016] warfarin (COUMADIN) tablet 1 mg


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

ESETT (NCT01960075) infusion




SEDATION: s/p ativan, propofol 40 mcg/kg/min tapered off by 10/31 13:51



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with
T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and
included a single channel of EKG.





DAY 1 (10/31/2016, 08:00 - 11/1/2016, 10:16)



BACKGROUND:


Leads are off between 11/1 03:00-03:20.



The record opens to a waking background that is discontinuous, with abundant 4-7 second periods of
attenuation admixed with disorganized theta, alpha, and beta on the left hemisphere and
disorganized theta and alpha (with attenuated beta) on the right hemisphere, particularly over the
posterior quadrant.




There is no posterior dominant rhythm.



As the day progresses, the background becomes increasingly continuous.

Periods of drowsiness and sleep are characterized by increasing prevalence of delta. Rarely runs of
rudimentary vertex waves are seen in sleep.



Generalized slowing is present, moderate-severe at start of study, becoming mild-moderate as day
progresses.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:




None



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 50s-70s, occasionally irregular


FINAL IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:


1. Generalized slowing (moderate-severe improving to mild-moderate as day progresses) and
suboptimal organization


2. Continuous attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere

3. Occasionally irregular heart rate



FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are indicative of right hemisphere cortical dysfunction, consistent with this patient's
known history of stroke. There is additional evidence for diffuse cerebral dysfunction, improving from
moderate-severe to mild-moderate as study progresses, and which is likely at least in part due to a
medication effect (i.e., propofol).  An occasionally irregular heart rate was noted on a single EKG
lead.
