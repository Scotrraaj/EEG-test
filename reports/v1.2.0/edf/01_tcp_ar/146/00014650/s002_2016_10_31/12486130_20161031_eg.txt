HISTORY:

86 y.o. male presents with left side facial twitching and left arm/leg weakness. Pt
had right MCA stroke in July 2016. CAD and HTN

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity and attenuation of faster frequencies is present in the right
hemisphere maximal in the temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen mainly over the left hemisphere.





Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


1. Continuous focal slow waves and attenuation of faster frequencies is present in the right
hemisphere maximal in the temporal region


2. Moderate diffuse slow waves

3. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere
maximal in the temporal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cortical dysfunction in this
region, likely structural in origin. In addition there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.


Patient will be placed on continuous long term monitoring.
