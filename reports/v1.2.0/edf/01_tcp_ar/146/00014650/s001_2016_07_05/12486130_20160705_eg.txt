HISTORY:

86 y.o. male with a history of R MCA stroke referred for routine EEG for evaluation
of paroxysmal events (left arm tremors).



MEDICATIONS: 2 MG OF ATIVAN GIVEN DURING TEST



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.






During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and further
background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


Mild generalized slowing is present.


Frequent right hemispheric polymorphic slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

Left arm tremor is noted throughout the study by the technician.


CLINICAL: Near the end of the study, the patient's left arm is visible on camera - there is a low
amplitude irregular waxing and waning tremor involving the left wrist.

EEG: There is no EEG change associated with this movement.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Frequent right hemispheric polymorphic slowing

3. Left wrist tremor described above, without EEG correlate



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of right hemispheric dysfunction, structural or
physiologic in origin, superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.





Left wrist tremor had no associated EEG correlate; note that a surface negative simple partial seizure
cannot be entirely excluded.
