DATE OF STUDY: 04/25/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 60 y.o. WOMAN CAME FROM VIRGINIA FOR SECOND OPINION-GOUT IN
FEET THAT WAS AMPUTATED. THIS WEEKEND PT CODED PER NURSE-NO RESPONSE, PT
STATED THAT SHE WAS JUST IN A DEEP SLEEP.




PMHX;GOUT-BOTH FEET AMPUTATED, DM, GALLSTONES REMOVED, BREAST CA-1995.




MEDICATIONS:

CANNABUS PILLS, OXYCODONE, INSULIN




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limted record due
to T5, C3, P3 and P4 as well as movement artifact and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive  Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy limited quality routine EEG.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. Please note this was a
technically difficult study.
