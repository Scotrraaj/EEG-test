HISTORY:

56 y.o. male with a history of chronic

infarcts in the left posterior cerebral artery


Territory, alcohol abuse, transported to the trauma center with

pneumothorax referred for routine EEG for evaluation of

paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

None reported



SEDATION: PROPoFOL, FENTANYL



TECHNIQUE:

The patient seems to be lightly sedated.  When unstimulated, he

is drowsy with a medium amplitude diffuse mixed frequency pattern


which an alpha and theta frequency activity.  With stimulation,




there is eye opening and alerting.  A 10 Hz posterior dominant

rhythm is identified.  Occasionally, it is disrupted in the left


occipital region in comparison to the right slow roving eye

movements and beta activity appears the patient becomes drowsy


with vertex waves noted in stage II sleep

Mild  generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present, aside from the intermittently

disrupted off on the left.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile stimulation awakens the patient


briefly

EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 83 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Reg


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy/asleep bedside portable ICU EEG due


to:

1. intermittent disruption of the alpha rhythm on the left


2. generous beta.

3. mild slowing in maximal wakefulness


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


The overall picture is one of a sedated study, congruent with the

use of medications described above.  The intermittent disruption


of the alpha rhythm on the left may be a hallmark of the

patient's previous stroke.  No epileptiform features were seen.
