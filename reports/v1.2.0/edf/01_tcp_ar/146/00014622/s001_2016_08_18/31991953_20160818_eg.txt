SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of alpha rhythm and normal low
microvoltage frontocentral beta and rhythmic theta. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and
reactive 10.7 Hertz 35-40mV posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with
eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Stage II sleep is identified but not sustained and is characterized by normal sleep transients, with
synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes, and abundant POSTS.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

There is occasional head rocking artifact and normal variant wicket rhythms identified



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
