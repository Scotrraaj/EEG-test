HISTORY:

 a 55 y.o. male TRANSFERRED FOR EVALUATION OF AMS

AND LIVER TRANSPLANT



MEDICATIONS:

NYSTATIN, LACTULOSE, FOLATE, PROTONIX, THIAMINE, NADOLOL,


RIFAXIMIN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening. The waking background is symmetric, reactive,


and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of

bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient.  However there is excessive

almost continuous theta seen diffusely in wakefulness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Excessive theta in

wakefulness.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1. Excessive theta in wakefulness.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due excess theta

in wakefulness. This findings are indicative of mild diffuse


cerebral dysfunction which is non-specific with regards to

etiology.
