History:	55 year old man with persistent change in mental status.
Medications:	Off fentanyl for ~24 hours.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of attenuated theta and 
delta activity admixed with frequent periods of discontinuity.  No normal sleep architecture is 
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no clear change in the 
background activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  A single EKG lead demonstrates 
an irregular heart rate.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
	Discontinuous background, frequent
	No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute comatose portable EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse 
slowing and frequent periods of background discontinuity. These findings are indicative of 
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  When compared to the 
EEG from 1/27/2016, diffuse background slowing is more severe.
