HISTORY:

33 y.o. male with a history of mental

retardation, pervasive developmental disorder with psychotic


features, hyperopia, astigmatism, eosinophila, dysphagia, and

dystonia referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical

seizures.



MEDICATIONS: trihexyphen, seroquel, klonopin



SEDATION: None listed


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


difficult record; the tech noted that patient was combative




during the hook-up.  The study included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a


fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha and excess beta

frequencies, with fragments of a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior

gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal, somewhat technically limited, awake only


routine EEG due to:

1. Suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse

cerebral dysfunction.


Excess beta may be seen in the setting of certain medications

(i.e., benzodiazepines, barbiturates).
