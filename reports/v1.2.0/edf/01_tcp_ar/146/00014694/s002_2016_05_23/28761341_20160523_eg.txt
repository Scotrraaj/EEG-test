HISTORY:

50 y.o. FEMALE WITH CC STROKE L SIDE JULY 2015.  PROPHYLAXIS
KEPPRA STOPPED FOLLOW UP 1 HOUR EEG.



MEDICATIONS:

NEURONTIN, OXYCODONE, COUMADIN, PLAQUENIL



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.






During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the F7 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
focal slowing in the F7 region



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Continuous focal slow waves in the left frontotemporal region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the left
frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region,
likely structural in origin and consistent with the history of a stroke.
