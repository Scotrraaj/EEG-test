HISTORY:

50 y.o. female with a history of stroke

referred for routine EEG for a possible discontinuation of an


AED.


MEDICATIONS:

daily.

warfarin (COUMADIN) 5 mg tablet, Take 9 mg by mouth. As directed

hydroxychloroquine (PLAQUENIL) 200 mg tablet, Take  by mouth 2

times daily. Indications: Rheumatoid Arthritis



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.



Diffuse excess beta activity is present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.



Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is seen over the


left temporal region.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional

abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of <60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


Focal slowing - nearly continuous - moderate - left temporal

No sleep

No epileptiform discharges

Beta - excess



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal 21-minute awake and drowsy EEG due to nearly

continuous moderate focal left temporal slowing.


This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this

region.


No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not

recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep


recording may provide additional information.

Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication

effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
