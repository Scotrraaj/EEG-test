HISTORY:

58 y.o. male with a history of COPD, HBP, CAD, seizure in 1980s while using
cocaine, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of recent loss of consciousness.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs
every 6 hours as needed for Wheezing.


buPROPion (WELLBUTRIN SR) 150 mg 12 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.


budesonide-formoterol (SYMBICORT) 160-4.5 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs 2
times daily for 360 days.

fluticasone-salmeterol (ADVAIR) 250-50 mcg/dose diskus inhaler, Inhale 1 puff into the lungs every
12 hours.


amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily.


simvastatin (ZOCOR) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth nightly.




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel one hour electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by a large amount of generalized beta activity along with
occasional symmetric and reactive 20-25 uV 11-13 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). Alpha
activity attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Moderate amounts of muscle artifact were also
noted.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, and
sleep spindles. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:




There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal one hour awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic
events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
