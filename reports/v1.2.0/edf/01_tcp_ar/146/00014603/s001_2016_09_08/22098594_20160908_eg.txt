DATE OF STUDY: 09/08/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 63 y.o. female with a history of recurrent LOC  referred for routine EEG for
evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

SAXAGLIPTIN HCL (ONGLYZA PO), Take  by mouth.

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.


meloxicam (MOBIC) 15 mg tablet, Take 15 mg by mouth daily.

simvastatin (ZOCOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth nightly.

acetaminophen-codeine (TYLENOL #3) 300-30 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.
Indications: Knee pain Rx by PCP


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces scant
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an
important consideration, please obtain 1 hour EEG
