HISTORY:

a 80 y.o. female with a history of left BKA,

right AKA, afib, HTN, CVA, and pulmonary hypertension presenting


with elft sided weakness and slurred speech referred for routine

EEG for possible seizure.



MEDICATIONS: ATORVASTATIN, PROTONIX, LISINOPRIL, METOPROLOL


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous and symmetric but consists of


mostly disorganized delta activity with suppressed faster

frequencies.  Occasionally variability is present, and theta


frequencies appear admixed in with the delta activity. There is

no clear reactivity, but spontaneous eyeblink artifact is present

and the patient is noted by the tech to squeeze with her right

hand (but not with her left hand).  There is no posterior


dominant rhythm.



Sleep transients are not captured.


Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

An irregular heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG

lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and disorganization of

background


2. An irregular heart rate of 96 bpm captured on a single EKG

lead



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of moderate to severe

diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

An irregular heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG

lead
