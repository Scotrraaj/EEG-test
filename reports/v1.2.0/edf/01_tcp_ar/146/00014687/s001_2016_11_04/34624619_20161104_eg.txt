HISTORY:

38 y.o. female with a history of emergency C- section and decreased responsiveness
referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.

SEDATION: Versed, Fentanyl



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The patient was intubated and somewhat restless during the study. Background demonstrated
generalized poorly organized irregular low to medium voltage 2-8 Hz activity with superimposed
muscle and EKG artifact. Moderate amounts of low voltage rhythmic 10-15 Hz activity was seen over
central and temporal regions. Background was non-reactive to auditory stimulation.




No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 95 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:


1. Diffuse background disorganization and slowing

2. Poor reactivity to auditory stimulation



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific and indicate bi-hemispheric cortical dysfunction such as that seen
with diffuse encephalopathies of various possible etiologies. No clinical or electrographic seizure
activity and no paroxysmal epileptiform discharges were recorded.
