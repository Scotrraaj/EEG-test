HISTORY:

65 YO FEMALE WITH A HX OF NEW ONSET SZ.

ONE IN OCT 2015 AND NOV 2015. + LOC, +TOUNGE BITE, - INCONT. ?


GENERALIZED SHAKING. AFTERWARDS THE PT FELT DISORIENTED AND

TIRED.

NO AURA.


NO HX OF SZ OR STROKE

PMH: MELANOMA, PULMONARY FIBROSIS



MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA, LIPITOR, TYLENOL, HYDRODIURIL, OFEV, ZOLOFT, COREG



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the




International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG, and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy 1 hour EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy 1 hour EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
