DATE OF STUDY: 05/02/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only





HISTORY:

a 57 y.o. female with a history of change in mental status referred for routine
EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is very disorganized and consists of nearly continuous diffuse theta and delta
slowing. There is excessive muscle artifact that at times obscures the cerebral activity. The delta
activity intermittently assumes a triphasic morphology. There are no clinical or electrographic
seizures seen.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 80-90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to:


1. Diffuse bihemispheric slowing

2. Triphasic waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings of diffuse slowing and triphasic waves indicate a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy or
diffuse structural brain injury. There were no clinical or electrgraphic seizures recorded.
