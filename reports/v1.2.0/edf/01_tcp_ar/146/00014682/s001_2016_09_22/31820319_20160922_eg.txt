DATE OF STUDY: 09/22/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 66 y.o. female with a history of confusion and 20-30 sec shaking spells referred for
routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.


Of note: hx of ESRD on HD M/W/F, HTN, DM2, HCV, Parkinson's presenting with fever and altered
mental status at dialysis. CSF with low glucose and elevated WBC.


MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:

TECHNIQUE:

A  Bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is reasonably symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of theta  and a
moderate amount of bifrontal delta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Frontal activity is often in the faster theta range



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, Vertex waves and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved

Moderate generalized slowing is present.  No significant focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  FIRDA

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile and verbal stimulation produce an alerting.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is abnormal routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.

1. Generalized background slowing


2. Occasional FIRDA

CLINICAL CORRELATION:





This routine EEG supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function, which may include toxic-metabolic
encephalopathy or infectious process. There are no specific hallmarks of a CNS infections process.
There are no epileptiform features.
