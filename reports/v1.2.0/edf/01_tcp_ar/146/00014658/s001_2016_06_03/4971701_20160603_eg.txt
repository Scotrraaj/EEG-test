HISTORY:

61 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O EPILEPSY. NOTED WITH LT  SKULL
DEFECT RECENT TRAMATIC SDH/SAH. PT WAS SEEN HAVING A SZ. IN MAGEE REHABILITION
HOSPITAL. STARING TO THE LEFT, DECREASED RESPONSIVENESS, INCREASED
DYSARTHRIA. PMHX EOTH ABUSE, HTN, HEP C.



MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and theta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
There is  anterior-to-posterior gradient at times.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region with associated
loss of faster frequencies.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Continuous left anterior temporal focal slow and loss of faster frequencies

2. Intermittent right anterior temporal focal slow



3. Mild diffuse slow and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.
This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin.


In addition there is intermittent focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region and mild diffuse
slow and disorganization.  These findings are indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction and mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction respectively, which are etiologically non-specific.




No seizures were seen.
