HISTORY:

57 YO FEMALE P/W SYNCOPAL EVENT FOUND TO

HAVE BRAIN TUMOR, RESECTD 3/4/16 WITH BLEEDING POST OP WHICH


REQUIRED EMBOLIZATION AND CRANIOTOMY, NECK EXPLORATION AND

LIGATION OF RIGHT ICA AND RIGHT VA, DEVELOPED NONTRAUMATIC RIGHT

PTX S/P CHEST TUBE.



MEDICATIONS:

FOSPHENYTOIN AND ATIVAN



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically




satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity

with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies.



Sleep is not captured



There is continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the

right frontal region during wakefulness, increasing during

drowsiness.

This has an associated increased amplitude consistent with a


breach.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Continuous focal slowing in the right frontal region


2. Diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal coma only routine EEG due to continuous focal

slowing in the right frontal region.  This finding is indicative


of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely

structural in origin. In addition there is moderate to severe

diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These

findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate


diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
