SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to myogenic artifact over the left and included a single channel of EKG and a single EMG channel
over the left lips and chin.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a disorganized mainly theta and delta
frequencies seen best on the left. There is at times a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches
7Hz.




Sleep is not captured.







Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal at the F4 region
with loss faster frequencies and an asymmetric increased amplitude consistent with a breach.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right temproal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness , which at times were very sharply contoured.



Moderate generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent sharp waves are seen at F4/C4.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Sharpy contoured activity seen on the left.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

The patient exhibited left facial twitching and an EMG was applied. The myogenic artifact seen
frequently and caused by the facial twitching had no clear EEG correlate.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



1. Frequent sharp waves in the right fronto-central region with no clear clinical correlate.

2. Myogenic artifact on the left face with no EEG correlate.


3. Continuous focal slow waves in the right hemisphere maximal at right frontal region with loss faster
frequencies and an asymmetric increased amplitude consistent with a breach.

4. Intermittent focal slow waves in the right temporal region, which at times were very sharply
contoured.


5. Moderate diffuse slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:











This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to frequent sharp waves in the right fronto-
central region with no clear clinical correlate along with continuous focal slow waves and breach.
These findings are consistent with focal cortical dysfunction and irritability in the area of the known
prior injury. In addition, the facial twitching captured had no clear EEG correlate, however only 25%
of simple partial seizures may be seen on EEG. Lastly there is intermittent focal slowing in the left
temporal region and moderate diffuse slow waves.  These findings are indicative of focal and diffuse
cerebral dysfunction respectively and are etiologically non-specific.
