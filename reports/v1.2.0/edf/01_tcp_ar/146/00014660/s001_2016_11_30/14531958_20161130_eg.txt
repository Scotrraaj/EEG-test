SEDATION: propofol



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.


The background over the right consists of up to 9 Hz low amplitude polymorphic alpha activity
posteriorly, excess polymorphic theta activity and poor AP gradient.


The background over the left consists of up to 7  Hz theta activity posteriorly, diffuse theta and
underriding delta activity.



No normal sleep architecture is present but periods of quiescence are captured.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):



None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal portable EEG due to:


1. Mild diffuse slowing

2. Continuous moderate left hemispheric focal slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.

Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the left.



The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
