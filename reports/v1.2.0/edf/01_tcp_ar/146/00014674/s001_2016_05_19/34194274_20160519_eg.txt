DATE OF STUDY: 05/19/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 51 y.o. male with a history of new onset seizure with CT showing bilateral
temporal edema; referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Dilantin SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and  verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. Intermittent
excess theta is seen in wakefulness. There is prominent frontal beta.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.





Sleep is not captured



Intermittent, mild  generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Occasional wicket waves are noted during drowsiness over the temporal regions


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile stimulation produces an arousal

EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Intermittent excess theta in a somewhat uncooperative patient.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are non specific and can be seen in post ictal state, toxic or metabolic
encephalopathy or other cause. No epileptiform or periodic features were seen.
