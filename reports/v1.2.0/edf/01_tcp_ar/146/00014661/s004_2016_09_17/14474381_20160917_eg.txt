HISTORY: 30 y.o. male with a history of 2 gunshot wounds to the head, s/p b/l frontal craniotomies, now with 2 possible seizures, s/p 2 mg Ativan, referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events and screening for subclinical seizures.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: sodium chloride 3 % infusion 500 mL metroNIDAZOLE (FLAGYL) IVPB 500 mg enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 30 mg levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB HYDROmorphone (DILAUDID) injection 0.5 mg potassium chloride IVPB 20 mEq 100 mL chlorhexidine (PERIDEX) 0.12 % solution 15 mL albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 5 mg acetylcysteine (MUCOMYST) 20 % 1 mL plus albuterol 2.5 mg/3 mL nebulizer mixture solution ceFEPIme (MAXIPIME) 2 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+ phenylephrine (NEO-SYNEPHRINE) 80 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL infusion dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg gentamicin PF 8 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg fentaNYL (SUBLIMAZE) 1 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion   SEDATION: propofol drip 80 mcg/kg/min, ativan 2 mg, fentanyl drip 175 mcg/hr  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (9/16/2016, 20:13 - 9/17/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The background is featureless and consists of diffuse attenuated disorganized delta. Higher amplitudes over the bilateral frontal regions, with superimposed beta, is noted, likely consistent with breach rhythm. There are occasional bursts of 50-70 uV alpha and theta over the bifrontal regions, lasting for < 1 second.  There is no reactivity, variability, or state change.  There is severe generalized slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 70s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing, with disorganized background, and lack of reactivity 2. Bilateral frontal breach rhythms  These findings indicate the presence of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, at least in part due to medication effect. The bilateral frontocentral breach rhythms are consistent with this patient's known history of bilateral craniotomies.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (9/17/2016, 06:00 - 9/18/2016, 06:00)  Propofol downtitrated to 60 mcg/kg/min 11:00, then increased back to 80 mcg/kg/min 16:00. Fentanyl increased to 200 mcg/hr.  BACKGROUND: Diffuse attenuated delta with higher amplitudes over the bilateral frontal regions, similar to day 1. No bursts of theta/alpha on this day.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s-90s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Severe generalized slowing (at least in part due to medication effect) with bilateral frontal breach rhythms as on day 1.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (9/18/2016, 06:00 - 9/18/2016, 12:24)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 90s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change  -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Severe generalized slowing, with disorganized background, and lack of reactivity 2. Bilateral frontal breach rhythms   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, at least in part due to medication effect. The bilateral frontocentral breach rhythms are consistent with this patient's known history of bilateral craniotomies.
