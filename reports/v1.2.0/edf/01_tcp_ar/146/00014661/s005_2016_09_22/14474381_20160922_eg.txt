HISTORY:

30 y.o. male with a history of Clinical seizure yesterday afternoon characterized by
left gaze deviation and tonic clonic rhythmic shaking in bilateral upper and lower extremities that
responded to midazolam bolus. Patient was on 2 of midazolam drip for sedation. At that time keppra
increased to 1500grams q12 from 1 gram q12. referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental
status change.

TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation. The patient is intubated with prior
bifrontal craniotomy for multi-compartmental syndrome




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is characterized by diffusely slow pattern, primarily with a mixture of delta and theta.
Verbal and tactile stimulation were performed on multiple occasions.  This seems to produce an
increase in faster beta frequency activity from the left more so than the right. There is also scant
alpha frequency activity.



Severe generalized slowing is present.

Because of the craniotomy, there is a clear asymmetry with eye movements and other extracranial
patterns.  However, there is also a little bit more sharply contoured slowing on the right




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: See above. This EEG is reactive and variable.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal ICU routine EEG due to:


1. Marked bilateral slowing with minor shifting asymmetries




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings for a severe bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function, congruent with the history
outlined above.  No epileptiform features were noted. The presence of reactivity and variability are
positive prognostic features.
