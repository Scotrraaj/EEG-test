DATE OF STUDY: 01/09/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only




HISTORY:

a 65 y.o. female who presents with syncope and altered mental status referred for
routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

ciprofloxacin HCl (CIPRO) tablet 500 mg

amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg


aspirin EC tablet 81 mg

carvedilol (COREG) tablet 25 mg

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 80 mg


ferrous sulfate tablet 325 mg

calcitRIOL (ROCALTROL) capsule 0.25 mcg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg



heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

cloNIDine (CATAPRES) tablet 0.3 mg



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured


No generalized slowing is present.


Frequent right hemispheric polymorphic slowing, often with spread to the left hemisphere, is
captured.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Frequent right hemispheric polymorphic slowing, often with spread to the left hemisphere




CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of right hemisphere cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.
