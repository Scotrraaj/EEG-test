SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a disorganized mixture of theta more
than delta frequencies, with a poorly defined posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at best reaches
7.5Hertz . The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is lost.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is captured but normal architecture is not seen.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the posterior
parietal region there is an associated loss of faster frequencies.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Very frequent wicket waves are noted during drowsiness over the temporal regions, some with a
suspicious morphology.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere maximal in the posterior parietal region with
associated loss of faster frequencies.


2. Continuous focal slowing in the right frontal region.

3. Please note that frequent sharply contoured wickets are seen some with a suspicious morphology
but not definitive epileptogenic.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the left
hemisphere maximal in the posterior parietal region with associated loss of faster frequencies and
continuous focal slowing in the right frontal region.  These findings is indicative of severe focal
cerebral dysfunction in these regions, likely structural in origin.
