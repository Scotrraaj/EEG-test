DATE OF STUDY: 08/10/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 34 y.o. female with a history of Episodic left-sided numbness and weakness and
bilateral upper extremity muscle twitching, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal
events.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet

docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

Or

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) suppository 650 mg


famotidine (PEPCID) tablet 20 mg

heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units








SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9-11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. A large amount of muscle artifact was
noted.


During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.
