DATE OF STUDY: 06/23/16 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only  HISTORY: Male Unk Blk is a 41 y.o. male with a history of  found unresponsive in the field, questionable seizure referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.  MEDICATIONS:   SEDATION: Propofol was just discontinued prior to the study  TECHNIQUE: A ICU, portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and  Verbal  Stimulation.  The patient was intubated and unresponsive  EEG BACKGROUND: The background is characterized by the presence of a symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with diffuse 13 and 19 Hz activity and smaller amounts of 11 Hz activity.  However, with tactile stimulation, the patient awakens, does not open his eyes but follows commands.  EEG is a diffuse beta pattern at that time No generalized slowing is present.   No focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: see above   EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 98 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep routine EEG due to: 1. Marked excess beta  CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are frequently found in association with the use of sedative hypnotic medications, benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  No epileptiform features were seen.  The vigorous reactivity to external stimuli is a positive prognostic feature   Attending Epileptologist:  I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
