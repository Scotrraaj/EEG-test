meningioma



Summary of Diagnostic Data

MRI brain +/-c 4/29/2016: Right sphenoid wing meningioma (1.7 x 0.8 cm). Comparison to prior
studies, which were not performed here, is needed to assess for growth. May represent increase in size
based on below reports.





U Penn Health Systems:

MRI brain 10/2013: 8x12 mm R sphenoid wing meningioma - stable on subsequent imaging




MRI/MRA head and neck (5/2014): No acute intracranial abnormality. Scattered foci of increased T2
signal in the white matter. Patent intracranial and cervical arterial vasculature. Stable right sphenoid
wing meningioma


Patent intracranial + cervical vasculature




MRI C-spine (10/2014): Normal cervical spine MRI. No canal stenosis or significant neural foraminal
narrowing.




TTE 10/2014: EF 60%




aEEG 4/14-16/2016: 48 hour ambulatory EEG. There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected




U Penn Health Systems:

EMU admit: 2 episodes of forced eye closure, head shaking, no electrographic correlate - diagnosed
with psychogenic nonepileptic events


EEG routine 2/28/14: normal



Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events with apnea atypical for
PNES.

Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:


- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.





- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.




MEDICATIONS:


Lamictal 100mg qhs- stopped on day 1

Topiramate 100mg q12hr

DAY 1 (6/27/2016, 13:53 - 6/28/2016, 08:00)



BACKGROUND:

EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



 Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:


Interictal Findings:

None



Ictal Findings:

The patient had no clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the
epilepsy monitoring unit.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Unclear



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:




1. Possible PNES but no events with apnea were captured.



CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 6 days with continuous video
EEG.  This was an uneventful EMU monitoring session.



The patient was weaned off Lamictal and Topamax over the course of her admission. She was
restarted on her medication on the day prior to her discharge from the hospital. No other medication
changes were made during the hospitalization.
