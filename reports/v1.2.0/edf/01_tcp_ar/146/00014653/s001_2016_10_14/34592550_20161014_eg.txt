SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUEA Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:






The patient is intubated and unresponsive. Background reveals generalized low voltage slowing, with
predominant amplitudes in the 5-15 uV range and frequencies of 2-5 Hz. During much of the record,
pseudoperiodic bursts of higher amplitude delta and low voltage beta frequencies are seen every
1.5-2.5 seconds, with bursts lasting 1/2 to 1 second. No change in background was seen in response
to auditory stimulation. Prominent EKG artifact was seen.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 115 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal bedside EEG due to:

1. Marked generalized amplitude attenuation and slowing


2. Pseudo-periodic bursts of mixed low voltage beta and higher amplitude delta frequency activity

3. Poor reactivity to auditory stimulation.



No clinical or electrographic seizures were recorded.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate a marked bi-hemispheric functional disturbance which can be seen in
association with severe generalized encephalopathies of various etiologies.
