This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG   DAY 1 (10/17/2016 - 10/18/2016, 9:00AM)  BACKGROUND: There is no PDR or AP gradient.  With stimulation/ during periods of arousals, the background consists of a mixture of low to moderate amplitude scant theta activity and prominent semi-rhythmic and rhythmic slow delta activity occurring at ~1 Hz. There is no temporal or spatial evolution of this activity. During periods of quiescence, the amount of theta activity increases and periodicity of delta activity seen during arousals lessens.  Periods of discontinuity too are seen during periods of quiescence.  No normal sleep architecture is present.    PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured ~90 bpm.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal ~15 hour long term video EEG due to: Moderate to severe diffuse slowing.  This finding is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  When compared to a spot EEG from 10/14/2016, the degree of slowing is less.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (10/18/16, 09:00 - 10/19/2016, 08:00)  BACKGROUND: No significant change.  Overall periods of arousals are longer and more frequent.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured 102 bpm   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION This is an abnormal ~23 hour long term video EEG due to: Moderate to severe diffuse slowing.  This finding is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.      -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 2 day video EEG due to:  1. Moderate to severe diffuse slowing   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This finding is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Even through rhythmic and semi-rhythmic activity is present it does not evolve in electrographic seizures.
