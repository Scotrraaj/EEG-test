SEDATION: None

Vecuronium was given.



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to muscle artifact until vecuronium was given and included a single channel of EKG and photic
stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:



With vecuronium clear continuous frontal predominant periodic discharges at 1-2 Hz can be seen.
This discharges are mainly generalized but at times appear asymmetric and with a clear spike and
wave morphology at other times a more triphasic morphology. This are overall most consistent with
generalized periodic discharges with intermittent spike activity  (GPD's +S)




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. GPD's


2. Severe generalized slow waves.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and GPDs +.
These findings are indicative of severe diffuse cortical dysfunction and irritability. The pattern is non
specific but can be seen mainly in anoxic injury.


This patient will go on to long term monitoring.
