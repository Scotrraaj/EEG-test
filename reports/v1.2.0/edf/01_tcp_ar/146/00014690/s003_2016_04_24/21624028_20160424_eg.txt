HISTORY: 54 y.o. male referred for EEG as part of hypothermia protocol.  Patient found down in cardiac arrest, down time 45 min, now s/p RCA stent.  Patient had already begun hypothermia protocol when EEG monitoring was started.  MEDICATIONS, SEDATION: Propofol, integrilin. Tech notes sedation is off at 14:03.  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was at times a technically challenging record due to diffuse muscle artifact.  The study included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (4/24/2016, 14:03 - 4/25/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The record opens to diffuse muscle artifact. As the day progresses, this artifact becomes less apparent, revealing a background that is suppressed without reactivity, variability, or state change.  Severe generalized slowing is present. There is no focal slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS:  At the start of the study, there are frequent bursts of sharply contoured diffuse theta and delta activity lasting <1 sec each. Video review for selected episodes reveals shivering and/or coughing/vent-bucking movements. As the study progresses these bursts become periodic at times, occurring every 2 seconds for runs <30 sec. There is no clear correlate on video. Note that this activity is not clearly cerebral in origin and may represent artifact.  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 100s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing without reactivity, variability, or state change.  These findings are consistent with severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which can at least in part be attributed to a medication effect as well as hypothermia. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (4/25/2016, 06:00 - 4/26/2016, 06:00)  Temperature of 33.4 noted 4/25/2016 at 14:23.  BACKGROUND: Remains suppressed. By evening on this day there is re-emergence of diffuse muscle artifact that makes interpretation of background suboptimal. This artifact acutely resolves on 4/26/2016 05:45, revealing again a suppressed background.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: severe  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): as on day 1, there are frequent bursts of activity, now low-amplitude bluntly-contoured delta, lasting <1 second. There is no clear correlate on video.  This activity is not clearly cerebral in origin and may represent artifact.  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS:  4/26/2016 at 04:30  CLINICAL: team reports patient biting down on tube at this time EEG: there is no change in the background during this time  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 90s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change. Severe generalized slowing. An episode of biting down reported by team to occur 4/26/2016 at 04:30 had no EEG correlate.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (4/26/2016, 06:00 - 4/26/2016, 14:08)  Temperature of 36.6 noted on 4/26/2016 at 08:23  BACKGROUND: No change. Suppressed.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 100s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change. Severe generalized slowing. -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Severe generalized slowing without reactivity, variability, or state change 2. An episode of biting noted by the team 4/26/2016 at 04:30 that had no EEG correlate.  FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may at least in part be affected by sedating medications and hypothermia. An episode of biting down reported by team to occur 4/26/2016 at 04:30 had no EEG correlate.
