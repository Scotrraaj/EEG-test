DATE OF STUDY: 09/03/16 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only   CPT: 95819
 HISTORY: a 59 y.o. female with a history of memory loss spells, anxiety referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.  MEDICATIONS: Current Outpatient Prescriptions: lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 100 mg tablet,  venlafaxine (EFFEXOR-XR) 75 mg 24 hr capsule, TAKE ONE CAPSULE BY MOUTH TWICE A DAY metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 50 mg 24 hr tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH DAILY. escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily. omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 20 mg by mouth daily. metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 50 mg 24 hr tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH DAILY. simvastatin (ZOCOR) 20 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH NIGHTLY. azelastine (ASTEPRO) 0.15 % (205.5 mcg) Spray, Non-Aerosol, Inhale 205.5 mcg into the nose 2 times daily. clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth daily.   TECHNIQUE: A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz 45 uV posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  Sleep is not captured No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present. OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  wicket ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:       Hyperventilation: increases amplitude       Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study. HEART RATE: A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. IMPRESSION: This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG. A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. conclusions.
