HISTORY:

84 y.o. female with a history of CABG on 5/24/2016, was observed to have an episode
of stiffening.



MEDICATIONS:


Ativan

Precedex



SEDATION: Ativan

Precedex



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.



With stimulation, the background consists of a mixture moderate amplitude polymorphic theta and
delta activity with underriding fast activity.



For the majority of the recording, the background consists of low-to-moderate amplitude diffuse sleep-
spindle like waveforms, slow underriding delta activity and brief periods of the background
discontinuity.




No normal sleep architecture is seen.


Intermittent subtle paucity of faster frequencies is noted over the right temporal region.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.






EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

An irregular heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate diffuse slowing


2. Cardiac arrhythmia


CLINICAL CORRELATION:





Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific, but in this case at least partially related to the medication effect.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.



An irregular heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
