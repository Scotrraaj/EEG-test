HISTORY:

26 y.o. WOMAN PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ ONSET AT AGE 3, SZ ARE DURING
SLEEP. PMHX SIG FOR LGS



MEDICATIONS:


No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-
posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Excess theta seen in wakefulness.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Almost continuous frontal predominant generalized epileptiform discharges are seen at a frequency
of 3.5 to 4 Hz.


No clinical correlate is seen with the discharges.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Generalized frontal predominant fast spike and wave

2. Mild generalized slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to generalized frontal predominant fast spike
and wave which can be seen in a generalized epilepsy. In addition there is mild diffuse background
slowing.  This finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.






No seizures were seen.
