DATE OF STUDY: 09/12/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 60 min +, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 58 y.o. male with a history of liver disease and seizures referred for routine
1hour  EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 150 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily. Take as directed

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 600 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 4 times daily (before meals and
nightly) for 360 days.


NALTREXONE MICROSPHERES (VIVITROL IM), Inject  into the muscle every 30 days.


METOPROLOL SUCCINATE (TOPROL XL PO), Take 50 mg by mouth daily.

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, 2 times daily.

nortriptyline (PAMELOR) 25 mg capsule, Take  by mouth nightly.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.






SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5-9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. Lambda is
seen. Likely Mu was noted, but no testing was done to confirm this.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with abundant POSTS synchronous and symmetric
vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent  slowing is present, characterized by a slow alpha of 7.8-8.3 Hz.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Photic Stimulation: scant driving present



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Intermittent, mild background slowing in a very somnolent patient.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are non specific and could be related to medicines or liver disease. There were no
sharp waves.
