HISTORY:

50 y.o. female with a history of recent craniotomy for meningioma, re-admitted
for episode slurred speech and R arm numbness referred for routine EEG for evaluation of
paroxysmal events.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation. Patient has left scalp staples.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and  Generous beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There
is a small amount of disorganization, and some theta




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by brief vertex waves



Mild generalized slowing is present.

In addition to a breach rhythm, intermittent left mid temporal focal slowing is present; characterized
by theta, with an burst or two of delta.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Sharply contoured activity in context of breach, rare, left drowsy only.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: verbal stimuli produces an arousal.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild background slowing

2. Superimposed left focal slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings in a relatively acute post operative patient are not
uncommon.  The focal slowing is in the region of the craniotomy. There are no epileptiform features.
