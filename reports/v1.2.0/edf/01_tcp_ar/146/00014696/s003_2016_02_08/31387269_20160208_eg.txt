HISTORY:

52 y.o. FEMALE, EEG TO ASSESS BRAIN FUNCTION

PRIOR TO TRA. PT WAS ON A HIGHER DOES OF SEDATION, NOW ON 2 OF


VERSED. DR WANT TO PUT PT BACK ON TO THE TRANSPLANT LIST.


ILD / PULMONARY FIBROSIS, CHRONIC HYPOXIC RESP. FAILURE, GERD,


GASTROPARESIS


FOLLOW UP



MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs



SEDATION: VERSED



TECHNIQUE:




A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due to

muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage

theta activity and at times a PDR was seen, which at best reached


7 Hz,



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Mild to moderate diffuse slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal routine limited EEG due to mild to moderate


diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These

findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to


moderate moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
