HISTORY:

64 y.o. man WITH ACUTE RIGHT MCA CVA, PT WITH

INTERMITTANT CHANGE MS AND EYE DEVIATION TO RIGHT.



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra


Protonix


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

A posterior dominant rhythm was present only on the left


hemisphere and at best reaches 9Hz. Background activity was

characterized by excess diffuse theta activity in wakefulness


with and some anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies only

seen over the left hemisphere.


The right hemisphere reveals continuous very low amplitude


(attenuated) focal polymorphic delta maximal at F8/T4 (at times

sharply contoured).



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is also present in the

F7/T3 region during wakefulness.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:


1. Right hemisphere attenuation and continuous focal slowing

maximal in the anterior temporal region


2. Intermittent left anterior temporal focal slowing

3. Mild diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION


This is an Abnormal EEG due to continuous right hemisphere

attenuation and focal slow. This finding is consistent with the

known large stroke in that region. There is additional focal

slowing in the left anterior temporal region and mild diffuse


slowing.  This findings are indicative of focal and diffuse

cerebral dysfunction respectively, which are non-specific with


regards to etiology. No seizures were seen.
