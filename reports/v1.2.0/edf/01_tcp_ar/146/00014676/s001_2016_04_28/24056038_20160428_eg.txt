HISTORY:

82 y.o. female with a history of  R sided weakness referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet,

levothyroxine (SYNTHROID, LEVOTHROID) 75 mcg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray,


traMADol (ULTRAM) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for Pain.

losartan (COZAAR) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth daily.

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


pravastatin (PRAVACHOL) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth daily.

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.



SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:

Bedside  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.3 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  Occasional age appropriate isolated
temporal slowing is seen.



Sleep is  Not sustained.



No generalized slowing is present.  No signficant focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm, irregular is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG for an adult of this age .  There are no clinical or
electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
