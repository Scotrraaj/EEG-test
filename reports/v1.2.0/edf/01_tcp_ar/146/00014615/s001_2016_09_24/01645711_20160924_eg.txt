HISTORY:

56 y.o. MALE R HANDED. PT ADMITTED FOR UNWITNESSED SZ.



MEDICATIONS:

DEPAKOTE, HALDOL, HEPARIN, DILANTIN



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and with stimulation theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.





Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.





Sleep is not captured


Moderate generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate generalized slow waves

2. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to moderate diffuse background slowing and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.




No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
