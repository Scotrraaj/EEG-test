START DATE OF STUDY: 09/21/16 at 16:09 END DATE OF STUDY: 09/22/16   RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 44 y.o. OLD MALE P/W SEPSIS ACUTE RESP. FAILURE AND AKI,ON CKD ALTERED MENTAL STATUS.  PMHX REMOTE RENAL TRANSPLANT  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: [START ON 9/24/2016] amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 1.5 mg tacrolimus (PROGRAF) suspension 2 mg heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units predniSONE (DELTASONE) tablet 5 mg carvedilol (COREG) tablet 25 mg acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) packet 17 g famotidine (PEPCID) 40 mg/5 mL (8 mg/mL) suspension 20 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.   DAY 1 (09/21/2016, 16:09 - 9/22/2016, 13:00)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta (at times semi-rhythmic) and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  At times diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  Normal sleep was not captured but some spindles and state changes are noted.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured 84  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
