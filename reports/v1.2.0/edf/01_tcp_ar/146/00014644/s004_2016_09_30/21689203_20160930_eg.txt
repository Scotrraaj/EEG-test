SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.


Intermixed burst of diffuse beta activity are seen for 1-3 seconds.



Sleep is not captured



Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None






ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no change in the background activity to visual, auditory,
tactile, or noxious stimuli.







EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



1.  Moderate to severe diffuse background slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to moderate to severe diffuse background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to
severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
