DATE OF STUDY: 09/20/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep





HISTORY:

a 44 y.o. male with a history of sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute on chronic kidney
disease s/p renal transplant in remote past, referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status
change.




MEDICATIONS:
PROGRAF,CELLCEPT,COUMADIN,FLEXERIL,LIPITOR,PROCARDIA,TYLENOL,AZACTAM


SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous and symmetric but consists of poorly organized predominantly delta
with admixed theta, as well as faster frequencies. The background is variable but not clearly reactive
to noxious stimulation.  There is no posterior dominant rhythm.




State changes are not captured during this study.



Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) sharp waves with triphasic morphology are noted, phase reversing most
often over the right posterior quadrant, but often seen diffusely.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing

2. Background disorganization


3. Frequent sharp waves with triphasic morphology, often localizing to the right posterior quadrant,
but also seen diffusely



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of a moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Sharp waves with triphasic morphology are a nonspecific but pathologic finding that can be seen in
toxic-metabolic states but can also be seen in epileptogenic conditions. Clinical and imaging
correlation is advised in this case, especially given focal nature of sharp waves with triphasic
morphology.  If concern for altered mental status persists, long term monitoring may be of value.




These findings were discussed with the treating team.
