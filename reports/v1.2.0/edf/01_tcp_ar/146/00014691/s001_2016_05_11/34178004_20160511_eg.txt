HISTORY:

43 y.o. male with a history of a recent right MCA stroke.



MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent polymorphic - semirhythmic slow theta activity is captured over the right temporal region.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Continuous EKG artifact is seen.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. Intermittent moderate right temporal focal slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Intermittent focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the right temporal region.



The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
