HISTORY: 66 y.o. male with a history of Localization related epilepsy due to prior left parietal lobar hemorrhage who presented with seizure, now with right hemiparesis referred for routine EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.  MEDICATIONS: DILANTIN ER 300 q12h (level 11), KEPPRA 1000 q12h - inc to 1500 q12h and 1500 mg load, 2MG OF ATIVAN @ 1:42PM  SEDATION: as above  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/9/2016, 17:04 - 11/10/2016, 06:00)  Pt given additional ativan, lacosamide 300 mg IV, then started on 200 mg q12h  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous but asymmetric.  The right hemisphere consists of fairly organized alpha, beta, and theta with posterior dominant rhythm 9 Hz. There is attenuation of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere with a mix of delta and scant beta, which is disorganized.  Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by further background slowing. No sleep transients present.  Mild generalized slowing is present.    PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Near continuous left anterior temporal (F7/T1/T3 max) sharp-and-slow waves present at 1 Hz, with reflection across the left parasagittal and right hemisphere (PLEDS / lateralized periodic discharges / LPDs). These occasionally fluctuate to 2 Hz and develop underlying rhythmicity (LPD+R)  EVENTS:  11/9/2016 at 20:11 (46 sec) - Electrographic seizure Clinical: occurs out of sleep without clinical signs. Patient arouses immediately after electrographic offset EEG: left anterior temporal discharges increase in frequency to 3 Hz before slowing to 2.5, then 2, then 1 Hz EKG: no change  Similar subclinical electrographic seizures occur with duration ranging 10-82 sec  11/9 17:58, 20:50 (while examined by house staff, noted with continued aphasia), 21:13, 22:42    EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 90s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Mild generalized slowing, suboptimal organization 2. Attenuation of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere 3. Near continuous left anterior temporal sharp-and-slow waves present at 1 Hz  4. Electrographic seizures of left anterior temporal origin, ongoing  These findings are diagnostic for localization related epilepsy of left anterior temporal origin superimposed on left hemispheric dysfunction. Degree of diffuse cerebral dysfunction has improved compared with routine EEG performed earlier in the day.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (11/10/2016, 06:00 - 11/11/2016, 06:00)  Phenobarbital 100 mg q4h started, first dose 11/10 12:00 *Study disconnected 11/10 16:51-18:48. Then, patient pulls off all leads 11/11 02:36.  BACKGROUND: as phenobarbital treatment is begun, background becomes slightly slower and more disorganized  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  L anterior temporal LPDs as on day 1. On this day, these discharges occasionally have underlying rhythmic component (LPD+R). As day progresses, these discharges become less pronounced during wakeful state, and in sleep occur every 2-3 sec.  EVENTS:  Subclinical electrographic seizures, similar to day 1, occur with duration ranging 10-40 sec (up till 12:50); past 12:50, duration is shorter: 6-25 sec 11/10 07:31, 07:48, 07:54, 08:04, 08:28, 08:40, 08:55 x2, 09:09, 09:28, 10:00, 10:18, 10:34, 10:35, 10:41, 11:34, 12:50, 20:45, 20:50, 20:56, 21:07, 21:21 x2, 21:41  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in 80s-90s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Left anterior temporal subclinical seizures, with clusters on 11/10 07:31-12:50, then another cluster 20:45-21:41 (second cluster with brief seizures). Mild-moderate generalized slowing, at least in part related to sedating medications  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (11/11/2016, 06:00 - 11/12/2016, 06:00)  *Leads are re-applied 11/11 10:00  BACKGROUND: no change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: mild-moderate  FOCAL SLOWING: no change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: frequent left anterior temporal sharp waves, becoming periodic at every 1-2 seconds in sleep (LPDs)  EVENTS: none  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Mild-moderate generalized slowing, at least in part related to sedating medications Left anterior temporal highly epileptogenic discharges, becoming less prominent over the course of the day   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 4 (11/12/2016, 06:00 - 11/12/2016, 09:30)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change from day 3  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in 90s-100s   DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change from day 3  -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Mild generalized slowing, suboptimal organization, worsening to mild-moderate over the course of the recording 2. Attenuation of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere 3. Left anterior temporal epileptogenic potentials, which become less prominent over the course of the study 4. Electrographic seizures of left anterior temporal origin resolved by day 3   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are diagnostic for localization related epilepsy of left anterior temporal origin superimposed on left hemispheric dysfunction. Diffuse cerebral dysfunction is nonspecific in etiology but at least in part related to a medication effect.  Left anterior temporal seizures cease by day 3.
