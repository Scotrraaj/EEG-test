History:	65 year old man with a history of left ICH and subsequent seizures.
Medications:	patient cannot recall his medications
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
There is subtle right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  The 
posterior dominant rhythm over the right consists of 8.5-9 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity 
with expected AP gradient.  The posterior dominant over the left consists of polymorphic 8-9 Hz 
activity, poorly formed AP gradient and excess polymorphic theta activity.  Theta activity is 
especially pronounced over the left anterior temporal region.  Patient remains awake throughout 
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
does not produce additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, left hemispheric, especially ant temporal region
	No epileptiform discharges
	No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake -only 24-minute EEG due to continuous mild focal left hemispheric 
slowing that is most pronounced over the left anterior temporal region. This finding is indicative of 
a focal structural lesion in this region.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep 
was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional 
information.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~60 bpm.
