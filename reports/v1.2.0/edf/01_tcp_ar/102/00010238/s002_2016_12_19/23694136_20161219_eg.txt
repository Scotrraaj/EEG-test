HISTORY:

63 y.o. female with a hx of asthma, HTN, Anxiety, memory problems, and
episodes of LOC.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


pravastatin (PRAVACHOL) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

TEMAZEPAM PO, Take  by mouth.

Multivitamin,Tx-Iron-Minerals (COMPLETE MULTIVITAMIN) Tablet, daily


aripiprazole (ABILIFY) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily.

alprazolam (XANAX) 0.25 mg tablet, Take 0.25 mg by mouth 2 times daily. Indications: Anxiety



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
