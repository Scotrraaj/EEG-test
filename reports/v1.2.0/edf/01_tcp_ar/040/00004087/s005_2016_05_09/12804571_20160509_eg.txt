HISTORY:

67 y.o. WOMAN WITH A HX OF SZ FOR




MEDICATIONS:

LISINOPRIL, TIMOLOL, GABAPENTIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, KEPPRA



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
mainly theta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.0 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is not present.







During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Mild diffuse slow



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
