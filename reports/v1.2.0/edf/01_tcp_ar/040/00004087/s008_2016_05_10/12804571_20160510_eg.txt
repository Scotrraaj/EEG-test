No current facility-administered medications for this visit.


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with
T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and
included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.  Seizure and spike detection software was utilized



DAY 1 (05/092016  - 5/10/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND:

The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of
theta with a small amount of frontocentral beta



Posterior dominant rhythm was 8 Hz, reactive.



The background is  reactive,  variable.



There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  There is shifting arrhythmic delta
noted primarily in drowsiness, maximal in the temporal regions



Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Prominent wicket noted from either temporal region



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Wicket, sharply contoured slowing but no definitive sharp waves or spikes





EVENTS: None



EKG: A single lead captured HR 50-70 BPM



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Abnormal due to:

1. Somewhat slow and disorganized background


2. shifting slowing



-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 2 (May 10 , 06:00 - 5/11/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: Keppra on hold


INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of
theta with a small amount of frontocentral beta


Posterior dominant rhythm was 8 Hz, reactive.

The background is  reactive,  variable.

There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was limited but characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric
vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.  Prominent shifting slowing can be seen in stage II
sleep Slow wave sleep was not captured.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Occasional to frequent  (1/hour to <1min) high amplitude left anterior temporal and mid temporal
sharp waves or spikes were noted, most remarkably after the seizure at 1 PM



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Wicket



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

SEIZURES/EVENTS:

One clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


12:58 PM



Clinical complex partial seizure: Patient is sitting in a chair, looking at the television.  Initially, she
doesn't seem to be doing much but later in the seizure is characterized by head gentle turning, in
non specific fashion, eye fluttering and staring with poor responsiveness.  35 seconds into the seizure
she shifts slightly and then rocks and nods.  The nodding would be clearly an abnormal behavior. 59
seconds into the seizure her head turns left, eyes flutter and tongue protrudes. A Nurse is present, who
calls the patient at 12:59:31 but the patient does not respond. At the end of of the seizure at  1:00
the patient is not responding to verbal stimuli with head turned to left and few movements of  R hand.




EEG characteristics : 1:57 duration


It begins with rhythmic 4 Hz theta with T1 phase reversal. Within 26 seconds there is bilateral theta
and then the activity in the left starts to increase in frequency to alpha and beta frequency activity.
At 12:59:51 the activity on the left is more periodic delta which clearly involves the left central and
parietal region.  The right hemisphere is also slow.  The seizure starts to build up again at 1:00:20
with a left mid temporal phase reversal.  It then starts to slow at 1:00:44.  The post ictal EEG is
remarkable for significant slowing from the left temporal region




EKG: A single lead captured HR 50-90 BPM, at times irregular



-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 3 (May 11, 2016 06:00 - 5/12/2016, 11:10)



AEDs: Keppra on hold

INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:


The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of
theta with a small amount of frontocentral beta

Posterior dominant rhythm was 8 Hz, reactive.


The background is  reactive,  variable.

There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was limited but characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric
vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.  Prominent shifting slowing can be seen in stage II
sleep Slow wave sleep was not captured.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional (1/hour to <1min) high amplitude left anterior temporal and mid temporal sharp waves or
spikes were noted, most remarkably in drowsiness


Rare right anterior temporal sharp waves are noted in sleep

In this section of the record, most epileptiform activity is noted in sleep particularly between one and
3 AM




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Wicket





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: This was a very drowsy patient with obstructive sleep apnea.  Limited
sleep was noted.  Attempts to keep the patient out of bed so she would be awake during the day and
asleep at night or not very successful



SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



EKG: A single lead captured HR 60-90 occ irregular




--------------------------------------------------------------



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patientÂ’s interictal findings were significant with a somewhat slow
background.  Left temporal sharp waves were noted, particularly on the day the patient had a seizure,
or in sleep.  Rare right temporal sharp waves were noted.





ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient had 1 seizure - she states that she would not typically be aware of the seizure that she
had and she spends much of the day by herself .  This was a relatively prolonged seizure, the initial
localization is left mid anterior temporal.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. complex partial



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Complex partial or localization-related epilepsy



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 3 days with continuous video EEG.




The patient was  weaned off Keppra over the course of theadmission. Topiramate was increased No
other medication changes were made during the hospitalization.







was presented at surgical conference to discuss the possibility of intracranial monitoring /
electrocorticography as a next step in her surgical evaluation.  Given the extent of cerebrovascular
disease that is present on her MRI, medical management or the use of a device are the only 2
reasonable choices at this time.




Of note, better control of her blood pressure and her other atherosclerosis disease risk factors is needed




Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
