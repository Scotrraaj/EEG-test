This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized and consists of 11 Hz alpha activity posteriorly with the expected AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient.  Diffuse excess beta activity is captured.  Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected     IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a normal ~17.5 hours long term video EEG.   Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
