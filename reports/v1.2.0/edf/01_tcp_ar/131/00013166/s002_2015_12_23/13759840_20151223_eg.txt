Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. Some intermittent frontal predominant intermixed beta discharges. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
