HISTORY: 21 y.o.  Man with refractory epilepsy and encephalopathy.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: perampanel Tab 8 mg lacosamide (VIMPAT) tablet 100 mg lacosamide (VIMPAT) 200 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 1,000 mg zonisamide (ZONEGRAN) capsule 400 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.    DAY 1 (09/29/16, 17:32 - 9/30/2016, 11:33)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized mixture of theta, alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present at times. There is excessive 5-7Hz activity in wakefulness.   During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep stage I and II is captured. Deeper stages are seen.  Mild generalized slowing is present.     Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the T3 more than T4 region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. At times this activity was very sharply contoured.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:        Hyperventilation and photic Stimulation are not performed.   EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: 1. Focal slow wave in the left more than right mid-temporal region. 2. Mild diffuse slow waves  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the left more than right mid-temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. In addition there is mild diffuse background slowing.  This finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
