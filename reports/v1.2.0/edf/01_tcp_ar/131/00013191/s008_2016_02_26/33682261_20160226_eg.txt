utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory

record and included a single channel of EKG.  Seizure and spike

detection software was utilized


-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 1 (02/22/2016, 11:00 - 2/25/2016, 06:00)

OXC was reduced.


BACKGROUND: The wake  background is a bit slow with an 8 Hz


alpha. During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation

and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.

Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, POSTS sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



GENERALIZED SLOWING: see above



FOCAL SLOWING: None


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): L wicket, infrequent.



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare (<1hour)  noted primarily in


sleep with bilateral frontal spikes, and some complex spikes. +

Dyshormia


EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 68 BPM


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

No seizures were recorded.


The epileptiform activity noted is bifrontal, noted exclusively

in sleep and has a generalized appearance.






DAY 2 (02/23/2016, 6:00 - 2/24/2016, 06:00)

OXC doses and ZON doses were reduced.

The patient was sleep deprived and exercised on the bedside bike.



BACKGROUND: The wake  background is a bit slow with an 8-9 Hz


alpha. In comparison to the prior day, there is much less theta.

During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, POSTS sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was captured.  REM sleep was noted


GENERALIZED SLOWING: see above



FOCAL SLOWING: None



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): rare theta in transition

to sleep- wicket Left


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare (<1hour)- frontally


predominant polyspike, left frontal max, rare.

EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 68-107 BPM


DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


No seizures were recorded.

Rare spikes in sleep were noted.


Reduction in OXC resulted in reduction in background theta.




DAY 3 (02/24/2016, 6:00 - 2/25/2016, 06:00)


OXC doses and ZON doses were reduced.

The patient was sleep deprived and exercised on the bedside bike.



BACKGROUND: The wake  background includes a  9 Hz alpha. There is

little background theta. During drowsiness, slow rolling eye

movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior


dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, POSTS sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was limited.



GENERALIZED SLOWING: see above



FOCAL SLOWING: None


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare to infrequent (<1hour)

Frontal spike and wave/ poly spike and wave, seen only in sleep,


sometimes with left sided maximum. May occur in pairs, or with

dyshormia


EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60-120 BPM. The patient has


tachycardia when he gets out of bed to bathroom.



DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


No seizures were recorded. The spike and wave activity is more

supportive of a generalized mechanism for seizures than a


temporal lobe onset.





DAY 4 (02/25/2016, 6:00 - 2/26/2016, 06:00)


OXC doses have been reduced, and ZON doses were held

The patient was sleep deprived and exercised on the bedside bike.



BACKGROUND: The wake  background includes a  9 Hz alpha. There

are sections with prominent diffuse theta and slowing of the

alpha to 8 Hz


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye

movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior


dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.

only in sleep.  May occur in pairs, or with

dyshormia



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60-120 BPM. The patient has

tachycardia when he gets out of bed.




DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, POSTS sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was limited.



GENERALIZED SLOWING: see above



FOCAL SLOWING: None


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Infrequent (<1hour)

only in sleep.  May occur in pairs, or with dyshormia. Typically

seen between 3-5 AM, may start with left frontal maxium.



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60-105 BPM. The patient has

tachycardia when he gets out of bed, not worsened by exercise




DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, POSTS sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was limited.



GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change


FOCAL SLOWING: No change



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Interictal epileptiform activity

is typically seen for this patient between 3 AM and 5 AM.

In this section of the record, epileptiform activity appears as

early as 2 AM.  Previously described of frontally predominant


spike and slow-wave activity with a left frontal maximum is once

again seen.


In addition, between 2 AM and 3 AM,- frontally predominant 4-5 Hz

spike and wave and polyspike and wave activity is noted.  Some of

these discharges have a left frontal maximum.

Isolated frontal spike and wave activity was also seen at 7 AM,


or out of drowsiness, rather than exclusively in sleep.

Polyspike and slow wave complexes were noted, again some with a


left frontal maximum




EVENTS: When the patient was interviewed on the morning of the


28th, he reported that he knew he was going to have a seizure on

the EEG #27th because he felt an aura when he went to the


bathroom.

18:40:20- the patient was in the bathroom for 2 minutes.  The EEG

demonstrates a normal awake pattern with lambda.  The EKG

demonstrates sinus tachycardia.  No ictal changes can be


identified



Seizure: 3:37 AM 1:16 minutes

EEG: The seizure begins with a burst of delta, maximum in the

left hemisphere.  1 second later, there is a brief burst of 15 Hz

beta activity and then 1 second of theta.  After this, the EEG is


obscured with the characteristic pattern of a tonic-clonic

seizure with tonic muscle artifact and then tonic-clonic jerking.


If the seizure ends, the overall background is suppressed with

periodic delta from the right hemisphere.

Behavior: The patient is asleep, the first clinical finding is

eye opening , then head turns to  and arms extend, eyes deviate


to left as arms extend, then vocalizes, figure of 4 posture with

L arm flexed seen at  3:37:37, by 3:37:42 tonic extension of both


arms is followed by clonic  Activity at 3:38:06, then R arm stiff

and left arm jerking.  Later in the seizure, the patient has eye

deviation to the right. Ictal activity slows at 3:38:19 when R

Periodic delta was noted.


EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 78-120

The patient seems to be post ictal or asleep until 4:19 AM.




A prolonged postictal state was noted.  During the prolonged

postictal state the EEG demonstrated a delta pattern.  The


patient was not able to speak and had difficulty interacting with

the nurse


Seizure: 05:43:15 1:20 minutes

EEG: The seizure does not have the same clear burst of delta,  in


the left hemisphere, rather starts with a brief burst of 15 Hz

beta activity and then 1 second of theta.  After this, the EEG is


obscured with the characteristic pattern of a tonic-clonic

seizure with tonic muscle artifact and then tonic-clonic jerking.


If the seizure ends, the overall background is suppressed with

periodic delta from the right hemisphere.

Behavior: The patient is asleep, the first clinical finding is

eye opening , then head turns to  and arms extend, eyes deviate


to left as arms extend, then vocalizes, figure of 4 posture(

5:43:51) with  L arm flexed seen at  , by tonic extension of both


arms is followed by clonic activity  then R arm stiff and left

arm jerking.  Later in the seizure, the patient has eye deviation

to the right. Ictal ctivity slows at 5:44:04  And bilateral

Periodic delta was noted, transitioning to R focal delta. Marked


background attenuation follows this seizure

EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 78-120




DAY 6 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



2 electrographic seizures were recorded out of sleep.  These are

generalized in nature.  There may be a burst of left frontal


delta at the onset of the seizures.  Both were tonic-clonic

seizures.  The patient described these as less severe than his

typical seizure and that he wasn't a sore and didn't bite his

tongue.  He did not have any sort of aura prior to the seizure or


any kind of arousal









-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 7 (02/28, 06:00 - 2/29/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND: No change



GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change



FOCAL SLOWING: None


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Interictal epileptiform activity


is typically seen for this patient between 3 AM and 5 AM.

However, in this section of the record, epileptiform activity

appears in drowsiness and sleep outside of that time frame.

Previously described of frontally predominant


spike and slow-wave activity with a left frontal maximum is once

again seen.


In addition,frontally predominant 4-5 Hz

spike and wave and polyspike and wave activity is noted.  Some of

these discharges have a left frontal maximum.



Polyspike and slow wave complexes were noted, again some with a

left frontal maximum.



Finally, clearly left frontal duets of focal sharps or spikes

were noted.

EVENTS:


Seizure: 10:59 AM 1:15 minutes

The seizure starts with theta and sharply from the left temporal


region followed by 4 Hz theta with T1 maximum and T1 sharp waves.

This is followed by a tonic clonic seizure, again with EEG

obscured by muscle artifact but with the characteristic

tonic-clonic pattern.  Periodic delta is noted at the end of the


Seizure.  Prolonged post ictal slowing was again seen.

EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60-140



DAY MPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



The interictal activity and seizures are similar to prior


discharges.








-----------------------------------------------------------------



FINAL IMPRESSION:


This is an avnormal video EEG due to:



1. Three Tonic clonic seizures, with similar electrographic

pattern, without definitive focal onset.


2. Frontal spike and wave, poly spike and wave activity often

with left frontal maximum.

3. Isolated left frontal sharp waves or spikes.

4. Intermittently slow background or slowing of alpha to 8 Hz,


ameliorated in part by elimination by cessation of OXC.

5.  Intermittent tachycardia at rest.




FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are diagnostic for a generalized seizure disorder

and are more supportive of a secondarily generalized process
