DATE OF STUDY: 07/08/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only





HISTORY:

 a 55 y.o. male p/w post op infection fever, increased LLE weakness and falls. S/p
right temporal lobe GBM resection x3 on 6/15. Drain placed in between C4 and F4. Prior LTm study.
PMH: Epilepsy, CAD, HTN





MEDICATIONS:


Keppra, Oxycodone, Metoprolol, Protonix, Cefepime, Morphone, Ofirmev, Lipitor, Vancomycin


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




BACKGROUND:



The waking background is reactive but asymmetric.

The left hemisphere consists of theta, delta with an absent anterior-posterior


gradient. The right hemisphere consists of low voltage delta

Frequencies.



There is continuous right hemispheric slowing and attenuation of

fast frequencies.



Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the
recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.



Sleep is characterized by further slowing of the background.




PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. None



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single lead captured


DAY 1 IMPRESSION :


This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

1. Moderate diffuse slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Continuous right hemispheric slowing and attenuation of fast


frequencies.

3. Continuous frontally-maximal triphasic waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are consistent with right hemispheric dysfunction

superimposed on moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Triphasic wave are indicative of a diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but
suggestive of a metabolic origin.




There are no clinical or electrographic seizures

reported or detected.
