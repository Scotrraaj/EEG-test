History:	55 year old man who presents with change in mental status.  Patient has a history of
	 GBM, status post resection in 2015.
	
	Patient is agitated early the recording.
Medications:	Keppra, Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower 
waveforms over the right.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta 
activity with occasional-intermittent triphasics waveforms.  There is paucity of faster frequencies 
over the right.  No normal sleep architecture is present but periods of quiescence are seen.
  No electrographic seizures are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart 
rate of ~ 120 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, moderate-to-severe
	Triphasic waves, intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable 1 hour EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing, 
continuous right hemispheric moderate-to-severe focal slowing, and intermittent triphasic 
waveforms. These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy, which is 
etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.  Continuous focal is indicative of a 
focal structural lesion over the right.  Triphasic waves are a nonspecific EEG finding that can be 
seen in encephalopathy (most notably hepatic), uremia and anoxia.  No clinical or electrographic
