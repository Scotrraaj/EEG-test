HISTORY:

49 y.o. WOMAN WITH HX OF MOYAMOYA DX. STROKE LEFT ARM.
EEG TO EVALUATE. FOLLOW UP EEG.  LAST SZ  2 MONTHS AGO PT HAD A STARRING SPELL
WITH WEAKNESS LASTING LESS THAN A MIN.





MEDICATIONS:


KEPPRA, TOPAMAX




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Continuous focal slowing in the right midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:




1. Continuous focal slow in the right midtemporal region

2. Intermittent focal slow in the left midtemporal region.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to continuous focal slow in the right
midtemporal region and intermittent focal slow in the left midtemporal region.  This findings are
consistent with the known strokes. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
