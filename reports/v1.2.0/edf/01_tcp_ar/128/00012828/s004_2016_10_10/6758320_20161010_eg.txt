HISTORY:

64 y.o. MAN P/W 2 BACK TO BACK SZ AND RIGHT SIDED WEAKNESS.


PMH: LEFT MCA INFARCT (PARIETAL/TEMPORAL) JAN. 2015.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 750 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

LORazepam (ATIVAN) tablet 2 mg

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg


docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg

heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 80 mg


cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN) 1 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+








SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to intermittent muscles artifact from shivering and included a single channel of EKG and photic
stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
There is additional superimposed diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 14-25Hz activity is also seen.





Sleep is not captured


Moderate to severe generalized slow waves are seen.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

Occular stimulation reveals muscle reactivity.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:




1. Moderate to severe generalized slow waves are seen.

2. Excessive beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal coma routine EEG due to these findings moderate diffuse background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
