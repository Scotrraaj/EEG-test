HISTORY:

66 y.o. female with a history of TBI,

cognitive impairment, transferred to Neurology for episode of


facial twitching,  referred for routine EEG for characterization

of seizures. Imaging demonstrates: Mild to moderate generalized

parenchymal volume loss with commensurate ventricular and sulcal


prominence is noted. Encephalomalacia and

gliosis in the left frontal lobe with ex-vacuo dilatation a of

the left frontal horn



MEDICATIONS:

Current  Prescriptions:


potassium chloride (KLOR-CON) 20 mEq packet, Take 20 mEq by mouth

2 times daily.

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2


times daily. ( Held today)




morphine (MS CONTIN) 15 mg 12 hr tablet, Take 15 mg by mouth 2

times daily.


aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.

CYCLOBENZAPRINE HCL (CYCLOBENZAPRINE PO), Take  by mouth.


BUSPIRONE HCL (BUSPAR PO), Take  by mouth.

multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth

daily.

Gabapentin 300 mg



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and auditory stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is abnormal, characterized by the presence

symmetric mixture of alpha but also bursts of bilateral,


irregular delta, with a symmetric and reactive 8.0 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior


gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,rare sleep spindles. Slow

wave sleep was not captured.



Generalized slowing is present.

Focal slowing is present.


L frontal / frontocentral with disruption of faster frequency

activity



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Rare (<1hour)  Left frontal sharp waves were noted.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

? Triphasic waves

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal  routine EEG due to:

1. Slowing and disorganization


2.  L frontocentral focal slowing

3. Rare, simple frontal sharp waves - left



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are suggestive of a bihemispheric process and may

be correlated with imaging, clinical history and exam.  Sharp


waves suggest a potential for seizures in this adult with TBI.
