HISTORY:

a 30 y.o. female with a history of IV drug

abuse referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status


change.


MEDICATIONS: versed, propofol, ceftriaxone, vancomycin



SEDATION: as above



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The background is continuous and symmetric but not clearly

reactive to sternal rub. It consists of a disorganized mixture of


mostly beta activity, with occasional admixed delta. There is no

posterior dominant rhythm. There is no clear state change.



Severe generalized slowing is present.

There is no focal slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 114 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:


1. Severe generalized slowing and background disorganization,

with lack of reactivity


2. Tachycardia


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral


dysfunction, which may at least in part be due to a medication

effect. A background consisting of mostly beta activity can be


seen in the setting of propofol and/or versed.

Tachycardia is captured on a single EKG lead.
