DATE OF STUDY: 01/03/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 28 y.o. female with a history of R fronto-temporal tumor s/p removal 2003,
seizures (last 1 mo ago), and continuous nausea and occasional vomiting referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


nortriptyline (PAMELOR) 10 mg capsule, Take 10 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol (SPRINTEC, 28,) 0.25-35 mg-mcg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth
daily.


Amphetamine-Dextroamphetamine (AMPHETAMINE-DEXTROAMPHETAMINE) 30 mg Tablet, Take
30 mg by mouth daily.


FLUOXETINE HCL (FLUOXETINE PO), Take  by mouth.

mometasone (NASONEX) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray, Inhale 2 sprays into the nose daily.

CETIRIZINE HCL (ALLERGY RELIEF, CETIRIZINE, PO), Take  by mouth.


OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 300 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

There is continuous right mid-temporal (T3 max) polymorphic slowing, often higher in amplitude
than left side and sharply contoured, consistent with breach rhythm.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.






HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Continuous right mid-temporal (T3 max) polymorphic slowing, often higher in amplitude than left
side and sharply contoured, consistent with breach rhythm.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a right temporal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in
etiology.

Breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known skull defect.
