SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.


Parents play the music throughout the entire recording.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.



The background consists of a mixture of a very low amplitude polymorphic theta, delta and beta
activity.



Patient remains awake throughout the recording.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform discharges are captured.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

Multiple events of independent brief leg and arm tremors are captured.  None are correlated with an
abnormal ictal activity or represent patient's events of interest.



A single clinical/ electrographic seizure is captured.  Clinically, it starts ~ 40 seconds after music
starts.  Clinically, it starts with a single loud forceful cough, followed by either tongue thrusting or
teeth grinding (video is not clear).  Patient is also not as animated throughout the event.  He has
several more single loud coughs and some slow eye blinking by the end.  The exact event offset is
not clear.


Electrographically, first change appears several seconds after a cough.  It is characterized by increase
in amplitude and prominence of diffuse fast activity.  It is then replaced by rhythmic spiky ~8 Hz
theta activity that is most pronounced over left hemisphere, specifically frontocentraltemporal leads.
This theta gradually slows down and stops.  EEG change lasts ~ 47 seconds and clinical event lasts
~1 min 57 seconds.





Heart rate increases from ~ 84 bpm prior to the episode to ~120 bpm during the episode.


HEART RATE:


A resting heart rate of ~80s-90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  When the patient becomes
animated, excited, has limb/ body tremors, his heart rate rapidly rises to 120-140 bpm range.





IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake- only  3 hour EEG due to:

1. Diffuse slowing


2. A single clinical and electrographic seizure that starts ~ 40 seconds after music is turned on, has
diffuse onset, electrographically settles over the right and electrographically stops more than 1
minute before clinical symptoms subside






Diffuse slowing is indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
