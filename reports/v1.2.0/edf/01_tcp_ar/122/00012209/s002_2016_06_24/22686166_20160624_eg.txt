DATE OF STUDY: 06/24/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 52 y.o. female with a history of asthma and seizures since age 31, last seizure 3 wks
ago, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 50 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. One at bed for two
weeks, then one twice daily


omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule,

naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet,


loratadine (CLARITIN) 10 mg tablet,

ANTI-DIARRHEAL, LOPERAMIDE, 2 mg tablet,

ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet,


DOC-Q-LACE 100 mg capsule,

VENTOLIN HFA 90 mcg/actuation inhaler,

MAPAP EXTRA STRENGTH 500 mg tablet,




phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 3 capsules by mouth nightly. (Patient taking
differently: Take 300 mg by mouth 4 times daily.)



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
occasional alpha and excess beta frequencies, with occasional fragments of a symmetric and reactive
9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Rare right anterior temporal (F8/T2>T4) spikes

2. Frequent left anterior temporal (T1>F7/T3) sharp-and-wave discharges



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG due to:


1. Rare right anterior temporal (F8/T2>T4) spikes

2. Frequent left anterior temporal (T1>F7/T3) sharp-and-wave discharges



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of left anterior temporal > right anterior temporal epileptogenic
potentials.


Excess beta can be seen in the setting of a medication effect.




Attending Epileptologist: 


I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
