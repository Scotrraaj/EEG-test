HISTORY:

54 y.o. male with a history of left-sided temporal-parietal glioblastoma
multiforme s/p craniotomy, debulking, and radiation therapy in 2008. Recently treated with
chemotherapy, now with episodes of feeling off-balance and falling for one week. He has a history of
epilepsy that precedes development of the brain tumor, as well as an episode of status epilepticus in
2014.  He is here for screening for subclinical seizures.

TECHNIQUE:

A beside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


There were more than 14 seizures noted in this 60-minute study.



The EEG begins with the patient resting comfortably. There is a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm on the right,
disrupted on the left. There is generous beta noted bilaterally. There is rhythmic slowing seen from
the left hemisphere. In between seizures, the patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep with
vertex waves and sleep spindles. Seizures range in duration from 1.5 to 2 minutes.




Generalized slowing is present.


Right-sided focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


In addition to the 14 seizures, there are intermittent sharp waves noted in the left hemisphere,
including F7, T1, T3.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: The technologist tested the patient during the seizures. Each time, the
patient was alert and responsive during the ictal changes.



EVENTS:

There were numerous electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep EEG due to:

1. Approximately 14 electrographic seizures were recorded during this study. Ictal patterns included:

Repetitive sharp waves and theta from P3.

Repetitive epileptiform activity maximum at C3.


Repetitive sharps in P3-O1.

T3-T5 rhythmic buzz of 6 or 9 Hz.


2. Seizure onset and offset was sometimes difficult to determine. Seizure duration typically was 1.5
minutes, sometimes longer or shorter. None longer than 4 minutes.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are indicative of status epilepticus.
