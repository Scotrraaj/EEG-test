DATE OF STUDY: 06/30/16


RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient

EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep



HISTORY:

a 61 y.o. male with a history of HIV, HCV, mesial temporal sclerosis, sepsist  referred for
routine EEG for characterization of seizures. Admitted with sepsis and recurrent seizures.



MEDICATIONS:



EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR (TRUVADA PO), Take  by mouth daily.

LEVETIRACETAM (KEPPRA PO), Take 1,000 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


PHENOBARBITAL PO, Take  by mouth.

Others:



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


Bedside  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized an asymmetry. On the left it is organized with a mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.





Continuous right focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Attenuation of faster frequency on right

2. Right focal slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are suggestive of a structural or functional process on the right involving gray and
white matter. No epileptiform features.
