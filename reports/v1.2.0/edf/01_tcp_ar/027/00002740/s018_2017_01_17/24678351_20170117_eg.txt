DATE OF STUDY: 01/17/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 61 y.o. male with a history of EPILEPSY AND LIVER TRANSPLANT, CHRONIC
HCV, CAD, AND CARDIOMYOPATHY referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.

days.

albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs
every 6 hours as needed for Wheezing.

Calcium Carbonate-Vit D3-Min (CALCIUM-VITAMIN D) 600 mg calcium- 400 unit Tablet, Take 2
tablets by mouth daily. 600mg am & 1200mg in pm


MULTIVITAMIN (MULTIPLE VITAMIN PO), Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5-9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slowing of and occasional attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:






Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and early drowsy routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and early drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

If clinically warranted, a recording with stage II sleep may be helpful.


Bradycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.
