HISTORY:

60 y.o. male with a history of JME and

possible focal seizures, presenting with fever and altered mental


status; referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status

change.



MEDICATIONS: MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL, ALBUTEROL, VANCOMYCIN,

KEPPRA, VIMPAT, HEPARIN, LASIX, ASA, SIROLIMUS, THERAGRAN,

PLAVIX, PRAVACHOL, PROTONIX



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was at times a technically difficult study,




with muscle artifact obscuring the temporal chains. It included a

single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous and symmetric but consists of

fairly organized sharply contoured delta and theta frequencies,

with admixed faster frequencies. Delta frequencies are seen more

posteriorly.  Fragments of an irregular posterior dominant rhythm


approach 6-7 Hz.



Drowsiness is characterized by further background slowing.

Sleep transients are not captured.


Moderate generalized slowing is present.


There is frequent bilateral posterior quadrant polymorphic

slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional diffuse frontally predominant polyspikes with shifting

predomiance.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm, with frequent PVCs, is captured on a

single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate generalized slowing

2. Suboptimal organization

3. Frequent bilateral posterior quadrant polymorphic slowing


4. Occasional diffuse frontally predominant polyspikes with

shifting predominance


5. A heart rate of 90 with frequent PVCs is captured on a single

EKG lead


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of diffuse epileptogenic

potential superimposed on bilateral posterior quadrant


dysfunction and moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

Frequent PVCs are seen on a single EKG lead.
