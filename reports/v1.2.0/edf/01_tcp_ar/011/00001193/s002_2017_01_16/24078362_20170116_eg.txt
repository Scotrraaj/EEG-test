DATE OF STUDY: 01/16/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only




HISTORY:

a 22 y.o. MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O CONGENITAL HYDROCEPHALUS
SECONDARY TO BACTERIAL MENINGITIS, MIXED SZ DISORDER, CEREBRAL PALSY.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 3350 (MIRALAX PO), Take  by mouth.

DIAZEPAM (DIASTAT ACUDIAL RE), Place  rectally.


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 750 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

ranitidine (ZANTAC) 75 mg tablet, Take 75 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

chlorhexidine (PERIDEX) 0.12 % solution, Take 15 mLs by mouth 2 times daily.


baclofen (LIORESAL) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth nightly.

fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray, Inhale 1 spray into the nose daily.

Bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) 10 mg suppository, Place 10 mg rectally as needed.


Sodium Chloride-Aloe Vera (AYR SALINE) Gel, Apply  topically. Apply for  Nose bleeds





pedi multivit #33-NaF-Fe,carb (POLY-VI-FLOR WITH IRON) 0.5 mg fluoride -10mg iron Tablet,
Chewable, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


Sodium Phosphates (SODIUM PHOSPHATE) 9.5-3.5 gram/59 mL Enema, Place  rectally.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to almost continuous patient movement and included a single channel of EKG and photic
stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was very characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta  activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.



continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the T5 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Very frequent T5 sharp waves (some with a more anterior T3 field) at times in rhythmic runs with no
clear evolution.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Left posterior temporal sharp waves at times in runs


2. Left posterior temporal continuous focal slow waves

3. Moderate generalized slow wave and disorganization


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal limited routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing and sharp waves in the left
posterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal structural cerebral dysfunction
and irritability in this region. In addition there is moderate diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
