HISTORY:

37 y.o. male with a history of GSW TO LEFT

SIDE OF HEAD BEHIND LEFT EAR IN 1999. PT DEVELOPED SZ'S SHORTLY


AFTERWARD. MOST RECENT SZ 1  WEEKS AGO AURA DIZZY AND THEN WOKE

UP AND WAS IN AMBULANCE PT.STATES HE DD NOT TAKE MEDS  AND

THOUGHT HE WOULD BE OK, known gliosis and encephalomalacia in the


left cerebellum and

parasagittal medial occipital lobe:routine EEG for

characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL XR) 400 mg 12 hr tablet, Take 2 tablets

by mouth 2 times daily.

levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1.5 tablets by mouth


2 times daily.





No current facility-administered medications for this visit.





SEDATION:


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and

photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

low-voltage, mixed frequency but a symmetric and reactive pattern


with scant 9  Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is

present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mildgeneralized slowing is present.

Focal slowing is present.  See below


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Elicits rhythmic, focal slowing from the


left, particularly left frontal/frontotemporal


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Subtle left focal slowing characterized by a focal


hyperventilation response



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with

structural abnormalities as described above.  This is one of many

EEGs for this patient who has a previous one-hour EEG and a


previous 20 minute EEG.  The left focal features described above

were seen in one of the studies.  In aggregate, only one sharp


wave has ever been recorded for this adult.
