HISTORY:

25 y.o. female with a history of refractory epilepsy referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures. Recent exacerbation of seizures



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

clobazam Tab 20 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) tablet 200 mg

carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) tablet 300 mg


LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

brivaracetam Tab 100 mg

brivaracetam Tab 50 mg


ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg



Keppra d/c'd



SEDATION: None

TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  Challenging
bedside record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal  stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a  disorganized symmetric mixture of
theta alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained



Moderate generalized slowing is present.

Shifting focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Sharply contoured slowing in context of many artifacts as well, T1 or T2



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Sharply contoured slowing, L or R but also artifacts



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none

EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Slow and disorganized pattern




2. Sharply contoured shifting slowing

3. Sharply contoured delta, seen on R or Left



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings may represent a post ictal EEG. This study is slower than prior and should be
correlated with imaging.
