HISTORY: 25 y.o. female with a history of Nodular heterotopia, refractory epilepsy, referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures. Recent worsening of seizures, confusion, weakness   MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: clobazam Tab 20 mg     carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) tablet 200 mg carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) tablet 300 mg LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg brivaracetam Tab 100 mg ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg Keppra held  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  Technically more or less satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.  DAY 1 ( 10/11/2016   - 10/12/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is  continuous, well-organized, and consists predominantly of alpha with admixed theta and beta Posterior dominant rhythm was present- 8.5 Hz. The background is  reactive,  variable. There were shifting asymmetries in frequency- shifting temporal focal slowing, L>R. Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles. PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  L TIRDA- seen at 7:45 PM and 5:38 AM, the later in Stage II sleep Rare (<1hour) initially, more prominent later, independent R o r L temporal sharp waves, T1 , T2  EVENTS: None  EKG: A single lead captured 60-90 BPM  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Technically limited but disorganized and somewhat slow background TIRDA Independent R or L temporal sharps Shifting temporal slowing, primarily with left temporal sharply contoured focal slowing. Limited by significant electrode artifact and potential issues with lead placement following MRI.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2(10/12/2016, 06:00 - 10/13/2016, 06:00)  AEDs: Brivact started after the seizure in the PM  INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:  The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is  symmetric and reaches 9 Hz.  Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) sleep. Wake, high amplitude with variable maxima- A1/T1/T3/F7 some with posterior spread. Ranging from high amplitude to small, discrete with frontal maxima L TIRDA OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none SEIZURES/EVENTS: There are clinical or electrographic events captured during this study. 1. Seizure 3:43 PM 2:07 duration. Patient is working with nurse, she has motion arrest, then chewing movements. Her R arm is flexed. The nurse determines that the patient is unresponsive and calls for RN. Testing is performed after the event ends and patient is briefly confused. Patient recalls aura of nausea, then post ictal state. She does not recall even attempting to push button before event was over.  EEG: Awake, then diffuse fronto-temporal fast, then repetitive delta, then theta, high amplitude, with clear frequency evolution and notched delta L FT- terminates abruptly. Brief post ictal slowing. Patient then retches. HR increases to 100 prior to event, 120 during event, with few PVCs after.  EKG: A single lead captured 90 Impression: Abnormal- ongoing left temporal focal features and one clear clinical seizure.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3(10/13/2016, 06:00 - 10/14/2016, 14:00)  Current Facility-Administered Medications:  •  brivaracetam Tab 50 mg, 50 mg, Oral, Q12H, 50 mg at 10/14/16 0558 •  cloBAZam Tab 20 mg, 20 mg, Oral, BID, 20 mg at 10/14/16 1028 •  Insert Peripheral IV, , , 1 Time **AND** Saline Lock IV, , , 1 Time **AND** sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL, 10 mL, IV Push, Q8H SCH, 10 mL at 10/14/16 0558 •  enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg, 40 mg, Subcutaneous, Daily, 40 mg at 10/14/16 1027 •  carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) tablet 200 mg, 200 mg, Oral, Daily, 200 mg at 10/14/16 1028 •  carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) tablet 300 mg, 300 mg, Oral, QHS, 300 mg at 10/13/16 2143 •  LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg, 2 mg, Intravenous, Q6H PRN,  •  ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg, 4 mg, Injection, Q6H PRN, 4 mg at 10/11/16 1753 •  acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg, 650 mg, Oral, Q6H PRN, 650 mg at 10/11/16 1753 BP 90/56 (BP Location: Right arm, Patient Position: Lying)  Pulse 82  Temp 97.5 °F (36.4 °C) (Oral)  Resp 20  Ht 5' 2.99" (1.6 m)  Wt 125 lb (56.7 kg)  LMP  (LMP Unknown)  SpO2 98%  Breastfeeding?
