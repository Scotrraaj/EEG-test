HISTORY:

This is a 42 y.o. left handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is
not a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9, T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies.  Lambda
waves are seen in wakefulness.








During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed



EVENTS:

The daytime technician told the rounding team that "around 2 am" on 6/15 the patient got out of
bed to use the bathroom and reported dizziness and right sided numbness.  The entire record was
reviewed, end-to-end, with particular attention to arousals from 01:45-03:00.  The patient remained
asleep with normal background.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate in the 80s is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep video EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. A posterior dominant rhythm consisting of low
voltage fast frequencies can be a normal variant in the adult population.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal study.

Episode that was reported around 2 am on 6/15/2016 has no EEG correlate.







-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 2 (6/15/2016, 06:00 - 6/16/2016, 06:00)


AEDs 6/15/2016: Keppra 1000 mg in AM, 500 mg HS



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: no change



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


SEIZURES/EVENTS:

(1) DATE AND TIME:   6/15/2016 at 10:05


EVENT TYPE: Event of unclear etiology

CLINICAL: Patient is in bathroom, tells nurse she feels dizzy and that whole right side feels numb. At
10:05 patient seen on camera helped into bed by nurse. Patient uses her right arm to lift her right leg
into bed.


EEG: No EEG changes from background, aside from movement artifact, were seen


DURATION: unclear

POSTICTAL CHANGES:  No change

EKG: no change in a single EKG lead; heart rate in low 100s before and during event



(2) DATE AND TIME:   6/15/2016 at 11:06

EVENT TYPE: Non-epileptic event


CLINICAL: Patient is lying in bed and appears uncomfortable restless; fidgeting with both hands. She
has a few isolated body jerks. She appears as though she is searching for the event button without
moving her head. She utters a few brief moans. Tech comes into room and asks "are you ok?" Patient
does not answer, but isolated body jerks become more frequent. Tech presses button. Body jerking,
now side-to-side, becomes higher in amplitude. Eyes are closed. Patient does not follow commands.
At 11:10, jerks increase in amplitude to become rhythmic shaking with side-to-side head movements,
which gradually decrease in frequency, become lower in amplitude, and become irregular at offset.
Patient has urinary incontinence and postictal confusion.






EEG: No EEG changes from background, aside from movement artifact, were seen preceding or
following the part of the episode that involve violent shaking. Violent shaking has only electrode
movement artifact as correlate.


DURATION: 6 min 29 sec


POSTICTAL CHANGES:  No change

EKG: heart rate increases from 90 bpm baseline to 120s immediately after shaking resolves



EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in 70s-100s


DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Normal background.

The 2 episodes described above are most consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events.





-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 3 (6/16/2016, 06:00 - 6/17/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: Keppra STOPPED


INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: no change



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps), performed
6/16/2016 at 11:30, induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.




Sleep Deprivation: Patient is sleep deprived until 6/17/2016 03:00



SEIZURES/EVENTS:


(1) DATE AND TIME:   6/16/2016 at 12:29

EVENT TYPE: Non-epileptic event


CLINICAL: patient is sitting in chair and starts to fidget with hands, looking for button, which she
pushes 1 min later. Tech immediately comes in and asks, "You don't feel good?" Patient shakes
head "no." Sways back and forth with eyes closed and appears to be nauseas. She then develops
flexion-extension movements of trunk with side to side head shaking. She is able to remain seated in
the chair. Tech is able to suppress the movements with palpation. Eyes are open and fluttering.
Within 45-60 seconds shaking becomes more irregular and less violent. She does not follow
commands. She continues to have irregular low amplitude body jerks for several minutes after the
violent shaking has stopped. By 12:34 she attends and responds verbally. She cannot remember the
code word.



EEG: No EEG changes from background, aside from movement artifact, were seen preceding or
following the part of the episode that involve violent shaking. Violent shaking has only electrode
movement artifact as correlate.



DURATION: violent shaking lasted 45 min; entire event ~7 min

-----------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patients interictal findings were normal, with a posterior dominant
rhythm consisting of low voltage fast frequencies, without any focal findings or epileptiform
discharges.



ICTAL FINDINGS:


The patient had 2 clinical events that were representative of her typical habitual events at home.
They were semiologically and electrographically consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events.
Two additional clinical events of  "dizziness with right sided numbness" also had no electrographic
correlate, and also consistent with nonepileptic events.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Nonepileptic behavioral events



CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video EEG.  This
was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of events.



The interictal EEG is normal.








The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of his admission. As the EEG remained normal
without focal features or epileptiform discharges, the patient was counseled about the diagnosis of
nonepileptic behavioral events and that Keppra is not indicated to treat these.  She is to continue off
Keppra.




We recommend that she to see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying
psychopathology and diagnosis.
