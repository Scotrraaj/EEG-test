HISTORY:

73 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH DECREASED MENTAL STATUS.AND
WORSENING RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS.    PMHX: TBI/ WITH RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized mixture of alpha and
beta frequencies, with a reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) seen only on the right side.



The left hemisphere reveals continuous theta /delta focal slowing maximal in the frontal region. No
clear PDR is seen



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with  vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-
complexes seen best over the right hemisphere. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Left hemispheric focal slow waves seen continuously. At times these are very sharply contoured with
one suspicious discharge.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Left hemisphere continuous focal slow waves maximal in the frontal region and lack of PDR.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:









This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to continuous left hemisphere continuous
focal slow waves maximal in the frontal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral
dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin. The suspicious sharply contoured discharge on
the left is of unclear significance.
