HISTORY:

57 y.o.MAN WITH CC OF SEIZURES.  HAS BEEN SZ FREE OVER 1 YR.
(NOCTURNAL SZS),  EVALUATION TO STOP AED



PM: ASTHMA



MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the F8 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F7/T3 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.






IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep 1hr EEG due to:


1. Continuous focal slowing in the right frontotemporal region

2. Intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep 1 hr EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the right
frontotempora region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region,
likely structural in origin. In addition there is intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior temporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. No
seizures were seen.
