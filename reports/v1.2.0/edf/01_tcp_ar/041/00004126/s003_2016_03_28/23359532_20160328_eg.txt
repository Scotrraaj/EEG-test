HISTORY:

54 y.o. WOMAN R HANDED PT ADMITTED ON

FRIDAY FOR SZ WITNESSED IN ED. PT SAYS SHE HAS NOT HAD SZ IN YRS.


PMHX DM TYPE 2


MEDICATIONS:


KEPPRA


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



Intermittent to frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in


the right more than left fronto- temporal region during

wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness and at times becoming

more rhythmic.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Intermittent focal slowing in the right more than left


fronto-temporal region.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in

these regions, which is etiologically non-specific.

No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
