HISTORY:

This is a 38 y.o. female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring
with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patientÂ’s exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

losartan-hydrochlorothiazide (HYZAAR) 100-12.5 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.


SEDATION: None



DAY 1



BACKGROUND:






The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of 10
Hz alpha activity posteriorly with the expected AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient.



There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was characterized by symmetric sleep spindles and/or K-complexes.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal ~16 hour continuous video audio EEG monitoring with no events captured.



-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 2



AEDs: Keppra dose decreased

Induction: sleep deprivation



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reaches 10 Hz.







Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep and REM sleep is captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


SEIZURES/EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


EKG: A single lead captured heart rate of 60 bpm.





-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 3



AEDs: Keppra OFF


INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:


The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reaches 10 Hz.


Sleep architecture is normal.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



SEIZURES/EVENTS:



There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 4



AEDs: Keppra OFF

Induction: sleep deprivation



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 5



AEDs: Keppra off


INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reaches 10 Hz.



Sleep architecture is normal.

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

INDUCTION PROCEDURES:

Exercise



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:

Interictal Findings:  Normal awake and asleep recording.




Ictal Findings:

The patient had no clinical events while on continuous video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy
monitoring unit.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Not established



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Not established


CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video
EEG.  This was an inconclusive EMU monitoring session because of no events were captured.



The interictal EEG is characterized by normal awake and asleep background with regular heart rate
while monitored on telemetry.





The patient was weaned off Keppra over the course of her admission. She was NOT restarted on her
medication at the time of her discharge.




Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
