HISTORY:

22 y.o. male with a history of seizures

referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet, Take 750 mg by mouth 2

times daily.

multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth


daily.

polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) 17 gram packet, Take 17 g by mouth

daily.


melatonin 3 mg Tablet, Take 3 mg by mouth at bedtime.

DIAZEPAM (DIASTAT RE), Place 10 mg rectally as needed.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.







SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

Patient moves throughout the recording.  The recording is filled

with continuous high amplitude EMG and movement artifacts that

significantly limit EEG interpretation.  Fragmented 10-11 Hz


moderate amplitude posterior alpha activity is captured.



Patient remains awake throughout the recording.


Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No clear epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional


abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A regular heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


Technically limited

No seizures


No sleep


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is a technically limited awake-only 21-minute EEG due to

continuous high amplitude EMG and movement artifacts that


significantly limit EEG interpretation.  No clear seizures are

captured.
