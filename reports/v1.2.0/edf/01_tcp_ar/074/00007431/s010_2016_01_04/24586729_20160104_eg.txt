No current facility-administered medications for this visit.






SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.  The

patient has a craniotomy defect on the right.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is abnormal and somewhat disorganized.


There is a 7-8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm present bilaterally,

sometimes disrupted on the right.  Arrhythmic delta is noted in

the right mid to posterior temporal region.  A breach rhythm is

noted on the right with exenteration of beta activity in that


region.  In addition, they're intermittent bursts of generalized,

paroxysmal slowing noted in wakefulness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.






Sleep is characterized by vertex waves K complexes and spindles.


Sleep is somewhat asynchronous, more remarkable in the right

hemisphere




Generalized slowing is present.  Focal slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Occasional right mid to posterior temporal sharp waves are noted

in the transition from wakefulness to drowsiness



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


A brief burst of FIRDA was noted at the end of hyperventilation




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Produces an increase in amplitude of the

background




Photic Stimulation: In asymmetric driving response was


elicited, more marked in the region with a craniotomy



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION: Abnormal due to the following:


#1 right temporal focal slowing

#2 infrequent right mid to posterior temporal sharp waves,


clearly defined despite the breach rhythm

#3 occasional bursts of generalized slowing

#4 some bilateral background slowing and disorganization




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

The generalized features described above may be associated with


this patient's metabolic features including impaired renal

function.  The focal features and focal sharp waves in the region


of her previous  epilepsy surgery
