HISTORY: 55 y.o. FEMALE WITH PMHX OF RIGHT CRANIOTOMY AND HEMISPHERECTOMY FOR RASMUSSEN'S WITH  CC OF MULTIPLE SZS OVERNIGHT     evaluation of paroxysmal events.  MEDICATIONS: No current facility-administered medications for this visit.  No current outpatient prescriptions on file. Facility-Administered Medications Ordered in Other Visits: sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (BACTRIM DS) 800-160 mg per tablet 1 tablet PHENobarbital elixir 130 mg 32.5 mL acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg calcium carbonate (OS-CAL) tablet 625 mg docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg lactulose (CHRONULAC) solution 20 g lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) tablet 300 mg lubiprostone (AMITIZA) capsule 24 mcg multivitamin (THERA) tablet 1 tablet white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 200 mg senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/15/2016,08:48AM - 11/16/2016, 08:00)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies seen only over the left hemisphere.  There is diffuse right hemisphere attenuation.   Sleep was seen as a state change with some of the features of sleep.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Occasional (1/hour to <1min) left anterior temporal sharp waves are seen.  EVENTS: Multiple events from sleep occur. Sometimes with stimulation suddenly opens her eyes and may lift her right or left arm in a flexed and tonic posture as she turns her head to the left sometimes more aggressively than others. She also moans. She then after 5-20 seconds suddenly stops and goes back to sleep. She was tested during an event and seemed to be responsive.   EKG: A single lead captured 66bpm  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: 1. Episodes of tonic posturing likely deep partial seizure 2. Left anterior temporal sharp waves 3. Right hemisphere attenuation 4. Diffuse slow waves   --------------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (11/16/2016, 08:00AM - 11/17/2016, 08:00AM)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies seen only over the left hemisphere.  There is diffuse right hemisphere attenuation.   Sleep was seen as a state change with some of the features of sleep.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Occasional (1/hour to <1min) left anterior temporal sharp waves are seen.  EVENTS: Events from sleep occur in the early morning and afternoon but stop after and no more are seen.   Description: Sometimes with stimulation suddenly opens her eyes and may lift her right or left arm in a flexed and tonic posture as she turns her head to the left sometimes more aggressively than others. She also moans. She then after 5-20 seconds suddenly stops and goes back to sleep. She was tested after an event and was responsive.   EKG: A single lead captured 66bpm  DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: 1. Episodes of tonic posturing likely deep onset focus partial seizure, now stopped. 2. Left anterior temporal sharp waves 3. Right hemisphere attenuation 4. Diffuse slow waves    --------------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (11/17/2016, 08:00AM - 11/18/2016,11:00AM )  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies seen only over the left hemisphere.  There is diffuse right hemisphere attenuation.  Sleep was seen as a state change with some of the features of sleep.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Occasional (1/hour to <1min) left anterior temporal sharp waves are seen.  EVENTS: None  EKG: A single lead captured 66 bpm  DAY 3 IMPRESSION  This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Left anterior temporal sharp waves 2. Right hemisphere attenuation 3. Diffuse slow waves  CLINICAL CORRELATION The episodes concerning for focal deep seizures stopped. However, the left anterior temporal sharp waves are suggestive of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. In addition the right hemisphere attenuation and slowing is consistent with the known right hemispherectomy. Lastly, the diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
