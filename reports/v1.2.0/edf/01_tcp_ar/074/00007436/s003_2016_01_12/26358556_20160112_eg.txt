HISTORY:

41 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy and

pachygyria as well as HTN and reported prior hydrocephalus vs


encephalitis, referred for routine EEG for characterization of

seizures.

daily.

daily.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha, theta and beta frequencies,

with a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR)


that reaches 9 Hz. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of

frequency and amplitude is present.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.


Mild generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing

2. Mild tachycardia



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of mild diffuse cerebral

dysfunction.


Mild tachycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.
