HISTORY:

50 y.o. male with a history of traumatic brain injury, chronic encephalopathy,
recently seen in the emergency room for breakthrough seizure,  referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (BACTRIM DS) 800-160 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2
times daily for 5 days.

Food Supplement, Lactose-Free (ENSURE) Liquid, 1 can with meals twice daily


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  The patient has a craniotomy defect
and a plate in his head




EEG BACKGROUND:





The patient is relatively drowsy throughout.  In maximal wakefulness,the background is slow and
disorganized, with a mixed theta/alpha pattern. There is focal slowing on the right with R>L delta.
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in delta on the right.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.



EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE: A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Slowing and disorganization with R>L focal slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are frequently found in association with bi-hemispheric
injury, more marked on the right.
