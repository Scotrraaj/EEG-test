HISTORY:

36  YR OLD FEMALE WITH H/O OF CEREBRAL

PALSY AND AUTISM. SHE ALSO HAS A DIAGNOSIS OF EPILEPSY AND HAS


SEIZURES EVERDAY AS PER HER MOTHER WITH HEAD MOVEMENT AND CRYING

OUT. 56 CM HEAD




MEDICATIONS:

OLANZAPINE,ZONISAMIDE,ZIPASIDONE,BACTRIM



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized a diffuse disorganized


polymorphic delta and theta with intermixed diffuse excessive

beta. The posterior dominant rhythm reaches at 6-7 Hz.




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare symmetric 4.5Hz generalized spike and wave discharges are

seen with a frontal predominance and bursts lasting one


second. No clear clinical correlate was seen.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Fast generalized spike and wave


2. Diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of generalized


epilepsy. In addition the diffuse slowing is indicative of

diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is non-specific with regards

to etiology.
