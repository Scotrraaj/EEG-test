SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to continuous movement artifact. and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized mixture of alpha and
beta frequencies, 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) at best. The normal anterior-to-posterior
gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



Excessive 5-7 Hz discharges are seen in wakefulness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Two shost bursts of symmetric frontal predominant generalized spike at 3.0hz are seen.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:




There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Frontal predominant generalzed spike and wave at 3 Hz

2. Mild diffuse slow waves and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy limited quality routine EEG due to generalized spike and
wave which may be seen in generalized epilepsy. In addition there is mid to moderate diffuse
background slowing and disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
