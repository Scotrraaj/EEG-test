HISTORY:

She is a 40 yo woman with intractable localization related


epilepsy here for presurgical evaluation.


Seizure description:


Type 1: Aura: Left eye twitching, whole body begins to tremble.

Her eyes then roll back and she losses consciousness, bites her

tongue and exhibits jerking of all four limbs. The seizure can


lasts about 5-10 minutes but she may have 2-3 episodes in a row.

After the seizure she is irritable has slurred speech intensity

confused/disoriented for about 15 minutes. Her current frequency


is weekly. They also occur from sleep.





AED's:


Depakote ER

Topamax



Previous AED's: Depakote (not for seizures). Stopped tegretol.


Risk Factors: No difficulties with birth or premature delivery,


no developmental delay, no febrile seizures, Positive family

history in her mother after head trauma and daughter at 11, no


CNS infections


Headaches:

Still In the left temporal region but can move around with an


pulsating pressure intensity with an intensity of 10/10.

Aggravated by her menses, photophobia, osmophobia, phonophobia


and nausea. They last 1 hour occurring 3-4 times a week. No

improvement with Depakote.


Daily excedrin and tylenol





EEG's:

7/20/12: Rhythmic background slowing, left temporal sharp waves

03/12/13: Mild diffuse slowing and left temporal slowing.



Imaging:

MRI


06/30/2014:

Impression: No findings of mesial temporal sclerosis or other

etiology

for epilepsy.



MRI 04/05/2004:


Impression:

Essentially unremarkable MRI examination of the brain.


Paranasal sinus disease as described above



MRA 04/05/2004:

Impression:


No evidence of aneurysm. Unremarkable MRA of the

circle-of-Willis.





Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Recording of seizures for

presurgical evaluation.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more

of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or


clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and

morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and


determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left

untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual

mortality rate.

- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient


number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are

reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures


and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus;

- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures

and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient

safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these

medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses


to document patientÂ’s exam

(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG

monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of


monitoring.  The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG

monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were


placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20

international electrode system.  Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9,


T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.

Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances


were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was

recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored

to computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently

reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.




Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and


computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG

activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8

hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A

neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.


The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a

registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and


testing.  During times when a technician was not available, EEG

recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and

nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.



The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program

(trademark named


time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.

Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were

reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and

detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external


hard drive media.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

Topamax 100 mg q12h

VPA 500 mg in AM, 1000 mg qhs



SEDATION: None



DAY 1 (3/21/2016, 10:58 - 3/22/2016, 06:00)



AEDs 3/21:

VPA 500 mg in AM, 500 mg in PM


TOP 100 mg q12h



BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous, symmetric, fairly-organized,

and consists predominantly of alpha with admixed beta.



Posterior dominant rhythm was present at 9 Hz.



The background is reactive, variable.


There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



In drowsiness there is fragmentation of the posterior dominant


rhythm, with intrusions of sharply contoured theta and

occasionally delta.


Sleep was characterized by symmetric sleep spindles and


K-complexes.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Rare left anterior temporal (F7/T1 max) spike and wave


discharges,

activated by sleep


2. A single right temporal (T4>F8 max) sharp and wave discharge,

in sleep


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.





EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or


detected.



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal video EEG due to:


1. Suboptimal organization

2. Rare left anterior temporal (F7/T1 max) spike and wave

discharges,

activated by sleep


3. A single right temporal (T4>F8 max) sharp and wave discharge,

in sleep



These findings indicate the presence of left anterior temporal >

right temporal epileptogenic discharges.




-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 2 (3/22/2016, 06:00 - 3/23/2016, 8AM)



AEDs 3/22:


VPA 500 mg in AM, 0 mg in PM

TOP 100 mg q12h


INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:


The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reaches

9 Hz.  Suboptimal organization persists.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured..



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Occasional left anterior temporal (F7/T1 max) spike and wave

discharges, activated by sleep


2. Rare right temporal (T4>F8 max) sharp and wave discharge, in

sleep



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



SEIZURES/EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in The 90s-100s



DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Similar to day 1.

Mild tachycardia noted.


These findings indicate the presence of left anterior temporal >


right temporal epileptogenic discharges.
