SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:


During maximal arousal the background consists of 9 Hz alpha

activity posteriorly with expected AP gradient.  For the majority


of the recording, the background consists of diffuse

moderate-to-high amplitude monomorphic 5.5-6.5 Hz theta activity

admixed with occasional polymorphic delta activity.



No clear architecture of drowsiness is captured.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and further increases background


slowing.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional


abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A regular heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

Diffuse slowing - mild

No sleep stage II


No epileptiform discharges



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and

disorganization.



These findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral

dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.



The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not


rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
