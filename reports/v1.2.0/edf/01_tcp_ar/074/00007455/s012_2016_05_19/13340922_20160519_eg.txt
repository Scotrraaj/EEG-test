HISTORY:

50 y.o. female with a history of seizures and change in mental status referred for EEG
for characterization of seizures.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with
T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and
included a single channel of EKG.





DAY 1 (05/18/16, 12:36AM - 05/19/2016, 06:00)


BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous, asymmetric, with moderate disorganization  and consists
predominantly of alpha and theta activity.



Posterior dominant rhythm was present and more evident over the right hemisphere reaching 8-9Hz.



The background is reactive, and variable.


There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was not captured.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare (<1hour) left frontal spike and wave complexes lasting 1-3 seconds, approximately 4-5 Hz,
maximal at F7, with field spread to the central regions and to the right frontal region. There is no
obvious clinical correlate to this activity.











EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected. There were at times, long runs of
higher amplitude slowing and admixted spike-and-wave discharges over the left, without clinical
correlate. These did not organize into electrographic seizures and could have been related to
arousal or state changes.




EKG: A single lead captured sinus rhythm.



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:


Focal left hemisphere slowing and left frontal spike and wave discharges.


These findings are suggestive of a structural lesion with epileptogenic potential in the left frontal
region.


-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 2 (05/19/16, 06:00 - 5/20/2016, 06:00)


BACKGROUND: No change



GENERALIZED SLOWING: None



FOCAL SLOWING: No change


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Occasional (1/hour to <1min) left frontal spike and wave
discharges lasting 1-3 seconds, approximately 4-5 Hz, maximal at F7 with field spread to the central
regions and to the right frontal region. This could also represent secondary bisynchrony. There is no
obvious clinical correlate to this activity.




EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured sinus rhythm.






DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

Focal left hemisphere slowing and left frontal spike and wave discharges.



These findings are suggestive of a structural lesion with epileptogenic potential in the left frontal
region.
