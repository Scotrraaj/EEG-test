HISTORY:

75 y.o. female with a history of syncope, prior stroke referred for routine EEG for
evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

Unknown, asa, plavix, no AED




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of generalized slowing, with mix of rhythmic
6-7 hz theta, scant alpha. AP gradient is not present. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity more on left
than right.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements and diffuse background slowing are seen. FIRDA was
noted. Some excess frontal beta noted.



Sleep is not sustained



Moderate generalized slowing is present.

Shifting focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none






EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm, irregular, is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Generalized background slowing

2. Shifting delta left greater than right



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with encephalopathy. Shifting focal features can
be correlated with imaging.
