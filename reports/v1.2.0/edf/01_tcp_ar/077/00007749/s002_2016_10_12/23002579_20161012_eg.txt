SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10-10.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:





Several synchronous low amplitude spikes with aftergoing slow waves are captured over the bilateral
centrotemporal region, Right>left.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


none


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with poor cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 48-56 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep EEG due to:

1. Several synchronous centrotemporal epileptiform discharges, right>left.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding indicates a potentially epileptogenic focus over the bilateral centrotemporal region.
