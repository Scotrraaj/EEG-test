HISTORY:

69 y.o. female with a history of  Epilepsy, recently more confused after 2 seizures
this past weekend.  Multiple medical problems, referred for routine EEG for management of seizure
exacerbation.




MEDICATIONS:

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a reasonably symmetric mixture of alpha
and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7-8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The
normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is a small amount
of theta





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep included brief spindles.


Intermittent generalized slowing is present.


Infrequent L>R temporal focal slowing is present. Isolated theta or delta in drowsiness only


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:One low voltage T1 sharp wave



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Photic Stimulation: scant driving



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Mild background slowing and disorganization


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings differ from the 6/29/2016 EEG which did not identify generalized slowing. Either post
ictal state or a metabolic process may contribute to this.  This study did not identify significant
epileptiform features.
