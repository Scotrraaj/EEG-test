History:	69 year old woman with a history of seizures.
Medications:	GABAPENTIN, KEPPRA,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal 
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric 
Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region 
during wakefulness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, left temporal, anterior
	Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 1 hour EEG due to occasional mild focal slowing in the 
left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is 
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.
