HISTORY:

53 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy, currently seizure-free referred for routine
EEG for characterization of seizures.


He had childhood brain surgery with evacuation of a clot.  2 years ago he developed epilepsy but
has been seizure free for one year.  History of hypertension, renal disease, alcohol abuse

TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  This patient was exceptionally
drowsy. P3 and P4 skull defects were noted.




EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by generous, diffuse beta.  There is
scant, 9 Hz alpha noted infrequently present bilaterally.  In apparent wakefulness, there are rare
bursts of shifting slowing.During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and
fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  The beta
activity becomes a bit more remarkable and the bursts of slowing were noted a bit more prominently
Sleep is characterized by abundant spindles and POSTS as well as vertex waves




No significant generalized slowing is present.

Infrequent, shifting focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: there was a single T2 sharp wave, convergent with an EOM.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Sharply contoured activity- sharply contoured rhythmic slowing is noted sometimes from the left
without definitive sharp wave or spike



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Scant driving was noted


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Bursts of sharply contoured shifting theta, seen from the right or left temporal region.


2. Prominent diffuse beta.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

The beta is a nonspecific finding but may be correlated with the use of sedative hypnotic medication
such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  This shifting temporal slowing A be correlated with this
patient's imaging.  Only a single sharp wave was noted.
