HISTORY:

40 y.o. male with a history of   Epilepsy, last admitted to TUH Neurology service
in Sep 2011 for generalized tonic clonic seizure. The MRI Brain was concerning for possible
heterotropia. Patient reports that he had no breakthrough seizures as long as he was on Kepprar,
eferred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events and characterization of seizures.



He has a history of drug dependence and HIV

MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) 300 mg tablet, TK 1 T PO  QHS

ISENTRESS 400 mg tablet,


NORVIR 100 mg Tablet,

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 250 mg tablet, Take 250 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

diazePAM (VALIUM) 2 mg tablet, Take 2 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for Anxiety.


CLONAZEPAM (KLONOPIN PO), Take  by mouth.

methadone (DOLOPHINE) 10 mg/mL oral solution, Take  by mouth every 4 hours as needed for Pain.



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system  with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
theta alpha and beta frequencies, with scant symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
There is excess theta noted, particularly in the posterior regions.  There is prominent frontal alpha
activity


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  There is  generous drowsiness Sleep is
not sustained.


Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Photic Stimulation:

Despite artifact, there was a driving response


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild excess theta



CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific.  This patient's medications or clinical
conditions might contribute to the theta described above.  This particular EEG did not identify
epileptiform activity
