SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


Most of the study consists of drowsiness and sleep. During brief periods of wakefulness, the waking
background consists of fairly organized alpha and theta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7
Hz posterior dominant dominant rhythm. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is present but suboptimal.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.


No definite focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Occasional (1/hour to <1min) right temporal (T4 max) spike-wave, occasionally occurring in runs of
1 Hz <5 sec (periodic lateralized discharges, LPDs), and broadly distributed over the right temporal
chain


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Occasional right temporal (T4 max) spike-wave, occasionally occurring in runs of 1 Hz <5 sec
(periodic lateralized discharges, LPDs)



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of right temporal highly epileptogenic discharges superimposed
on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, the latter which may at least in part be associated with an
excessively drowsy state.
