HISTORY:

75 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy, R parietooccipital CVA, presenting with
increase in seizure frequency, referred for routine EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.



MEDICATIONS: CARBAMAZEPINE, MS-CONTIN MOPHINE, LORAZEPAM, FOSPHENYTOIN



SEDATION: as above



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The record consists entirely of sleep.  During a very brief nonsustained period of wakefulness, the
background consists of fragments of a posterior dominant rhythm with fair organization.






Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


There is occasional right central polymorphic slowing.



Mild generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) right fronto-central (Fp1/Fp2 and C4 max) sharp waves with a broad field


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Occasional right central polymorphic slowing

3. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) right fronto-central (Fp1/Fp2 and C4 max) sharp waves with a broad
field



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of right fronto-central epileptogenic potentials superimposed on
right central cerebral dysfunction and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, the latter of which may at
least in part be associated with an excessively drowsy state.
