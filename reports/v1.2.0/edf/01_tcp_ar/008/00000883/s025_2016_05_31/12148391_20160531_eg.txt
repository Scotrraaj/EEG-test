HISTORY: 75 y.o. female with a history of refractory epilepsy, recurrent status epilepticus, now presents with increase in seizure frequency in the context of pelvic abscess and pelvic cancer.     MEDICATIONS: Tegretol Phenobarbital  SEDATION: Ativan  TECHNIQUE: Continuous video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. Seizure and spike detection software was used. The patient was in the NICU with EEG tech and RN supervision.    DAY 1 (05/31/2016 10:30 am, - 6/1/2016, 06:15 AM)  BACKGROUND:  The patient had been very agitated at EEG hook-up and received ativan.   The initial background is diffusely slow mixed frequency with bursts of frontal alpha and theta frequency activity.  Superimposed focal slowing can be seen from the right hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity of the right.  As the patient becomes more awake, the awake pattern is characterized primarily by more of a theta background.  The alpha rhythm remains disrupted on the right.  Over the course of this 24-hour section, the patient received increasing doses of phenobarbital.  This produces a more sedated sleep pattern with 11-14 Hz activity, particularly in the frontal regions.   PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  In addition to multiple electrographic seizures, described below, and there are intermittent, bifrontal sharp waves  EVENTS:  Multiple electrographic seizures were identified.  Initially, it was difficult to determine that clinical correlates for the seizures as the patient had been sedated.  In addition, this was a very ill patient. When the patient is awake and can interact during a seizure, it is clear that she is confused and agitated during the seizure.  When she is not having a seizure, she is able to look at the examiner and to follow some simple commands.  She seems to be neglectful of visual phenomenon in the left visual field during the seizures.  As the recording continues and the patient did receive some more doses of phenobarbital, clear clinical changes are more difficult to determine.  Ictal patterns: All seizures emanate from the right posterior temporal region.  There is some variability in the ictal pattern.  All began with rhythmic alpha or theta frequency activity.  Sometimes there is more of a right occipital periodic delta.  Typical seizure duration is 1:20-1:40 in duration.  Onset of some seizures was obscured by movement of the patient or clinical team.  Some examples include 11:44, 12:30, 1:18:30 14:13, 16:52. Seizures were slowing down by 22:44. Seizures have abated from 4 AM to 6:14 AM  EKG: A single lead captured   DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: Focal or Complex partial status epilepticus. With the use of higher doses of Phenobarbital clinical features are difficult to define. Seizures are decreasing, but patient continues to have several per hour at a minimum.  After the MRI and with additional doses of phenobarbital, seizures had stopped.   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (06/01/2016, 06:15 am - 6/2/2016, 06:15 am)   BACKGROUND: no change GENERALIZED SLOWING:  No change  Typical seizures occur mostly in clusters throughout the recording epoch.  Clusters occur from ~ 10 am to 10:22 am (4 seizures), 1:42 pm to ~2:06 PM (9 seizures), 3:32 pm to 3:57 pm (8 seizures), 8:16 pm to 8:51 pm (10 seizures), 10:05 pm to 1:06 pm (~ 60 seizures, occurring every 3-5 minutes - focal status epilepticus), 5:01 am till 6:15 am (~16 seizures - focal status epilepticus). Patient also has isolated seizures at ~6:11 pm and 6:36 pm and 4:59 am and 5:01 am.   EKG: A single EKG lead captured regular heart rate    DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Abnormal 24-hour continuous video EEG recording due to ongoing focal right posterior quadrant onset seizures that tend to occur in clusters.  At least 2 epochs of focal status epilepticus are captured.  There is structural epileptogenic focus over the right posterior quadrant.   These findings were conveyed to the primary team.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (06/02/2016, 06:15 am - 6/3/2016, 06:15 am) Medications: Phenobarbital, others  VERSED drip was initiated.  Clinical: intubated, poorly responsive. BACKGROUND: the interictal background is initially a mixture of alpha and theta with attenuation of faster frequency R posterior. After seizures stop at 3 PM on 6/3 there is more of a burst suppression or attenuating pattern bilaterally with frontal alpha, L>R.    GENERALIZED SLOWING: More remarkable after seizures stop.  FOCAL SLOWING: unchanged  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY bursts of frontal alpha  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare (<1hour) R occipital   EVENTS: repetitive R P4-O2 maximum seizures are noted in clusters 6 AM to 7:30 AM and again 1 PM to 3:30 PM, without clinical correlate. There is some variability in the ictal pattern.  All began with rhythmic alpha or theta frequency activity.  Sometimes there is more of a right occipital periodic delta.   EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR of 78   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Titration of versed drip seems to have stopped the R occipital parietal seizures. However, the EEG pattern is a bit more suppressed. 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------- DAY 4 (06/03/2016, 06:15 am - 6/4/2016, 06:15 am) Medications: Phenobarbital, others  VERSED drip  Patient is intubated and poorly responsive BACKGROUND:  the interictal background is initially comprised of  frontal 9-10 alpha with attenuation of faster frequency R posterior. There is A subtle or intermittent suppression or attenuating pattern more prominent on the right.   GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change. See above PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Stimulation of the patient at 4 AM on 6-4 produces FIRDA  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured 80 BPM   DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION 1.

Overall background is improving. Patient is increasingly awake.   -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Electrographic and subtle clinical status epilepticus, responsive to Midazolam. The ictal pattern is similar to her prior bouts of status epilepticus 2. Initially sedated pattern, with gradual return of alpha rhythm L>R 3.
