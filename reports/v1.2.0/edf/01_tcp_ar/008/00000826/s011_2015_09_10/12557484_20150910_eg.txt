EEG REPORT



 











MEDICATIONS: Keppra on hold, Seroquel, Klonopin, and many others.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG. No clinical events were noted. There were 2 practice push buttons.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. In drowsiness, shifting slowing is noted with occasional attenuation and a breach rhythm noted on the right in sleep. Limited stage II sleep was noted, and throughout much of the night the patient is in the lighter stages of sleep.
Epileptiform detections: None. Epileptiform seizures: None. Push buttons: Practice PB only
Heart rate: 72 8PM. IMPRESSION:
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This third day of continuous video EEG monitoring is remarkable for:
	•	No epileptiform discharges.
	•	No clinical seizures.
	•	Occasional shifting slowing noted primarily in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with previous craniotomy and risk for seizures, EEG monitoring will continue.
