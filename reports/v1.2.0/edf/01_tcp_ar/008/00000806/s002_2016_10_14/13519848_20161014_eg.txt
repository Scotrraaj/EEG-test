HISTORY:

64 y.o. female with a history of  multiple CVA (R MCA, Left Cerebellar), Type II
DM, HTN, HLD, CAD, neurogenic bladder and mixed urinary incontinence, previous endometrial Ca,
Right eye blindness, GERD who presents was found unresponsive in bed yesterday by a neighbour
who had been checking on her. She is a long tern SNF resident. She had been non verbal x 4 days,
and bed bound for 1 week prior to admission. Referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.




MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

[START ON 10/15/2016] meropenem (MERREM) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 80 mg


aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg

clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg


vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 500 mL IVPB




TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.




DAY 1 (- 10/14/2016, 13:00)

BACKGROUND:


The  background is  continuous,  Symmetric, markedly slow with featureless delta and slow theta. As
the record continues, there is a richer theta pattern


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Infrequent triphasic waves, seen later in the PM


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Sporadic frontal blunted GPEDS were seen, a bit more remarkable on
the left as the evening progresses, never evolving



EVENTS: None



EKG: A single lead captured HR 126 BPM



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

Markedly slow background


Occasional frontal GPED transients.

Occasional triphasic waves

Overall, background improving over time (response to treatment of acute illness, c/w treatment of
toxic metabolic encephalopathy)


No seizures were identified.
