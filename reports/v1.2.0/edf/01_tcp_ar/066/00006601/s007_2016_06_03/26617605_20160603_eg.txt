 L-NORGEST-ETH ESTR/ETHIN ESTRA (LOSEASONIQUE PO) Take by mouth. 1 tablet daily




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with
T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and
included a single channel of EKG , verbal stimulation.



CLINICAL SUMMARY OF LTM:


DAY 1: Had one typical generalized tonic clonic seizure.

DAY 2: Had no clinical events overnight. Generalized paroxysmal fast activity frequently during sleep.

DAY 3: No seizure activity


____________________________

DAY 1, June 3rd to 4th, 2016:

EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
theta/delta and slow alpha frequencies, with at times a 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).


The background is reactive and variable.

There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency including frontal slow wave spike.



Sleep was characterized by abnormal sleep transients with frequent delta waves, with synchronous
and symmetric vertex waves. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Sharply contoured activity

FIRDA



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s)


Frequent GPFA noted in sleep.

Frontally predominant slow wave activity.

Bursts of frontal spike and slow waves not lasting more than 3 seconds.



EVENTS:

10 PM: One typical generalized tonic clonic seizure.


Behavior:



Patient was awake with slow alpha waves on EEG. Patient was in bed and had tonic clonic rhythmic
and synchronous jerking of bilateral arms and legs. Due to the jerking movements the sheet came on
her face and she continued to have jerking movements. The seizure lasted for 44 seconds and
stopped abruptly. There was diffuse postictal slowing afterwards.



Ictal pattern:

There is waves of frontal delta followed by generalized background of muscle artifact compatible
with tonic clonic seizure followed by prolonged background slowing.



1:06 AM: Subclinical seizures


Behavior: Sleeping. Subclinical seizure lasting less than 12 seconds

Ictal pattern: Diffusely, synchronous slow delta wave pattern.



EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate of 72 bpm.


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

1. Generalized tonic clonic seizure noted clinically which was correlated with epileptiform EEG
changes followed by post ictal slowing.


2. Frontal slow spike and wave.

3. Focal frontal slowing and poorly organized symmetric mixture of theta/delta and slow alpha
frequencies


4. Frequent GPFA noted in sleep



_____________________________

DAY 2, June 4th to 5th, 2016:


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a somewhat better organized symmetric
mixture of theta/delta and alpha frequencies, with generally 8-9Hz ad occasionally 10 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR).


The background is reactive and variable.


There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency including frontal slow wave spike.


Sleep was characterized by abnormal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
spindles and K-complexes.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Sharply contoured activity




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Bursts of diffuse, frontally predominant, slow spike and waves not lasting more than 3 seconds. Some
are preceded by polyspikes or GPFA.


Slow spike and wave activity persistent in deep sleep and is preceeded by right frontal fast activity.


Bursts of central and frontal theta activity


EVENTS:


1:15 PM: A 25 second diffuse burst epileptiform slow spike wave activity was noted with no clinical
correlation. There was no post ictal slowing.

1:34 PM: A 7 second episode, same as above


3:34 PM: A 36 second difuse burst epileptiform slow spike activity with no clinical correlation. This
was followed by post ictal slowing.


EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate of 84 bpm.


DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

1. Bursts of diffuse, frontally predominant, slow spike and waves not lasting more than 3 seconds

2. Frontal slow spike and wave.


3. GPFA noted in sleep

DAY 3, June 5th to 6th, 2016 (9am):

EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
theta/delta and slow alpha frequencies, with at times a 8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The background is reactive and variable.


There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency including frontal slow wave spike.


Sleep was not captured.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Sharply contoured activity



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Less epileptiform activity on day 3.


Frontally predominant slow wave activity.



Bursts of frontal spike and slow waves not lasting more than 3 seconds.



EVENTS:

6:43 AM: A 6 second diffuse burst epileptiform slow spike wave activity was noted with no clinical
correlation. There was no post ictal slowing.



EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate of 78 bpm.



DAY 3 IMPRESSION & FINAL IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:


1. Generalized tonic clonic seizure noted clinically which was correlated with epileptiform EEG
changes followed by post ictal slowing.

2. Frontal slow spike and wave.


3. Focal frontal slowing and poorly organized symmetric mixture of theta/delta and slow alpha
frequencies


4. GPFA noted in sleep

5. Multiple bursts of diffuse, frontally predominant, slow spike and waves not lasting more than 40
seconds without clear clinical correlate
