HISTORY:

29 y.o. WOMAN WITH A HX OF EPILEPSY. LAST SZ WAS YESTERDAY
MORNING AROUND 4AM PER FATHER LASTING ONLY SECONDS. LAST MONTH AND A HALF
THE SZ HAVE BECOME MORE FREQUENT. PER FATHER PT NEVER HAD ANY SZ IN THE
MORNING, NOW SHE IS.



DOWN'S SYNDROME



MEDICATIONS: FYCOMPA, BANZEL, LAMOTRIGINE




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to movement and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
theta/delta and alpha frequencies, with at times a 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The
anterior-to-posterior gradient can be seen at times but the background is mainly disorganized.
Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.





Sleep is not captured


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



1. Generalized slow waves, mild to moderate

2. Left mid-temporal focal slow


3. Excess beta






CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake only routine limited EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the left
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific. In addition there is mild to moderate diffuse background slowing and disorganization.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
