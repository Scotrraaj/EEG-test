HISTORY:

47 y.o. male with a history of blackout spells referred for routine EEG for
evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

NAPROXEN PO, Take  by mouth. Indications: unknown dose - check with  patient

PHENYTOIN SODIUM EXTENDED (DILANTIN PO), Take  by mouth. Indications: unknown dose -
check with patient




TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a  Low voltage well organized symmetric
mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal  But few sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Low-voltage, scant driving was identified


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a low voltage normal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


CLINICAL CORRELATION: Normal EEG does not exclude diagnosis of epilepsy
