DATE OF STUDY: 09/16/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 49 y.o. female with a history of seizures, CVA, HIV, HTN, Bipolar disorder,
substance abuse. Her last seizure was 04/16 due to medication noncompliance. Referred for routine
EEG for characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.

divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 250 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 250 mg by mouth daily.

ATAZANAVIR SULFATE (REYATAZ PO), Take  by mouth.


abacavir-lamivudine (EPZICOM) 600-300 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is poorly organized and characterized by a diffusely slow theta rhythm, with a
6.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency
and amplitude is present. The wake record is obscured by near continuous muscle artifact,
particularly on the left side.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is briefly captured


Generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: produces scant driving at 9 Hz.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Diffusely slow theta rhythm with PDR 6.5 Hz.

2. Poorly organized pattern





CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are nonspecific but indicate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The medications or clinical
conditions could be a possible etiology of this EEG pattern. There is no evidence of epileptiform
activity but this does not rule out epilepsy.
