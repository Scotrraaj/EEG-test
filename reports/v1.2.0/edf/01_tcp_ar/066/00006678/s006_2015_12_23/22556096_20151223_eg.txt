Medications:	DILANTIN, KEPPRA, RISPERDONE, DIAZEPAM, LORAZEPAM, DIGOXIN, 
	MIRTAZAPINE,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, lethargic, photic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta 
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep
 architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the anterior 
temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is an asymmetry with 
attenuation seen also over the left hemisphere.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical
 or electrographic seizures were present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was 
Summary of Findings:
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left hemispheric, maximal anterior temporal 
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing and attenuation in the left 
hemisphere maximal in the anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal cortical 
structural lesion in this region.In addition ther is moderate  diffuse background slowing.  These 
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
