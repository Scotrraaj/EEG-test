DATE OF STUDY: 01/17/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only



HISTORY:

a 60 y.o. male with a history of Schizophrenia, presented with altered mental status
referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

nitrofurantoin (macrocrystal-monohydrate) (MACROBID) 100 mg capsule 100 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

aspirin EC tablet 81 mg

multivitamin (THERA) tablet 1 tablet


LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 1 mg


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:



A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Extensive periods of bilateral fluttering of eyes with accompanying EEG eye flutter artifact seen.


Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake-only routine EEG.

No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is a normal awake-only routine EEG.



A normal EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
