HISTORY:

32 y.o. female with a history of anaplastic oligodendroglioma, with MRI
Cystic encephalomalacia/gliosis is in the right paramedian frontal lobe, recent seizure (not on AEDS)
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily for 10 days.


temozolomide (TEMODAR) 250 mg capsule, TAKE 1 CAPSULE BY MOUTH ONCE DAILY FOR 5
DAYS, EVERY 28 DAYS. TAKE WITH A FULL GLASS OF WATER.

loperamide (IMODIUM A-D) 2 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth as needed for Diarrhea.


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 325 mg tablet, Take 650 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed.
Indications: Pain



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is
scant low voltage frontal 4 hz activity.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not sustained

No generalized slowing is present.


No major focal slowing is present.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:none



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces scan t
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.




EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:

1. Scant frontal theta in wakefulness



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with imaging. No epileptiform features
were identified. If needed, consider a sleep deprived EEG.
