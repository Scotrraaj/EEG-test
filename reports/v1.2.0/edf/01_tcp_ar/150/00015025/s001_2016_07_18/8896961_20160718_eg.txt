HISTORY:

36 y.o. female p/w episode of feeling "out of it" which is the last thing she
remembers before waking up on the ground.? durationtounge hurt afterwards,



MEDICATIONS:


No AEDs




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized mixture of alpha and
beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at best reaches
8 Hz. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Excessive
theta in wakefulness is seen.




Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Mild diffuse slow wave and disorganization

2. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
