History:	36 year old woman with a history of seizures.
	
	Hyperventilation is not perform since patient is having breathing difficulties.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, 
	drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal 
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric 
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Patient very rapidly transitions from wakefulness to stage 
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
	No epileptiform discharges
	Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute EEG, awake, and mostly asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges 
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Rapid transions from 
wakefulness to stage II sleep are suggestive of an excessively drowsy patient versus an underlying 
sleep disorder - please correlate clinically.
