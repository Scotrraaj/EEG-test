HISTORY:

50 y.o. male with a history of R MCA stroke and R craniotomy with seizures, referred
for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

baclofen (LIORESAL) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily as needed.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric.

The left hemisphere consists of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies,
with a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that reached 9 Hz. The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.


The right hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of more attenuated alpha, theta, and
delta. There is no definite posterior dominant rhythm.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.


There is continuous right hemispheric polymorphic slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Continuous right hemispheric polymorphic slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Attenuation of faster frequencies on the right



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of right hemispheric dysfunction and cortical injury, likely
structural in etiology.
