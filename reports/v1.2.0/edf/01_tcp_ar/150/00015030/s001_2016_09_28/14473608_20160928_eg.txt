HISTORY:

43 y.o. male with a history of apparent single seizure during sleep referred for
routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

MULTIVITAMINS WITH FLUORIDE (MULTIVITAMINS W/FLUORIDE PO), Take  by mouth.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The patient was poorly relaxed during the study. The waking background consists of a large amount
of generalized low voltage 20-30 Hz activity with superimposed muscle artifact and prominent EKG
artifact. A small amount of symmetric low voltage 11-12 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) was
seen, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
