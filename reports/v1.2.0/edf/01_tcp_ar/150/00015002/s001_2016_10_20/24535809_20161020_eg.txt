HISTORY:

31 y.o. female with a history of stroke 2 years ago, chronic left sided weakness, now
with episodes of loss of consciousness when she is under stress referred for routine EEG for evaluation
of paroxysmal events.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  There is a small amount of diffuse theta noted,
particularly in the frontocentral regions




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.

Sleep is not captured


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:    Photic Stimulation: Does elicit scant driving



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of  72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.






IMPRESSION: This is a very mildly abnormal routine EEG.

1. Excess theta


CLINICAL CORRELATION: The excess theta described above is a nonspecific finding but is common
in the context of polypharmacy as outlined above.  In regard to the history of stroke, there were no
focal features noted. There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.


This routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
