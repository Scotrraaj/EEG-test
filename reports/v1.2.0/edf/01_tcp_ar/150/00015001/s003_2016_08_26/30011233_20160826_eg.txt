HISTORY: 64 y.o. male with a history of recent respiratory arrest, followed by cardiac arrest.  Persistently comatose with normal CT  referred for EEG for treatment of status epilepticus.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg heparin 25,000 units (100 units/mL) in 0.45% sodium chloride 250 mL infusion (Premix) Depakote  SEDATION: versed to start TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.   DAY 1 (  8/26/2016, 11:30:00- 08/27/2016) Additional medicines: Versed, then Phenobarb BACKGROUND: The  background is continuous, fairly symmetric, very rhythmic, and consists of rhythmic mixed theta/delta with continuous bifrontal sharp waves and spikes/sharp slow wave discharges varying from 3-4.8Hz. There is a polyspike component to the activity. The background is variable. Over the first 24 hours patient is titrated to 14 mg Versed. This produces some blunting of the sharp waves, spikes.  There are occasional focal spikes, Frontal or temporal. There is an increase in theta  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Abundant (>1/10s) Continuous, frontal/bifrontal See above.  Infrequent focal spikes  EVENTS: No clinical events reported or detected. Pt unresponsive with intact CN functions  EKG: A single lead captured HR 92 BPM  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: Initial ongoing frontal spike wave- c/w a generalized status pattern or post anoxic pattern. There was some improvement with Midazolam at higher doses, suggesting that this pattern is epileptiform and potentially responsive to additional AED therapy.  Findings discussed with team.    -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (08/27/16 - 8/28/2016, 9PM:) Versed weaned on the afternoon of 8/28- then to be resumed low dose in the P< BACKGROUND: With the use of Versed/Phenobarbital the EEG transitions to a more rhythmic theta pattern and the sharps or spikes are blunted.   GENERALIZED SLOWING: transitions from theta to suppressed, featureless pattern as epileptiform features wane.   FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Rhythmic frontal delta  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Abundant (>1/10s) initial transition to lower amplitude frontal spikes Later slow periodic bifrontal sharp waves are noted  EVENTS: Despite artifact, on at least two occasions on the 28th there are prolonged runs of Generalized periodic complexes of 0.9 to1.45 Hz, which stand out from an otherwise increasingly suppressed background. These were seen at 6:21 AM, 6:40 AM, 4:40 PM and discernable during artifact at 9 PM. The later bursts are slower  EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 80-90 BPM  DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  This is a dynamic record which captures multiple patterns of severe CNS /anoxic insult. As Midazolam was withdrawn, the background became increasingly suppressed. The runs of Periodic activity later in this section suggest on going need for AED therapy.      -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (8/28/2016 - 8/289/2016 14:00) Medications include phenobarbital  VPA BACKGROUND: The overall background continues to deteriorate with longer periods that are slow and suppressed  GENERALIZED SLOWING: Continues to worsen  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Earlier in this at fact there are more periods with generalized periodic complexes, at times they'll occur in brief bursts but overtime these are disappearing   EVENTS: None  EKG: A single EKG lead captured 114 BPM   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION For this individual, with a severe anoxic encephalopathy, the pattern has changed over time to a more suppressed pain pattern.  Sustained seizures are no longer identified although post anoxic periodic complexes were seen
