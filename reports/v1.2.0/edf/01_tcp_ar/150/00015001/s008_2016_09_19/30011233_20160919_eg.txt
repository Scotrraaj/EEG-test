SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by generalized
suppression with some diffuse very low voltage delta activity and minimal theta with absence of the
expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.




There are generalized periodic discharges seen at 0.4-0.5Hz some with a more frontal perdominant
epileptiform morphology (GPEDs) and others with a more triphasic morphology. No clinical correlate
was noted on video.





Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

See above



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Generalized periodic discharges

2. Severe background slowing and suppresion



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal routine EEG due to generalized periodic discharges and severe diffuse
background slowing.  These findings suggestive of severe diffuse cortical dysfunction and irritability
and can be seen in the setting of diffuse hypoxic injury. No seizure activity was seen.
