DATE OF STUDY: 01/13/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 34 y.o. female with a history of posttraumatic convulsive seizures for 10
years, admission for spontaneous abortion, exhibiting shaking movements and muscle jerking,
referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


prenatal vitamin w/iron tablet

topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 150 mg

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) tablet 600 mg


famotidine (PEPCID) tablet 20 mg

ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg

doxycycline (VIBRA-TABS) tablet 200 mg


phenol (CHLORASEPTIC) 1.4 % spray 1 spray

ferrous sulfate tablet 325 mg

docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg




sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion






SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by symmetric and reactive low voltage 10-11 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Low amplitude
frontocentral beta activity is noted. A large amount of muscle artifact and occasional EKG artifact are
seen.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by attenuation of muscle artifact, increased generalized slowing, positive
occipital sharp transients of sleep along with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles
and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
