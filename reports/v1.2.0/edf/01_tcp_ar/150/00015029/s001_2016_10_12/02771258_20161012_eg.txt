HISTORY:

19 y.o. female with a history of 2 seizures in life.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:






The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Bursts of 3.5 to 4 Hz spike and wave, maximal frontal and seen mainly symmetrically on both sides.
The majority appear fragmented. The bursts last less than 2 seconds.


No clinical correlate seen with them.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. 3.5 to 4 Hz spike and wave, generalized


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to generalized epileptiform discharges, this
is consistent with the diagnosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.
