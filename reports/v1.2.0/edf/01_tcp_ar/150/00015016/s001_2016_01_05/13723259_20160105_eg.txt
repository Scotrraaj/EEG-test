HISTORY:

58 y.o. female with a history of a ruptured

aneurysm and CVA 8/2015, s/p crani (no bone flap on right), left


hemiplegia. She developed 4 new onset seizures on 12/15/2015

characterized by slumping to the right and shaking, referred for

routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA, BACLOFEN, GABAPENTIN, TRAZODONE,S EROQUEL,

LISINOPRIL, ATORVASTATIN, RANITIDINE, GLIPIZIDE



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric.


The left hemisphere is characterized by a mixture of alpha, beta,

and excess theta frequencies distributed in an anterior-posterior

gradient that is suboptimally organized. There is a posterior

dominant rhythm of 10 Hz.


The right hemisphere is characterized by continuous, higher

amplitude, at times sharply contoured polymorphic delta activity


best seen

in the posterior quadrant with occasional fragments of an

irregular posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz. The higher

amplitude, sharply contoured activity is suggestive of breach


rhythm.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.


Mild generalized slowing is present.

There is continuous right hemispheric, posterior quadrant


predominant, polymorphic slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces photic driving over the left


hemisphere.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Continuous right hemispheric (posterior quadrant predominant)

polymorphic slowing, with

poor photic driving response on the right

3. Right posterior quadrant breach rhythm



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of right hemispheric

(posterior quadrant predominant) dysfunction superimposed on mild

diffuse cerebral dysfunction. A right posterior quadrant breach

rhythm is consistent with the patient's prior history of


craniotomy.
