HISTORY: 58 y.o. male who is referred for EEG monitoring while undergoing aortic valve replacement with cardiopulmonary bypass, ascending aortic arch replacement, hemiarch replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting, transesophageal echocardiogram.  MEDICATIONS: No current facility-administered medications for this visit.  No current outpatient prescriptions on file. Facility-Administered Medications Ordered in Other Visits: lactated ringers infusion Epinephrine (ADRENALIN) 1 mg in dextrose 5 % in water 250 mL infusion midazolam (VERSED) 1 mg/mL injection fentanyl (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection lidocaine (pf) (cardiac) (XYLOCAINE) 100 mg/5 mL (2 %) injection etomidate (AMIDATE) injection rocuronium (ZEMURON) injection vasopressin (PITRESSIN) 100 Units in dextrose 5 % in water 250 mL infusion lactated ringers infusion electrolyte-R (NORMOSOL-R) infusion cefuroxime (ZINACEF) 1.5 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+ heparin (5000 units/mL) injection aminocaproic acid (AMICAR) injection methylprednisolone sodium succinate (PF) (Solu-MEDROL) injection magnesium sulfate 2 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB   SEDATION: induction meds: versed, lidocaine, etomidate  INTUBATION 7:47:26 AM  INCISION      8:41:17 AM HEPARIN 9:43:27 AM CARDIAC ARREST 10:02:01 AM    EEG ISOELECTRIC 10:42:31 AM  CIRCULATORY ARREST            11:05:57 AM  REWARMING        11:22:22 AM   TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in the operating room (OR) using the International 10-20 system and utilized a NicOne system.  This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  The recording begins with the patient awake in the OR and continues through sedation, hypothermia and then rewarming after completion of the procedure.  The study was monitored 1:1 with online remote neurophysiologist review.  A technician was available in the OR throughout the study.  The use of sedative medications was documented by the technician, in communication with the anesthetist, throughout the study.     EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of mostly low voltage fast frequencies. A well-formed posterior dominant rhythm is not captured.  Cooling began at 07:56.  With anesthesia and cooling the background progressively becomes slower, consisting of a disorganized mixture of theta and delta frequencies, and lower in amplitude. As the study progresses the background becomes intermittently attenuated, with complete suppression occurred at10:42AM. This was communicated to the team.   Rewarming began at 11:22:22.  The background slowly improved with faster frequencies in the theta/alpha frequency. At 1:26PM a diffuse slowing was noted and reported to the team. Anesthesia informed that insulin was given. Background remained slow at the end of the record.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS:  There are no clinical or electrographic events, other than as documented above, captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead at the beginning of the study.  IMPRESSION: This is an uneventful intraoperative EEG during cardiopulmonary surgery No seizures were seen.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an uneventful intraoperative 5 hour EEG during cardiopulmonary surgery with hypothermia. All changes were communicated to the primary team  as they occurred.
