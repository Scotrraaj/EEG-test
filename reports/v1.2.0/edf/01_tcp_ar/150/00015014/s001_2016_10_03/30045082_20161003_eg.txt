HISTORY:

64 y.o. MALE WITH CC OF CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS WITH GENERALIZED
SHAKING R/O NEW ONSET SEIZURE.  (PT GOING FOR CARDIAC CATH TODAY



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

magnesium oxide (MAG-OX) tablet 400 mg

carvedilol (COREG) tablet 12.5 mg


rosuvastatin (CRESTOR) tablet 20 mg

aspirin (BAYER) tablet 325 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

nitroGLYCERIN (NITROSTAT) SL tablet 0.4 mg




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Limited sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional small amplitude sharp waves are seen at F7/T3.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Occasional left anterior temporal small amplitude sharp waves

2. Occasional left mid-temporal focal slow waves





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to occasional sharp waves and focal slowing
in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a  focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability,
and  a

potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. No seizures were seen.
