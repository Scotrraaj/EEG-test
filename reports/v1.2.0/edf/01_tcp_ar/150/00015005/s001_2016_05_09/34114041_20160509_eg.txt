DATE OF STUDY: 05/09/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 22 y.o. 22 YR MAN CC OF CATATONIA LIKE SYMPTOMS.  DECLINED SINCE AGE
18 WORSE IN LAST YEAR, STOPPED COLLEGE (WAS HONOR STUDENT),  NON VERBAL
REQUIRES DIRECTION.  WAS HOSPILIZED AGE 18 FOR OCD




MEDICATIONS:

COGENTIN, HALDOL, ATIVAN, LUVOX



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record
due to patient movement and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Diffuse excess 5-7Hz activity and mild disorganization in wakefulness.



Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Excess theta in wakefulness

2. Excessive beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing and
mild disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates. No epileptiform activity was seen.
