HISTORY:

67 y.o. Woman with a previous right parietal infarct and new left temporal SAH.



MEDICATIONS:

NO AEDs



Vercuronium was given.



SEDATION:


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record
due to marked muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse
disorganized delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




Sleep is not captured.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) seen at T5-P3 at 1.4-1.6 Hz.

Independent periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) seen at F8-T4 at 1.3-1.6 Hz.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Independent PLEDs seen at right anterior temporal and left posterior quadrants.

2. Moderate to severe diffuse slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to independent PLEDs seen at right anterior
temporal and left posterior quadrants. These are indicative of irritable structural lesion in these
regions that is potentially epileptogenic. In addition there is moderate to severe diffuse background
slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No seizures were seen. This patient will go on to
long term EEG monitoring.
