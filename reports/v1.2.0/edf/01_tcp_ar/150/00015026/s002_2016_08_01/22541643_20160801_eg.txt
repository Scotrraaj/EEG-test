HISTORY: 67 y.o. female with a history of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage and fever, referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.  MEDICATIONS: Vimpat; Zosyn, vancomycin, insulin. Loaded with phenobarbital just prior to start of LTM study.  SEDATION: Received Vecuronium 6 mg during routine EEG performed just prior to this study  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (8/1/2016, 11:48 - 8/2/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, poorly organized, and consists predominantly of alpha, theta, and delta. There is no posterior dominant rhythm. Quieter states consist of relative attenuation of rhythms with increased prevalence of delta activity. Sleep transients are not captured.  There is moderate to severe generalized slowing.  Portions of the record become obscured (8/1 22:27 - 8/2 02:00) by diffuse muscle artifact, rendering interpretation suboptimal during these times.   PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Frequent right anterior temporal (F8 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 2. Frequent left posterior quadrant (T5/P3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes; these are frequently periodic at 0.5-1 Hz for runs <10 sec with underlying rhythmicity (LPD+R). These fluctuate up to 2 Hz for runs <2 min, but do not clearly evolve. 3. Occasional bilateral posterior quadrant sharp-and-wave complexes *Note that epileptiform activity is activated by the waking state (stimulus-induced discharges).  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 80s-90s.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and background disorganization 2. Frequent right anterior temporal (F8 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 3. Frequent left posterior quadrant (T5/P3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes; frequently periodic at 0.5-1 Hz for runs <10 sec with underlying rhythmicity (LPD+R) 4. Occasional bilateral posterior quadrant sharp-and-wave complexes  These findings are consistent with left posterior quadrant highly epileptogenic potentials, as well as epileptogenic potentials over the right anterior temporal and bilateral posterior quadrant regions, superimposed on moderate to severe diffuse slowing, which is etiologically nonspecific. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (8/2/2016, 06:00 - 8/3/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: No change Again, portions of background are obscured by muscle artifact on this day (i.e., 8/2 06:50-08:40), rendering interpretation during these times suboptimal. As this day progresses, background is obscured by diffuse muscle artifact for majority of recording. During quieter states, there are buzzes of fast activity over the bi-frontal leads that do not clearly evolve and may be artifactual in origin based on appearance.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Right anterior temporal sharp and wave complexes have become rare 2. Left posterior quadrant sharp-and-wave complexes remain frequent; somewhat less periodic  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 90s-110s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Limited, but abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and background disorganization 2. Rare right anterior temporal (F8 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 3. Frequent left posterior quadrant (T5/P3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes; occasionally periodic at 0.5-1 Hz for runs <10 sec with underlying rhythmicity (LPD+R) -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (8/3/2016, 06:00 - 8/3/2016, 10:42)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change from day 2  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate of 102   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change compared with day 2.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal, limited at times by artifact, long term video EEG due to:  1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and background disorganization 2. Frequent right anterior temporal (F8 max) sharp-and-wave complexes 3. Frequent left posterior quadrant (T5/P3 max) sharp-and-wave complexes; frequently periodic at 0.5-1 Hz for runs <10 sec with underlying rhythmicity (LPD+R) that fluctuate but do not clearly evolve 4. Occasional bilateral posterior quadrant sharp-and-wave complexes   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are consistent with left posterior quadrant highly epileptogenic potentials, as well as epileptogenic potentials over the right anterior temporal and bilateral posterior quadrant regions, superimposed on moderate to severe diffuse slowing, which is etiologically nonspecific. Over the course of the recording the right anterior temporal epileptogenic potentials decrease in prevalence. Left posterior quadrant epileptogenic potentials remain prevalent but are noted to be less periodic by the end of the recording.
