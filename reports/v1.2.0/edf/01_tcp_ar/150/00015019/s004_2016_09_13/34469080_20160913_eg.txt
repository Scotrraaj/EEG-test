HISTORY:

This is a 44 y.o. right handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: refractory epilepsy.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Medication adjustment and recording of seizures for
presurgical evaluation.




Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;




- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded
referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive.  Periods of interest
were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.




MEDICATIONS:

carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) 900 mg q12h


lacosamide (VIMPAT) 200 mg q12h


SEDATION: None



DAY 1 (9/12/2016, 10:03 - 9/13/2016, 06:00)



Meds:

9/12:

CBZ 900-900


LCS 200-100


BACKGROUND:



The waking background is continuous, symmetric, fairly-organized, and consists predominantly of
alpha with admixed excess theta. A posterior dominant rhythm of 7 Hz is present and symmetric.
There are occasional bursts of 2 Hz delta activity that is quasirhythmic, with superimposed fast
frequencies. Occasionally this delta activity is more prominent over the bilateral posterior quadrants.




Drowsiness consists of attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, with further
background slowing.



Sleep was characterized by rudimentary K complexes, often with embedded bilatera
spikes/polyspikes (dyshormia).




PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Frequent right posterior temporal (T6 max) spike/polyspike-wave - may occur synchronously with #3
and occasionally occur in runs of 1 Hz for <5 sec

2. Frequent right occipital (O2 max) spike/polyspike-wave. These occasionally occur in runs of 1-1.5
Hz for <5 sec


3. Frequent right parietal (P4 max) spike/polyspike/sharp-wave

4. Occasional sharp-wave activity seen broadly over right hemisphere (fronto-parietal field)


5. Occasional diffuse, bi-frontally prominent spike-wave. When viewed in a circle montage, these
frequently (but do not always) clearly phase reverse over the right frontal region (Fp2>F8/F4)


6. In sleep, occasional bursts of generalized paroxysmal fast activity for <5 sec


Epileptiform activity is activated by drowsiness.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patients interictal findings were significant for a 7 Hz posterior
dominant rhythm with suboptimal organization and frequent bursts of 2 Hz quasirhythmic delta
activity  with superimposed fast frequencies, occasionally more prominent over the bilateral posterior
quadrants. In addition, there were multiple subtypes of epileptiform discharges seen over the right
hemisphere:



1. Frequent right posterior temporal (T6 max) spike/polyspike-wave - may occur synchronously with #3
and occasionally occur in runs of 1 Hz for <5 sec


2. Frequent right occipital (O2 max) spike/polyspike-wave. These occasionally occur in runs of 1-1.5
Hz for <5 sec


3. Frequent right parietal (P4 max) spike/polyspike/sharp-wave

4. Occasional sharp-wave activity seen broadly over right hemisphere (fronto-parietal field)

5. Occasional diffuse, bi-frontally prominent spike-wave. When viewed in a circle montage, these
frequently (but do not always) clearly phase reverse over the right frontal region (Fp2>F8/F4)


6. In sleep, occasional bursts of generalized paroxysmal fast activity for <5 sec




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any definite electrographic seizures.









She did, however, push the event button multiple times for (1) dizziness, (2) hands/arms/body jerking,
(3) "feeling off/weird", (4) "blanking out". There was no clear electrographic ictal correlate to any of
these clinical symptoms.





SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. No seizures captured




EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:


1. No seizures captured; however, based on background and interictal findings, a symptomatic
epilepsy is suspected






CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video EEG.
This was an elective EMU monitoring session for medication adjustment and recording of seizures for
presurgical evaluation.




The patients interictal findings were significant for a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with suboptimal
organization and frequent bursts of 2 Hz quasirhythmic delta activity with superimposed fast
frequencies, occasionally more prominent over the bilateral posterior quadrants. In addition, there
were multiple subtypes of epileptiform discharges seen over the right hemisphere.




Multiple clinical episodes were captured, but none were associated with clear electrographic seizure
activity.



During this admission, she was tapered off Vimpat and started on Zonegran. Her Tegretol was
continued.



We recommend that she obtain a 3T MRI of the brain and undergo a neuropsychological evaluation.
