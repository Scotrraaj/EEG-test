HISTORY:

44 y.o. female with a history of refractory epilepsy referred for routine EEG for
recording of seizures for presurgical evaluation.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) tablet 900 mg


lacosamide (VIMPAT) tablet 100 mg

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.









EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is markedly abnormal. The record opens with a
medium to high amplitude pattern, chaotic with semi-arrhythmic theta and delta. Superimposed in
this background are multifocal sharp waves and spikes including  epileptiform discharges at T6, right
hemispheric right frontal, more so than focal left spikes



This pattern alternates with a medium amplitude alpha theta pattern with scant posterior dominant
rhythm of 7 Hz.


Generalized slowing is present.

Intermittent R focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Multifocal spikes, but primarily R hemispheric, R frontal or R central sharp waves or spikes.

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Bursts of generalized, chaotic, often posterior predominant delta/theta


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: accentuates irregular delta, particularly R hemisphere.



Photic Stimulation: does elicit a driving response.

EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A  single EKG lead.- n/a



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Slow, disorganized pattern

2. Intermittent R focal slowing

3. Multifocal spikes R>L



CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to a prior study, though less epileptiform
activity was seen today
