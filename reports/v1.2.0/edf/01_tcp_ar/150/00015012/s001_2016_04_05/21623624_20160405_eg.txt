HISTORY:

40 y.o. WOMAN PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P RT

THALAMIC STROKE 7/2014. NOW WITH ONSET 9/2014 OF UNEXPLAINED


FALLS OUT OF BED WHILE SLEEP. EEG TO R/O SZ. LAST EVENT 2/2016


MEDICATIONS:


No AEDs


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and


photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.

Diffuse excess theta is seen in wakefulness at times.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm with a wide QRS complex is captured on a

single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


derate

1. Excess theta in wakefulness


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to mild

diffuse background slowing.  These findings are etiologically


nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

Please note the wide QRS on single lead EKG.
