MEDICATIONS:



LORAZEPAM, KEPPRA, PROTONIX


SEDATION: Versed and propofol gtt



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a




NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due to

muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG and photic


stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence

disorganized mixture of delta/theta frequencies, with an absent

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior


gradient of frequency and amplitude is absent. Some intermixed

diffuse beta is seen at times.



At the beginning of the record there is a diffuse muscle artifact

that appears at 2Hz diffusely with a slight predominance over the

left hemisphere. It is not clear that there is an EEG correlate


to the muscle artifact. At one point the artifact is only seen on

the left hemisphere and no clear EEG correlate is seen on the


right. This muscle artifact is consistent with the twitching

described by the team but it is not well seen on the video.


Minutes later the artifact stops and diffuse, frontally maximal


sharp waves with triphasic morphology are seen throughout the

recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior


phase lag.


Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



HEART RATE: A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG

lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Myoclonus with no clear cortical correlate

2. Diffuse slowing

3. Triphasic waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal EEG due to subcortical myoclonus,  frequent


frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe diffuse background

slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse

encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but

suggestive of a metabolic origin.
