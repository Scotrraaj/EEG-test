HISTORY:

53 y.o. FEMALE PRESENTS FOR FOLLOW UP EEG.

ADMITTED ON 2/12/16 WITH ALTERED MENTAL STATUS



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The background reveals diffuse attenuation, with no normal

anterior to posterior gradient or organization.



There are diffuse periodic epileptiform discharges (PED's) that


appear to be posterior predominant and at times have a triphasic

morphology.


They occur at 0.5 Hz and when the patient is stimulated they


appear to occur at 1.0 Hz.



They do not appear to evolve.


Clinically the patient appears to exhibit shoulder twitching that

correlates with above PED's consistent with cortical myoclonus.



Sleep is not captured



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 94 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



1. PEDs

2. Myoclonus

3. Severe diffuse attenuation



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal EEG due to due to periodic discharges and


severe diffuse attenuation. This is indicative of severe diffuse

cerebral dysfunction and irritability. This are non-specific can


be seen in severe metabolic disturbances, post-hypoxic and rare

neurodegenerative diseases. The background when compared to


previous EEG has worsened becoming more attenuated which may be

indicative for progression of cortical damage.
