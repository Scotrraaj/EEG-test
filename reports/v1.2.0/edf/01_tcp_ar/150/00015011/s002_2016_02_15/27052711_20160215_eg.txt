HISTORY:

53 y.o. FEMALE ADMITTED YESTERDAY AFTER SHE

STARTED ACTING "GOOFY" PER FAMILY, CONFUSED WITH POOR BALANCE,


AND MULTIPLE LOOSE STOOL. INTUBATED AND ADMITTED RICU AND

DEVELOPED HIGH FEVER. PMHX. EOTH ABUSE, CIRRHOSIS, DM, ANXIETY,

DEPRESSION 56 CM HEAD.



MEDICATIONS:

VERSED




TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity

with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of


frequencies.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1. Severe diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal routine EEG due to severe diffuse slowing.

This finding is indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which

is nonspecific with regards to etiology.
