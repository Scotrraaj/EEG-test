HISTORY:

43 y.o. female with a history of

intractable localization related epilepsy arising from the left


parietal-frontal region from previous abscess referred for

routine EEG for characterization of seizures. Tech notes a left

parieto-occipital skull defect.



MEDICATIONS:

mouth 2 times daily.

morning

seizures. ICD 10: R26.81 G40.109. Use as directed

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 800 mg tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 800 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3

times daily.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous, well organized, and


reactive, but asymmetric.

A posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz is seen symmetrically, but


higher in amplitude over the left.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

There is occasional subtle polymorphic slowing over the right


temporal region.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric


background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Higher amplitude posterior dominant rhythm over the left

2. Occasional subtle polymorphic slowing over the right temporal

region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of right temporal


dysfunction. A higher amplitude posterior dominant rhythm over

the left is consistent with the patient's history of left


parieto-occipital skull defect.

No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was


not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep

recording may provide additional information.
