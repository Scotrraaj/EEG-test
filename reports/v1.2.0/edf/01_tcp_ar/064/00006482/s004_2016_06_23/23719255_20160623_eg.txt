DATE OF STUDY: 06/23/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU rm 200


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only




HISTORY:

a 36 y.o. male with a history of paraplegia/quadriplegia following severe
motor vehicle accident, admitted with involuntary movements referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

MIDODRINE, BACLOFEN, PAROXETINE, PANTOPRAZOLE, GABAPENTIN, METHAFDONE,
TRAZADONE, KEPPRA, AND others



SEDATION: 4MG OF ATIVAN



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically challenging  record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.  The
patient had continual involuntary movements of the head and left arm was interactive during those
movements




EEG BACKGROUND:


The  background is characterized by continuous muscle artifact, beta and rocking artifact.
Underneath this, it appears that the overall background is low voltage and slow



Sleep is not captured



Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.  However, this is a limited study



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: The patient is interactive in consolable while having involuntary head
and arm movements


EVENTS:There are clinical events of rocking and left arm spontaneous clonus captured during this
study.  See above



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 103 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a Limited but abnormal ICU EEG due to:


1.  replacement normal background with a beta low voltage pattern


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This patient's clinical factors produce spasticity which obscures most of this EEG.  No electrographic
seizures were noted.  If possible, a repeat study with the pharmacologic management maybe
consider.


Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
