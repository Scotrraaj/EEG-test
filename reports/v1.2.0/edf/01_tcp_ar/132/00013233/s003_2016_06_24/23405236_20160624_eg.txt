DATE OF STUDY: 06/24/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 67 y.o. male with a history of seizures, TAVR, ESRD, afib, COPD, HTN, who is
referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS: Keppra



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 6.5-7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.






During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


Mild generalized slowing is present.


Frequent bitemporal independent shifting polymorphic slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm, irregular, is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing

2. Frequent bitemporal independent shifting polymorphic slowing

3. An irregular heart rate noted on a single EKG lead



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of bitemporal cerebral dysfunction superimposed on mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

An irregular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.







Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
