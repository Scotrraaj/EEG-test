HISTORY:

79 y.o. female with a history of bacterial

meningitis (12/13/15; with altered mental status and seizures)


referred for routine EEG for as a follow up study. During the

study the patient mentioned a

technician.



MEDICATIONS: Depakote



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies,


with a symmetric and reactive 8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm

(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present but suboptimal.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

There is abundant left hemispheric polymorphic delta slowing, at

times sharply contoured.

There is both synchronous and independent right hemispheric


polymorphic delta slowing, at times sharply contoured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Abundant left hemispheric polymorphic delta slowing, at times


sharply contoured.

3. Both synchronous and independent right hemispheric polymorphic


delta slowing, at times sharply contoured



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of a bihemispheric

dysfunction superimposed on mild diffuse global cerebral

dysfunction.
