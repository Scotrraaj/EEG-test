HISTORY:

55 y.o. female with a history of resection

of mass s/p bifrontal craniotomy s/p cardiac arrest referred for


routine EEG as a follow up study. Nurse notes no brain stem

functions; however patient is on sedation.



MEDICATIONS: versed, fentanyl drips ("maxed out" per technician

notes); Keppra, protonix, metoprolol, amlodipine, ancef, cipro



SEDATION: as noted above


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. Tech notes all impedences are < 10. The study


included a single channel of EKG.





BACKGROUND:


The waking background is suppressed. There is no reactivity to

noxious stimulation, variability, or state change.


When read at a sensitivity of 3 uV/mm, there is paroxsymal waxing

and waning beta and gamma activity seen diffusely that is not

clearly of cerebral origin.



There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

1. Rhythmic 15 Hz activity is seen diffusely in all leads,

lasting 600 msec, occurring every 4 seconds. It has the

appearance of ventilator artifact. Tech notes that patient


produces a

2. Frequent electrode artifact is noted in F8, F4



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:


1. Severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, without reactivity,

variability, or state change



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral

dysfunction, which may at least in part be associated with


sedating medication such as versed.

Paroxysmal activity noted above is most likely artifact.
