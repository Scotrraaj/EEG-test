HISTORY:

31 y.o. female S/P OD CODE. PT IS

INTUBATED ON VENTILATOR, EVALUATE FOR SZ



MEDICATIONS:

DEXAMETHASONE, PROPOFOL 80 PRIOR TO STARTING EEG



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically




with eye opening. The waking background is symmetric, reactive,

and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of


bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV,


5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases

during drowsiness.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. The QRS

complex appears prolonged.



IMPRESSION:

1. Excessive theta in wakefulness.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse

background slowing. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse


cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. Please

note the EKG was abnormal but this is a single channel recording


and if clinically necessary should be evaluated with a 12 lead

EKG.
