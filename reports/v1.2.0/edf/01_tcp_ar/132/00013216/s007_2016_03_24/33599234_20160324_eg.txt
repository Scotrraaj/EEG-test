HISTORY: This is a 18 y.o. right handed male undergoing continuous inpatient intracranial stereo-EEG (SEEG) video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring with a history of: refractory epilepsy.     Continuous SEEG video EEG is initiated for:  Recording of seizures for presurgical evaluation.  Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons: - The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate. - Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus; - The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;   - The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient’s exam  (9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service  CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING: Patient had 6 depth electrodes stereotactically placed into the left temporal region. The patient had a prior left temporal lobectomy and thus the depth electrodes were targeted to residual tissue within the resection bed visualized by pre-operative MRI. The plan of electrode placement was designed and confirmed in pre-surgical epilepsy conference. The location of the electrodes was confirmed by post-operative imaging.  These electrodes included: LA - left amygdalar remnant MG - left middle temporal gyrus FX - left fornix SG - left superior temporal gyrus A I- left anterior insula PI - left posterior insula   The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were not placed because prior EMU evaluation revealed no change in scalp EEG with clinical events. Impedances were measured and verified. Electrode position and identification was confirmed in the O.R. by technician and physician staff.  EEG activity was recorded digitized, and stored to computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.   Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.    The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.    MEDICATIONS: No current outpatient prescriptions on file. No current facility-administered medications for this visit.  SEDATION: None  DAY 1 (03/24/16, 10:00PM-03/25/2016, 06:00A)  BACKGROUND:  There is continuous rhythmic theta and delta activity seen in the LA, MG, and SG depth electrodes. Low voltage beta activity predominates in the FX and insular electrodes. There is occasional sharply contoured delta in the FX and insular electrodes as well.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Sharply contoured delta activity in left LA electrode.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: See events below.  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: At 11:33:19PM, the patient pushes the button for a clinical episode of fear and anxiety that is characteristic or his outpatient/pre-operative events. At this point there are periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs) seen that evolve from the deeper FX electrode contacts 1-4 over 8 seconds. There is then attenuation of the FX activity followed by sudden buildup of very high frequency, low voltage activity (LVFA) in FX 1-3, that evolves and persists for 9 seconds, then stops abruptly. Clinically, he returns to baseline immediately, as is typical of his outpatient events.  Identical electrographic events occur during sleep (without overt clinical correlate) at 1:14:01AM, 2:39:53AM, 3:10:07AM, and 3:48:14AM. Patient had no recollection of these events.   EKG: A single lead captured normal sinus rhythm.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: Single seizure with typical features (fear and anxiety) emanating from left FX electrode. There were 4 electrographic seizures during sleep without clinical correlate that also evolved from the FX electrode. These data suggest a highly epileptogenic focus in the left FXtissue remnant.    -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (03/25/16, 06:00 - 03/26/2016, 06:00)  AEDs: NONE  INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: There is no change in the background cerebral activity over the 6 depth electrodes as described on Day 1.   Sleep:  There is some slowing noted during periods of clinical sleep.  SEIZURES/EVENTS: During this 24-hour recording epoch there were both clinical and electrographic seizures recorded.  Clinical seizures were described as sensations of fear and anxiety. A seizure denoted by a pushbutton at 3:53:12PM lasted approximately 10-15 seconds but was accompanied by no clear change in cerebral activity. In contrast, a seizure at 6:51:01PM lasted 6-8 seconds and was accompanied by PEDs in the left FX electrode.   Electrographic seizures were without clinical correlate and were accompanied by PEDs, LVFA, or both as described above on Day 1, emanating from left FX electrode, of varying duration (4-10 seconds). Patient had no recollection or awareness of these events.   3/25/16 12:07:01P LVFA 3/25/16 2:38:56P PEDs/LVF 3/25/16 8:03:19PM PEDs 3/25/16 8:55:41P PEDs 3/25/16 11:32;21P PEDs/LVFA 3/26/16 1:14:24AM PEDs/LVFA 3/26/16 2:29:49AM PEDs/LVFA 3/26/16 3:10:07A PEDs/LVFA 3/26/16 3:48:14AM PEDs/LVFA 3/26/16 4:00:56AM PEDs  EKG: A single lead captured normal sinus rhythm.  DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: Two seizures with typical features (fear and anxiety) emanating from left FX electrode.
