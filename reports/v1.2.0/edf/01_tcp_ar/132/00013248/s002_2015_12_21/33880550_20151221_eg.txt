CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 60-year-old male found down on


December 14th with traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, skull

fracture, went on to have right craniotomy.  Left frontal EVD.

Now, with right upper gaze deviation.



MEDICATIONS:  Keppra. No others listed.



INTRODUCTION:  Twenty four minute digital video EEG was performed

at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement

with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated, but was


examined during the EEG.  There was no record of the use of

sedative, hypnotic medications in the report provided by the

technologist.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a medium

amplitude pattern with a mixed frequency pattern.  There are


lower voltage theta and delta frequency activity.  Intermittent,




subtle attenuations were noted, with attenuation or at least a

decrease in amplitude of the background.  These effects last 1 to


3 seconds and are not entirely a burst suppression pattern.  In

the sections of the record with more vigorous cerebral activity,


there is right frontal delta.  There is also a lower voltage

right frontal fast wave or lower voltage frontal sharp wave noted

intermittently.  Rare left frontal sharp waves were also noted.

Tactile stimulation of the patient seem to produce an attenuation


of cerebral activity lasting 7 seconds in duration.



Heart rate 144 bpm.


IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:

1. A low voltage slow pattern.


2. Intermittent attenuation of the background.

3. The phenomenon of attenuation of the background with tactile


stimulation.

4. Intermittent sharp waves noted from either frontal region,

right greater than left.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The

epileptiform features noted were in the region of the previous


cranial defect and may have been accentuated by that fact.  In

the absence of the use of sedative, hypnotic medications, the

background described above is a worrisome pattern.
