HISTORY:

This is a 24 y.o. right handed male undergoing continuous


inpatient video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring with a

history of: refractory epilepsy.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal

events.




Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more

of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or


clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and




morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and

determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left


untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual

mortality rate.


- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient

number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are

reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures

and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures

and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient


safety during seizures;

- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these

medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses

to document patient's exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG

monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service




CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of

monitoring.  The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG


monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were

placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20


international electrode system.  Additionally, T1 and T2

electrodes were placed in this patient.  Sphenoidal electrodes

were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and

verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded


referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to

computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently


reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.



Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and

computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG


activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8

hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A


neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.

The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a


registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and

testing.  During times when a technician was not available, EEG


recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and

nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.




The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program

(trademark named

time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.


Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were

reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and


detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external

hard drive media.



HISTORY:


24 y.o. male with a history of possible

generalized tonic-clonic seizures referred for EEG for evaluation


of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions at time of admission:


divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by

mouth 2 times daily.




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None

TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.




DAY 1 (01/11/2016, 10:21AM - 1/12/2016, 06:0AM0)




BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized,

and consists predominantly of alpha and beta activity.




Posterior dominant rhythm was 9Hz, symmetric and reactive to


light.



The background is reactive, variable.




There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.




Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured..

Overall summary:


The patient was monitored for 5 days with continuous video EEG.

During this time, his medications were discontinued and he was


sleep deprived. No clinical events were captured and no

interictal abnormalities were identified.


This is a non-diagnostic videoEEG EMU admission because no

clinical events were captured. These findings were discussed with


the patient as well as the possible need for future monitoring.

The fact that a diagnosis of epilepsy was still possible was


discussed. Re-starting medication was offered to patient but he

declined.



He will follow u as an outpatient for further care
