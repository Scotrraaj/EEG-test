HISTORY:

43 y.o. female with a history of convulsions since 2014, with a possible seizure in
during MRI today, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, TAKE ONE CAPSULE BY MOUTH TWO TIMES A DAY
WITH MEALS
amoxicillin (AMOXIL) 500 mg capsule, TAKE TWO CAPSULES BY MOUTH TWO TIMES A DAY


clarithromycin (BIAXIN) 500 mg tablet, TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH TWO TIMES A DAY

NIFEdipine (ADALAT CC) 30 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 30 mg by mouth daily.

IRON,CARBONYL/VIT C/VIT B12/FA (IRON 100 PLUS PO), Take  by mouth.


CETIRIZINE HCL/PSEUDOEPHEDRINE (ZYRTEC-D PO), Take  by mouth.

hydrocortisone (ANUSOL-HC) 25 mg suppository, Place 1 suppository rectally at bedtime.

montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth nightly.


fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray, Inhale 2 sprays into the nose daily.

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 100 mg tablet, Take 1.5 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

1. Occasional left temporal sharp waves are noted in drowsiness. These have an appearance most
consistent with a benign variant (wicket waves).



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy 1 hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy 1 hour EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.


Occasional left temporal sharp waves in drowsiness are most consistent with a benign variant (wicket
waves).
