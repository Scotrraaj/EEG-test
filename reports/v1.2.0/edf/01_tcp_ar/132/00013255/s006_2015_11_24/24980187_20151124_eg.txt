HISTORY: 28 y.o. female with a history of possible seizures referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.  MEDICATIONS: Current Outpatient Prescriptions: alprazolam (XANAX) 1 mg tablet,  benzonatate (TESSALON) 100 mg capsule,  diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) 50 mg capsule,  doxycycline (VIBRAMYCIN) 100 mg capsule,  famotidine (PEPCID) 20 mg tablet,  levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 100 mg/mL solution,  carbamazepine (TEGRETOL) 100 mg/5 mL suspension, Take 400 mg by mouth 2 times daily. levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. folic acid (FOLVITE) 1 mg tablet, Take 4 tablets by mouth daily. Albuterol 90 mcg/actuation Aerosol, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every 4 hours. ALPRAZolam (XANAX) 2 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth nightly as needed. ALBUTEROL IN, Inhale  into the lungs.  No current facility-administered medications for this visit.  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/24/2016, 9:54AM - 11/25/2016, 06:00AM)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of 9-10Hz posterior dominant rhythm.    Posterior dominant rhythm was present. There was excessive drowsiness throughout the recording epoch with frequent periods of clinical sleep.  The background is reactive, and variable.  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was seen briefly.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: There was a single event of unresponsiveness that occurred at 10:37:08AM lasting approximately 2-3 minutes associated clinically with eye flutter. The patient was unresponsive to verbal commands and did not exhibit motor responses to commands.   EKG: A single lead captured normal sinus rhythm.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a normal 24-hour video EEG capturing wakefulness and sleep. A single clinical episode of unresponsiveness was without a change in the background cerebral activity.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (11/25/2016, 06:00 - 11/25/2016, 3:00PM)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: None  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: None  EKG: A single EKG lead captured normal sinus rhythm.   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  This is a normal 9 hour video EEG capturing wakefulness and sleep.
