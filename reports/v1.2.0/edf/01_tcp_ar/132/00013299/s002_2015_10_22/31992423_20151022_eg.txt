CLINICAL HISTORY: A 71-year-old woman status post PEA code for 45 minutes 2 days prior to this admission. Previously evaluated after lung transplant for trembling.
MEDICATIONS: Vasopressin, epinephrine, dopamine. No sedative/hypnotic medications listed.
INTRODUCTION: A routine 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient appeared to be comatose without any involuntary movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG is markedly suppressed and is almost, in fact, completely suppressed. The periods of low voltage suppressed pattern are intermittently interrupted by 1 to 3- second bursts of relatively rhythmic 4 Hz activity, typically maximum in the frontal regions with some variability and at times, some theta. The activity is not so stereotypic as to suggest an artifact, but is quite intermittent. Tactile stimulation of the patient did not activate the record.
Heart rate: 73 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG for a subject 48 hours status post code due to:
	•	A nearly suppressed cerebral pattern.
	•	Absence of reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were discussed with the consult team who had a chance to review the pattern personally. No clinical seizures were noted. This EEG carries a worrisome prognosis.
