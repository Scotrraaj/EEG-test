HISTORY:


28 y.o. male referred for routine EEG for

recurrent

nocturnal seizures: GTCs. Tongue biting BL. Urinary incontinence.


Diffuse myalgia


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 25 mg tablet, 1tab QDX7days, 1tab

BIDX7days, 1tab qam & 2tabs QHSX7days, 2tabs BIDx7 days, 3tabs


BIDx7days, then start 100 mg BID

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 3 capsules by mouth

daily.


lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 100 mg tablet, Take 1.5 tablets by mouth 2

times daily. Take this dose after you complete the titration

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.






SEDATION: none



TECHNIQUE:

Digital video  21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording


using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes was performed

utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory

record and included a single channel of EKG , HVand photic


stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive low

voltage 8.5-9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which


attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric

vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage

II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.



No generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Produced an increase in amplitude of the


background as well as a small amount of theta



Photic Stimulation: was performed as patient transitioned to

stage II sleep, elicited trivial driving


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG. There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy. This is the third normal EEG for this subject.
