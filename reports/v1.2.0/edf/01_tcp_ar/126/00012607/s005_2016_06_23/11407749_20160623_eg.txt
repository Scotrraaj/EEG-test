HISTORY:

This is a 47 y.o. female undergoing continuous inpatient video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: gunshot wound to right hemisphere and episodic right arm shaking.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patientÂ’s exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.




MEDICATIONS:

Phenobarbital 90 q12h


Gabapentin 600 mg q8h


SEDATION: Ativan



DAY 1 (6/23/2016, 23:40 - 6/24/2016, 22:00)



BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of low
voltage fast frequencies. Posterior dominant rhythm is 10 Hz and attenuates symmetrically with eye
opening.



There is occasional subtle polymorphic frequency slowing over the right posterior quadrant seen in
drowsiness.




Drowsiness is characterized by background slowing with increased theta frequencies.



Sleep was characterized by symmetric POSTS, sleep spindles and K-complexes.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

Technician noted that prior to the beginning of this study, patient had "4 events of body stiffening,
with her face becoming red, and difficulty breathing.  As the events ended, she took a deep breath,
then event stopped. Each event lasted about 30 sec to >1 minute."




6/24/2016 at 11:55

CLINICAL: patient lying in bed. Rubs head with right hand. Husband at bedside. Stops rubbing head,
then resumes several seconds later. Appears uncomfortable.  Stiffens left arm, then tonically holds
right arm to face. Cries. Husband appears able to move the right arm. Husband says, "she's having a
seizure right now." Patient is turned away from husband. She shakes right arm intermittently,
nonrhythmically, when he lets go of it. She is breathing deeply. Eyes are closed. Eventually she
follows a command to open her eyes. Has waxing-waning left shoulder jerking and nonsynchronous
right arm jerking. Appears to be crying. Follows some simple commands and verbally responds.
Duration: ~7 min 32 sec.





EEG: no ictal EEG changes, other than muscle artifact, are present. Posterior dominant rhythm is
seen intermittently.


EKG: no change in HR in a single EKG lead


6/24/2016 at 12:33


CLINICAL: Lying in bed with hand covering eyes. Husband pushes button. patient's right arm bends
and shakes, nonrhythmically, which husband is able to suppress. She begins crying, pulling away
from husband. Not responding to questions. Shaking stops and starts and involves right trunk
intermittently. She is able to be turned on back, moans, breathes deeply. Within 2 minutes she
responds to command to open eyes, but only left eye opens. She complains of severe headache,
10/10, and begins crying, says her "eyes feel like they are twitching". Duration: 3 min 55 sec.



EEG: no ictal EEG changes, other than muscle artifact, are present. Posterior dominant rhythm is
seen intermittently.


EKG: no change in HR in a single EKG lead



EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s





DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal video EEG due to:

1. Occasional subtle polymorphic frequency slowing over the right posterior quadrant, seen in
drowsiness


2. Two episodes described above, consistent semiologically and electrographically with nonepileptic
behavioral events

DAY 2 (6/24/2016,  - 6/25/2016, 9:00)



MEDICATIONS:

Phenobarbital 90 q12h


Gabapentin 600 mg q8h


INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:


The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is  symmetric and reaches  10 Hz. There is lambda notes on
the left.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured..


Mild asymmetries are noted in sleep.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none



SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



EKG: A single lead captured 90-120 BPM


Overall impression and clinical correlation:



No epileptiform seizures were idenitfied. The behaviors seemed to be emotional in nature. Focal
slowing may be correlated with imaging.
