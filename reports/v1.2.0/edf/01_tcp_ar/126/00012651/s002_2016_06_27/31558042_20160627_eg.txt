DATE OF STUDY: 06/27/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 60 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 44 y.o. WOMAN WITH  PMHX OF BRAIN CANCER DX . CRANIOTOMY
LEFT PCC/PAR ON SEPT 2ND FOR RESECTION. PT WAS ON KEPPRA AND TAKEN OFF 3
WEEKS AGO, THEN 4 DAYS LATER PT HAD A SZ. PT IS NOW BACK ON KEPPRA.



PMH: MELANOMA CA

FOLLOW  UP 1 HOUR



MEDICATIONS:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG,HV and photic.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies. There is an 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) seen best on the
right.  The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left posterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. There is an associated increased amplitude and faster
frequencies in the area consistent with a breach rhythm.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


1. Continuous focal slowing in the left posterior temporal region and breach



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the left
posterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this
region, likely structural in origin and consistent with the tumor resection.




Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.



Attending Epileptologist:
I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
