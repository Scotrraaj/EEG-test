DATE OF STUDY: 04/29/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 55 y.o. male with a history of childhood epilepsy.  Clinicians think that he is
seizure free but he insists that he is still having seizures , referred for routine EEG for characterization
of seizures.


Endorses hallucinations


MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, (VITAMIN D) 1,000 unit Capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.


lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily.

LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM (SYNTHROID PO), Take 0.05 mg by mouth.

OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 300 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.


lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 200 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is noted & includes vertex waves



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Photic Stimulation: there is scant driving.


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. slow alpha rhythm




2. Mild generalized background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings were a mild diffuse disturbance of cerebral  function.  No epileptiform features were
identified
