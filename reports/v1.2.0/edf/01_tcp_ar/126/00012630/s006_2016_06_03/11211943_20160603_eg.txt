HISTORY:

62 YR OLD MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O POSS. NEW STROKE AM, PT SEEN
AT PC WHEN NOTED WITH SLURRED SPEECH. PMHX SIG FOR OLD LT SIDED CVA WITH RESID
RT SIDED WEAKNESS. S/P ANEURYSM REMOVAL





MEDICATIONS:


No AEDs


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:



The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontal region with an associated
increased in amplitude and faster frequencies in the region consistent with a breach. At times these
waveforms are sharply contoured.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Continuous focal slowing in the left frontal region and associated breach



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the left frontal
region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural
in origin.
