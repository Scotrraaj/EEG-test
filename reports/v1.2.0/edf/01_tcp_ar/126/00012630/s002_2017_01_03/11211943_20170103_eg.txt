DATE OF STUDY: 01/03/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 63 y.o. male with a history of intracranial aneurysm s/p coiling (left fronto-
temporal craniotomy), noted with tremor of body, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of
paroxysmal events (tremor).




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 3-15 Units

carvedilol (COREG) tablet 6.25 mg

valsartan (DIOVAN) tablet 320 mg

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous, reactive, and asymmetric.

The right hemisphere consists of fairly organized alpha and beta with excess delta. There are
fragments of a posterior dominant rhythm that approaches 8.5 Hz.


The left hemisphere consists of continuous medium amplitude polymorphic delta (frontal
predominant), poorly organized.



Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by further background slowing. There are no well defined
sleep transients captured.



Mild-moderate generalized slowing is present.

Continuous left hemispheric (frontal predominant) medium amplitude polymorphic slowing is
present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None






ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild-moderate generalized slowing

2. Continuous left hemispheric (frontal predominant) medium amplitude polymorphic slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of left hemispheric (frontal predominant) cerebral dysfunction
which is likely structural in etiology. The higher amplitude slowing over the left frontal region is
consistent with this patient's known history of skull defect in this region. There is additional evidence
for a mild-moderate diffuse dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
