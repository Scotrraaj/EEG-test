 HISTORY: This is a 42 y.o. right handed male admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology. Recent onset refractory events: Left leg twitches, may fall off chair, legs give out. He denies LOC, but (wife) says he does - he wakes up after 1 min or so. Wife says she times them. Patient thinks she is overexaggerating - 30 sec. He does smell smoke before. Continuous video EEG is initiated for: Evaluation of paroxysmal events.  Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons: - The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and morbidity risk. Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options. If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate. - Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus; - The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;  - The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient’s exam There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service  

CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring. The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system. Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case. Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms. EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive. Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.  Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior. For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24 hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician. A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day. The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing. During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.   The spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges. Samples of EEG were recorded periodically. Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist. All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

BACKGROUND:  The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of 10 Hz alpha with admixed frontocentral beta. Posterior dominant rhythm was Present. Lambda was noted.  The background is reactive, variable. There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements and rhythmic alpha and theta frequency activity which was relatively diffuse. Sleep was characterized by vertex waves, POSTS and spindles and a few K complexes  

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY none 

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: none  

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation: did not activate the record Photic Stimulation: elicits a driving response  

EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.  
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: Remarkable for a great deal of muscle artifact. The technologist worked to try and alleviate this. No epileptiform abnormalities were identified
