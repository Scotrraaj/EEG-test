HISTORY:

42 y.o. male with a history of suspected focal epilepsy of right hemispheric origin
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

sertraline (ZOLOFT) 50 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) Take 600 mg by mouth every 8 hours.


zolpidem (AMBIEN) 10 mg tablet,

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily for 360 days.

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 25 mg tablet, Wk 1: 25 mg qhs; Wk 2: 25 mg q12h; Wk 3: 25 mg in AM and
50 mg in PM; Wk 4: 50 mg q12h




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:




A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of low voltage alpha and a
moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive low voltage 10-11 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Distinct drowsiness is difficult to discern in this low voltage background. Transients of stage I or II
sleep were not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only 1-hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only 1-hour EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

This the 2nd normal EEG for this patient


If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
