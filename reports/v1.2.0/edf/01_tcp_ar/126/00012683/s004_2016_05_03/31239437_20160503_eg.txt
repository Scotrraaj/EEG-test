HISTORY:

23 y.o. male with a history of JME vs possible secondarily generalized
seizures referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


clonazePAM (KLONOPIN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly as needed for Anxiety (as
needed PRN).


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, 1 tablet in the morning, and 1.5 in the PM

venlafaxine (EFFEXOR-XR) 150 mg 24 hr capsule, Take 150 mg by mouth daily. Indications:
depression


SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and an excess
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





Drowsiness and sleep are not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.


Excess beta can be seen in the setting of certain medications such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.



Excess beta can be seen in the setting of certain medications such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
