SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable continuous  Digital video 21 channel

electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International

10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system.


This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single

channel of EKG, seizure and spike detection and tactile


stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is markedly abnormal but dynamic.  The initial


sections include continuous, frontally predominant delta, with

bilateral triphasic waves. This alternates with a better


organized pattern with alpha and theta frequency activity.


Generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: There are infrequent sharp waves, simple

in morphology noted in the frontal regions, O2 and independently


in the temporal regions.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Triphasic waves



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Tactile stimulation produces alerting


with an increase in alpha and theta frequency and decrease in

triphasic waves.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is 24 hour video EEG.  Is remarkable for:


Triphasic waves

Generalized slowing, at times severe

Simple sharp waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This pattern is supportive of a metabolic encephalopathy. No


seizures were recorded.
