RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: 

EEG TYPE: Long term recording






HISTORY:

This is a 46 y.o. FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SCHIZOPHRENIA, SEIZURE DISORDER, STROKE
3/2014 WITH LT SIDED WEAKNESS. NOW STATES SZ X 3 DAYS AGO WITH LOC AND
POSTICTAL CONFUSION. PT STATES THAT SHE HAS A SZ EVERY THREE DAYS. TODAY HAD
AN EVENT OF UNRESPONSIVENESS WHILE IN THE OFFICE.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events. Differential diagnosis.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.









- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.




MEDICATIONS:


KEPPRA, KLONOPIN, DOXEPIN, DRONABNOL, RISPERDAL, ATORVO QUONE, PERPHENAZINE


SEDATION: None



DAY 1 (7/05/2016, 18:34 - 7/06/2016, 09:00)



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not
produce any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



DAY 1 IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep only routine EEG. There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.






SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:

Interictal Findings:

None





Ictal Findings:

The patient had no clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the
epilepsy monitoring unit.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. None



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Possible PNES



CONCLUSION:

 was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 1 day with continuous video EEG.  This
was an inconclusive EMU monitoring session because no events were captured and the patient was
not cooperating with the team.




The patient had a discussion about nonepileptic events and their association with
underlying psychiatric co-morbidities and are not due to abnormal electrical discharges of the
brain/cortex.



We recommend that he/she to see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying
psychopathology and diagnosis.







I have personally reviewed and interpreted this study, and this report represents my findings and
conclusions.
