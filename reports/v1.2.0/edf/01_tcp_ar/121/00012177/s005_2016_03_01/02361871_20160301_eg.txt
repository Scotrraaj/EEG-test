HISTORY:

76 y.o. female with a history of possible


seizures referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal

Events.  The family notes that the patient has screaming spells.

The patient herself is aware of dizzy spells.  History of


cirrhosis splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia.  Dementia with

Montr√©al cognitive assessment score of 15.



MEDICATIONS:

escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) 5 mg tablet, on hold

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.


QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth nightly.

multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth

daily.


lactulose (CHRONULAC) 10 gram/15 mL solution, Take 30 g by mouth

3 times daily.

Flagyl


SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


Continuous video EEG monitoring A 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and spike detection software.

Attempts were made to keep the patient out of bed and to keep her


activated were unsuccessful.  Each day, if she was out of bed and

asked to bicycle, she got back in bed.  She typically reported


dizziness on rounds when asked directly, but she never pushed the

button for a dizzy spell.  No episodes of screaming or aggressive

or inappropriate behavior were recorded.

DAY 1 (03/01, - 3/2/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: none


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  She reported dizziness between noon and 1 PM.  A


normal awake pattern was noted at this time.  She did not press

the button or report the symptoms to the nurses


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

Impression:


Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this

is a normal 24 hour EEG.  The dizzy spells did not have any EEG

correlate.



DAY 2 (03/02, - 3/3/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: none

EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5


Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen. FIRDA was seen in the transition to


sleep.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  Patient behaviors, such as attempted removal of EEG

electrodes were noted



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


Impression:

Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this

is a normal 24 hour EEG.  FIRDA is a normal finding in the

transition to sleep.

DAY 3 (03/03, - 34/2016, 010:00 AM)



AEDs: none

EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5


Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen. FIRDA was seen in the transition to


sleep.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and. Slow

wave sleep was not captured.  Likely REM was noted at 02:38 AM



Intermittent, mild generalized slowing is present. No focal

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

FIRDA- drowsiness only



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none successful


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.  Patient behaviors were unremarkable- she prefers to


stay in bed and is inattentive.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54- 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


Impression:

Though none of the patient's typical spells were captured, this


is a normal 24 hour EEG.  FIRDA is a normal finding in the

transition to sleep.




IMPRESSION:

This three-day continuous video EEG monitoring session was


unremarkable.  The overall background is within normal limits for

an adult of this age.  Although the patient occasionally endorsed


dizziness, she never pushed the button and review of the EEG at

those times did not identify any abnormalities.  None of her


disruptive behaviors which are current home were elicited.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.  Careful review of the home situation, for this elderly

woman with dementia, may help explain the screaming spells and

prevent further behaviors.
