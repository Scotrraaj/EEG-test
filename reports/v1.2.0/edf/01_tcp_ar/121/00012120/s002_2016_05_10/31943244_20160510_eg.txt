HISTORY:

20 y.o. female with a history of seizures referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


LO LOESTRIN FE 1 mg-10 mcg (24)/10 mcg (2) Tablet,

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, 1 in AM and 1.5 in the pm 1250 mg qd  Indications: 500
in AM 750  in PM


clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 0.5 mg disintegrating tablet, One under the tongue for any seizure longer
than three minutes



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5-10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and
produces bilaterally synchronous, sharply contoured slow waves.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
