HISTORY:

27 y.o. WOMAN  WITH H/O SZS SINCE 2012 PER PT.

LAST SZ / ANXIETY ATTACK NOV. 25 LASTING, PT STATES, LOC AND


POSTICAL CONFUSION/SHAKING AND    STRONG PSYCH H/O CONVERSION

D/O, DEPRESSION, BIPOLAR D/O.



MEDICATIONS:

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 150 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2

times daily.


topiramate (TOPAMAX) 100 mg tablet, Take 1.5 tablets by mouth 2

times daily.

clonazePAM (KLONOPIN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth 2 times


daily as needed for Anxiety.




SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
