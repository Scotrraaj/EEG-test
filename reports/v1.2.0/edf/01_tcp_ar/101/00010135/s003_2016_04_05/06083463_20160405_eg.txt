HISTORY:

52 y.o. MAN WITH A HX OF LEFT FRONTAL

ENCEPHALOMALCIA S/P SURGERY A FEW YEARS AGO. PT HAS SZ DAILY.


.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

loratadine (CLARITIN) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.

amLODIPine (NORVASC) 5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray, Inhale 2

sprays into the nose daily.

naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times


daily (with meals).

levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2

times daily.







SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
