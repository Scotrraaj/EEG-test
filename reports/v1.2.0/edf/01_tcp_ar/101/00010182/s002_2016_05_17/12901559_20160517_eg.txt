DATE OF STUDY: 05/17/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 51 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy, confused and lightheaded. She tries to
to speak but unable to do so. She then loses consciousness and proceeds to have a GTC referred for
routine EEG for characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray,


FLOVENT HFA 220 mcg/actuation inhaler,

medroxyPROGESTERone (DEPO-PROVERA) 150 mg/mL injection,

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 100 mg by mouth 3 times daily.


ASPIRIN/ACETAMINOPHEN/CAFFEINE (EXCEDRIN MIGRAINE PO), Take  by mouth 2 times daily.

LORazepam (ATIVAN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet ~ 30 minutes before the scan and then, if needed,
take another tablet right before the scan


ALBUTEROL IN, Inhale  into the lungs every 4 hours as needed.

divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 500 mg EC tablet,

Riboflavin 100 mg Tablet, Take 200 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


SUMATRIPTAN SUCCINATE (IMITREX PO), Take  by mouth.


GUAIFENESIN/PHENYLEPHRINE/HCOD (QUAL-TUSSIN DC ORAL), Take  by mouth every 4 hours as
needed.


ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet, Take 325 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. POSTS are present



Sleep is not sustained


No generalized slowing is present.


Left focal slowing is present.  There is intermittent focal slowing noted on the left with occasional
bursts of left temporal delta, and some bursts of sharply contoured delta.  This is noted
hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  There is a clear T3 phase reversal with the focal slowing



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


See above


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


wicket


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: {EEGACTIV:2101300077






Hyperventilation: Produces both rhythmic generalized slowing and some left temporal focal slowing



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Left temporal focal slowing, intermittent

2. infrequent, clear T3 sharply contoured slowing without definitive sharp wave



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are supportive of a focal process in the left hemisphere and potentially a focal
mechanism for seizures.
