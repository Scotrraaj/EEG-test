HISTORY:

54 y.o. female with a history of nocturnal

sz 01/09/2016  referred for routine EEG for evaluation of


paroxysmal events. Hx PSTD and ETOH.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

albuterol (PROVENTIL) 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) nebulizer solution,

SYMBICORT 160-4.5 mcg/actuation inhaler,


ALPRAZOLAM (XANAX PO), Take  by mouth.

FLUOXETINE HCL (PROZAC PO), Take  by mouth.

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 400 mg by mouth


daily. 4 pill at hs

multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth

daily.


folic acid (FOLVITE) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth daily.




thiamine 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening. The wake background is lower voltage.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  Patient

transitions  Between wake and sleep often.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy. This is the second normal EEG for this adult.
