HISTORY:

53 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy, empty sella, pseudotumor cerebri referred
for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

prazosin (MINIPRESS) 5 mg capsule, Take 5 mg by mouth nightly.

valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide (DIOVAN-HCT) 320-12.5 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


cetirizine (ZYRTEC) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 800 mg tablet, Take 800 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for Pain.

paroxetine (PAXIL) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth every morning.


glipiZIDE (GLUCOTROL) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth 2 times daily (before meals).

METOPROLOL SUCCINATE PO, Take 100 mg by mouth.

AMLODIPINE BESYLATE (AMLODIPINE PO), Take 10 mg by mouth.


aspirin 81 mg chewable tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.

METFORMIN HCL (METFORMIN PO), Take 1,000 mg by mouth 2 times daily.



PHENYTOIN SODIUM EXTENDED (DILANTIN PO), Take 100 mg by mouth 3 times daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements are seen.


Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces scant
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:




There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
