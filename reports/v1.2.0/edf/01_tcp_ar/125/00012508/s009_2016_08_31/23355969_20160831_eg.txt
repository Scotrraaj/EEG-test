HISTORY: This is a 27 y.o. right handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring with a history of: refractory epilepsy. Recent seizure with L Todd's paralysis.  Seizures begin with L HA, L ocular twitching and then L weakness     Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Recording of seizures for presurgical evaluation.  Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons: - The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate. - Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus; - The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;   - The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient’s exam There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service  CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.   Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.   Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24 hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.    The spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.    MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) inhaler 2 puff albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 2.5 mg amitriptyline (ELAVIL) tablet 25 mg gabapentin (NEURONTIN) capsule 300 mg hydrocortisone 1 % cream oxybutynin (DITROPAN) tablet 5 mg Quetiapine (SEROQUEL) tablet 100 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 200 mg  SEDATION:  None  DAY 1 (-8/29/2016, 14:00)  BACKGROUND:  The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric,  well-organized, and consists predominantly of  alpha with admixed beta. Posterior dominant rhythm was  Present.
