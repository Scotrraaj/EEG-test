HISTORY: 70 y.o. male with a history of brain tumor and seizures, now presents in status epilepticus.   MEDICATIONS: Current Outpatient Prescriptions: LEVETIRACETAM (KEPPRA PO), Take  by mouth. MULTIVITAMIN W/IRON, MINERALS (CENTRAVITES 50 PLUS PO), Take  by mouth. LISINOPRIL PO, Take  by mouth. amlodipine (NORVASC) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily. fenofibrate (TRICOR) 145 mg tablet, Take 145 mg by mouth daily.  No current facility-administered medications for this visit.   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG   DAY 1   BACKGROUND:  The study opens to a background that is continuous, asymmetric, and poorly organized. The right hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of delta with admixed theta and beta. The left hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of delta, theta, alpha, and beta. There are waveforms of higher amplitude and admixed faster frequencies noted over the left hemisphere, maximum over the fronto-temporal region (Fp1, F7).   Sleep spindles are captured.    EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: 1. Continuous 1-1.5 Hz sharp-and-slow-wave discharges, left frontotemporal maximum (max F7, T3, F3, C3; also known as lateralized periodic discharges, LPDs). Occasionally these fluctuate in frequency, occurring at up to 3 Hz for periods <5 seconds, without clear evolution.   OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.    IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to: 1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing, which improves to mild over the course of the recording, with suboptimal organization 2. Continuous left hemispheric (fronto-temporal max) polymorphic slowing 3. Waveforms of higher amplitude and admixed faster frequencies noted over the left hemisphere, maximum over the fronto-temporal region (Fp1, F7), likely representing breach rhythm 4. Continuous left fronto-temporal lateralized periodic discharges that occasionally fluctuate  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings indicate the presence of highly epileptogenic discharges over the left fronto-temporal region, superimposed on left hemisphere dysfunction that is likely structural in etiology. There is additionally mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which improves over the course of the recording to "mild." A left fronto-temporal breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known history of craniotomy. No definite electrographic seizures were captured.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal 15-hour long term video EEG due to:  1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing 2. Continuous left hemispheric (fronto-temporal max) polymorphic slowing 3. Waveforms of higher amplitude and admixed faster frequencies noted over the left hemisphere, maximum over the fronto-temporal region (Fp1, F7), likely representing breach rhythm 4. Continuous left fronto-temporal lateralized periodic discharges that occasionally fluctuate  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings indicate the presence of highly epileptogenic discharges over the left fronto-temporal region, superimposed on left hemisphere dysfunction that is likely structural in etiology. There is additionally mild to moderate diffuse cerebral Dysfunction. A left fronto-temporal breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known history of craniotomy.  No definite electrographic seizures were captured.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2   BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: continuous and without change  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected    DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Degree of diffuse and focal slowing is without significant change.  Left anterior quadrant quasi-PLEDs and PLEDs persist at ~ 1-1.25 Hz.  There continues to be an irritable epileptogenic focus over the left anterior quadrant.    No definite electrographic seizures were captured.
