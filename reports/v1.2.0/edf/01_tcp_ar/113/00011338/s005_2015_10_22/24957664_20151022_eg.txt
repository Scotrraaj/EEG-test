CLINICAL HISTORY: A 56-year-old right-handed woman with childhood epilepsy and multiple, bihemispheric strokes. The patient was admitted with stroke and right facial droop. She is persistently drowsy, but can be aroused.
INTRODUCTION: A 22 minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient was initially markedly somnolent with a brief arousal to stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with initially of 4 hertz theta pattern. There are intermittent bursts of rhythmic bifrontal delta and some bursts of shifting delta. Stimulation of the patient produces muscle.
Towards the close of the record, the patient seems to be a bit more arousable with eye movement and an increase in 4-6 hertz theta. The sleep pattern was characterized by vertex waves and spindles.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal bedside portable EEG due to:
	•	Marked generalized background slowing.
	•	Hypersomnolence.
	•	Shifting delta.
	•	FIRDA
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter. In this adult with childhood epilepsy, no epileptiform features were seen. The patient does appear to be clinically very sleepy, but no seizures were recorded.
