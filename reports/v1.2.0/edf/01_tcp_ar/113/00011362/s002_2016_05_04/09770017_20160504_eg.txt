HISTORY:

50 y.o. WOMAN WITH PMHX OF SEIZURES.  WAS SZ FREE FOR >5 YRS.
NOW WITH ANOTHER SZ THE OTHER DAY.  PUT BACK ON DEPAKOTE.   PT WITH BRAIDS.



MEDICATIONS:

divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER)



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.






During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the T3 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.



No generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent sharp waves are present with phase reversal in the T3>>>T4 regions.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Frequent left mid temporal and rare right mid temporal sharp waves

2. Intermittent left mid-temporal focal slow waves






CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of a epileptogenic foci in the bilateral mid-temporal regions. In
addition there is evidence of intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region.  This finding
is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
