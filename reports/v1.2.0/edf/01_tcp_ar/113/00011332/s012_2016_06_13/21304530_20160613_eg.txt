HISTORY: 69 y.o. male with a history of small cell lung cancer s/p resection, COPD, intractable hiccups, and seizures in setting of R frontal meningioma (s/p recent gamma knife, skull defect at F4) referred for EEG for assessment after the development of acute onset right arm proximal weakness.  MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital lacosamide Phenytoin   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (6/13/2016, 19:20 - 6/14/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, reactive, and asymmetric. The left hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of alpha, theta, and beta, with a posterior dominant rhythm of 7-8 Hz. The right hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of theta and alpha; posterior dominant rhythm is less clearly seen.  Drowsiness is characterized by fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and further background slowing. During brief periods of sleep, well-formed sleep transients are not seen.  At first the study is affected by runs of what appears most consistent with F4 artifact (~8 Hz spikey waveforms <20 msec in duration); this activity resolves after technician replaces F4 electrode.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 110s.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Continuous right hemispheric slowing 3. Tachycardia seen on a single EKG lead.  These findings are consistent with right hemispheric dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Tachycardia is seen on a single EKG lead.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (6/14/2016, 06:00 - 6/14/2016, 08:43)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS:   (1) DATE AND TIME:  6/14/2016 at 08:06 EVENT TYPE: dizziness CLINICAL: Patient complains of dizziness. EEG: No ictal epileptic EEG correlate is present DURATION: ~3 min 20 sec POSTICTAL CHANGES:  none EKG: no change in heart rate from baseline  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in 110s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change. An episode during which the patient felt dizzy was not associated with any EEG or EKG changes.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Continuous right hemispheric slowing 3. Tachycardia seen on a single EKG lead. 4. An episode on 6/14/2016 during which the patient felt dizzy, which was not associated with any EEG or EKG changes   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are consistent with right hemispheric dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Tachycardia is seen on a single EKG lead. The episode of dizziness on 6/14 was not associated with EEG or EKG changes and is unlikely to represent seizure activity.
