TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
 technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.  The
patient had multiple clinical events, as many as 2 per hour but was not pushing the button



_____________________________

Day 1 May 4-5, 206

Medicines: PHENYTOIN, ATIVAN, PHENOBARBITAL, KEPPRA


EEG BACKGROUND/ INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by an asymmetry.  The left hemisphere is somewhat slow in
the theta frequency background and scant posterior dominant rhythm.


The right hemisphere demonstrates a breach rhythm.  In addition, there is focal slowing with
arrhythmic mixed theta delta.

During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements,  and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by a theta/delta pattern with continuous or nearly continuous arrhythmic delta
activity in the right central parietal region.  Breach rhythm is noted scant vertex waves are seen.
During the record, asymmetric stage II sleep was noted with breach rhythm




Moderate Generalized slowing is present.

Focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare C4 sharp




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None

SEIZURES/EVENTS:


There are  clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

6:45, 8:24, 9:16 and 10:44 PM. Not clear if patient was aware of them.  The electrographic pattern is
similar to that noted in the baseline study: Rhythmic R central parietal theta evolves into alpha beta
frequency activity, then theta. It ends abruptly.  He is unable to move his left arm during the
discharges.  He seems to answer questions slowly but does follow commands.



Seizures seem to occur exclusively in wakefulness.


EKG: A single lead captured HR 120 BPM

DAY 2 (May 5, 06:00 - 5/06/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: PHENYTOIN, ATIVAN, PHENOBARBITAL, KEPPRA



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

The overall background is of normal, diffusely slow, overall a theta frequency pattern with scant L4
rhythm.  There is an asymmetry with more focal slowing from the right hemisphere, right frontocentral
breach.  Of note, the asymmetry is not as remarkable as day one.




Sleep is characterized by increase in delta


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Rare (<1hour) C4


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile and verbal stimulation identified awake pattern


SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are subtle electrographic events captured during this study.




There are brief bursts of rhythmic theta frequency activity noted from the right central region without
clear clinical correlation



EKG: A single lead captured HR 90 BPM

-----------------------------------------------------------------


FINAL IMPRESSION:



This is abnormal video EEG due to:



1. initially, multiple electrographic seizures identified from right frontocentral region with some
impairment in response time, and perhaps also increasing left-sided weakness

2. right focal slowing, improving as the seizures improved


3. generalized background slowing, also improving over the course of the record but not resolved by
the end




FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are suggestive of not only a focal mechanism for epilepsy but a structural process,
concurrent with clinical history and imaging
