HISTORY:

53 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy and developmental delay.  Usually seizure-
free, recurrent seizures today, associated hyponatremia referred for routine EEG for characterization
of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

TEGRETOL 200 mg tablet,


DEPAKOTE 500 mg EC tablet, TAKE 2 TABLETS PO BID

DEPAKOTE 250 mg EC tablet, TK 1 T PO BID



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:




A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.  The patient is extremely sleepy




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is limited, what is characterized by the presence of a  symmetric mixture of
alpha and Theta frequencies, without well defined  a symmetric and reactive *posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
There is a great deal of muscle artifact in wakefulness.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by low-voltage vertex waves



Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile and verbal stimulation produced no learning response but
when awake, the wake background is subsequent by muscle


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. generalized background slowing


2. relatively low-voltage pattern and sleep


CLINICAL CORRELATION:




This post ictal study did not identify epileptiform activity.  The background slowing may be part of
this patient's diffuse cerebral process or postictal state.  Metabolic factors may also play a role a
repeat study, when the patient is back to baseline may be helpful to identify epileptiform activity
