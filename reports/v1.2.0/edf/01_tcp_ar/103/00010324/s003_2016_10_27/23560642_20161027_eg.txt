HISTORY: 53 y.o. male with a history of seizures and cognitive impairment, now presents after 2 breakthrough seizures.    MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: clonazepam (KLONOPIN) tablet 0.5 mg carbamazepine (TEGRETOL) tablet 200 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg Lorazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion Lorazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg carbamazepine (TEGRETOL) tablet 300 mg carbamazepine (TEGRETOL) tablet 200 mg carbamazepine (TEGRETOL) tablet 300 mg divalproex (DEPAKOTE DR) tablet 750 mg    SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  EEG BACKGROUND: Patient is asleep throughout nearly the entire study.  The technologist is unable to keep the patient awake.  During the ~30 seconds of arousal, the background consists of diffuse fast activity.  Sleep consists of a mixture of theta, delta and sleep spindles.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.       Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.       Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.   EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an unremarkable nearly entirely asleep portable 21 minute EEG.  CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
