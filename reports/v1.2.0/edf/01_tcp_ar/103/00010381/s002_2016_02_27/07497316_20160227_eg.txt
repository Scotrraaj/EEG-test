CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 43-year-old woman of unknown handedness with

past history of PML, admitted with intermittent episodes of


tremulousness and eye deviation, evaluated for stroke.


MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and others.



INTRODUCTION:  A 1.5 hour digital video EEG was performed at

bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement


with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was observed for an extended

period of time in hopes that the patient would fall asleep or

tremulousness would resolve.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This 1.5 hour EEG, the majority of

the record includes a medium amplitude pattern with muscle twitch


artifact.  The glimpse of the background EEG suggests there is

background slowing.



When observed, the patient is noted to have tremulousness, but




when unobserved, the tremulousness stops.  Therefore, an extended

record was completed.  Despite this as well as the use of Ativan,


the patient had persistent tremulousness.  There is a brief

section of the record of better quality recording with dropout of


muscle and a glimpse of a slow background.  Although, by this

point, there is some electrode artifact, there is a question of

sharp waves noted from the left frontotemporal region.



Heart rate 106 bpm.



IMPRESSION:  Technically limited EEG, but remarkable for:

1. Excess muscle artifact.

2. Low voltage, probably somewhat slow pattern.

3. Question of underlying sharp waves noted from the left, but


with double phase reversing artifact.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  When this patient is more cooperative, a

repeat study can be attempted.  Previous EEGs have demonstrated

left temporal sharp waves and TIRDA.
