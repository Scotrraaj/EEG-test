HISTORY:

43 y.o. FEMALE CC OF RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS

AND CONFUSION.  PMHX: HIV, SEIZURES.  PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL


LEUOENCEPHALOPATHY.


MEDICATIONS


ZOSYN, METOPROLOL, HALDOL, LOVENOX, ASA, KEPPRA, ATROVASTATIN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record due to

diffuse muscle artifact seen during large part of the study and


included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

mixture of low amplitude delta frequencies. There is no posterior


dominant rhythm (PDR). Diffuse superimposed excess beta is seen.

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient is absent.


Some sleep features are seen with synchronous and symmetric


vertex waves and asymmetric sleep spindles best seen on the

right.


Slow wave sleep was not captured.


Continuous focal slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies is

seen over the left hemisphere maximally over the left anterior


temporal region.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Quasi- periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges are seen

continuously on the left anterior temporal at 0.9 Hz.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Quasi-PLEDs left anterior temporal


2. Continuous focal slowing and attenuation over the left

hemisphere maximal in the anterior temporal region.


3. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of a focal structural

irritable cortical lesion in the left anterior temporal region.

This lesion is potentially epileptogenic but no seizures were


seen. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the

medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
