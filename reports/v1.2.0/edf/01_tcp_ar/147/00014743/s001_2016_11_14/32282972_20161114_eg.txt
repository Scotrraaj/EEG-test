HISTORY:

37 y.o. female with a history of white matter changes in MRI and shaking spells in
sleep,  referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

mometasone (ELOCON) 0.1 % lotion, Apply to AA on scalp daily

ketoconazole (NIZORAL) 2 % shampoo, Apply to scalp, leave 5 mins, rinse 2x/week


ketoconazole (NIZORAL) 2 % cream, Apply to face BID x 4 weeks PRN flare

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 600 mg tablet,

Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, (VITAMIN D) 1,000 unit Tablet, Take 1,000 Units by mouth daily.


Ceramides 1,3,6-11 (CERAVE) Lotion, Cerave, as face moisturizer.

Parab-Cety&Stea Alc-Pro Gl-SLS (PARABEN-CETYL AND STEARYL ALCOHOL-PRO GL-SLS)
Cleanser, Cetaphil cleanser, use to wash face daily.



TECHNIQUE:




A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz  40 uVposterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


In drowsiness, while there several normal variants, there is also subtle, underlying higher amplitude
theta noted in the left mid temporal region.

Sleep is not sustained


No generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Occasional wicket waves are noted during drowsiness over the temporal  regions and Rhythmic mid-
temporal theta of drowsiness noted over the left>right temporal region (rare)



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation: Produces bilateral theta but slightly more so on the left



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a subtly abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1.  Somewhat irregular left temporal theta noted in hyperventilation and drowsiness





CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are subtle, nonspecific and may be correlated with
imaging.  No epileptiform features were identified.  Because nocturnal seizures was an important
consideration, please consider a repeat one hour EEG capturing sleep or, alternatively a sleep
deprived EEG
