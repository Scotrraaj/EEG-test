SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Occasionally superimposed wide complex
extra beats are seen.



IMPRESSION / CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an essentially normal awake only routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected. A single EKG lead is remarkable for wide complex extra beats occasionally
superimposed on the background rhythm, consistent with PVCs.



A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
