SEDATION: as above


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record
due to periods of diffuse muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous and symmetric, but poorly organized. Background consists of mostly
theta and delta frequencies.


There is no posterior dominant rhythm.


In drowsiness and sleep, theta activity becomes attenuated and background consists of mostly delta
and alpha frequencies. Sleep transients are not seen.



There is moderate to severe generalized slowing.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Abundant (>1/10s) diffuse sharp waves with triphasic morphology, frequently periodic at 1 Hz for
periods up to 20 seconds (generalized periodic discharges)



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Abundant sharp waves with triphasic morphology


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.



Periodic diffuse sharp waves with triphasic morphology are a nonspecific but pathologic finding that
have been most often associated with a toxic-metabolic process.  However, a diffuse epileptogenic
process cannot be completely excluded. Clinical correlation advised.




Following this study the patient was continued on long term monitoring for further assessment.
