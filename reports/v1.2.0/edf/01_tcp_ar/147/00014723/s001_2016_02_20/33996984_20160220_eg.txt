HISTORY:

88 Y.O. MALE FOUND DOWN IN HOUSE FIRE 4 DAYS

AG. PT HAS SMOKE INHALATION INJURY TO LUNGS. PT HAS BEEN OFF


SEDATION FOR 24 HOURS, PT NOT FOLLOWING COMMANDS. EEG TO RULE OUT

SZ.



MEDICATIONS:

METOPROLOL, HEPARIN, MORPHINE, FAMOTIDINE, ASA, WELLBUTRIN,

ZOCOR, ZOSYN, ATIVAN, SYTHROID



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a


poorly organized symmetric mixture of theta and delta. With a

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at best reaches 7 Hertz.


Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology


are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms

demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:

1. Triphasic's


2. Mild to moderate diffuse slow




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,

which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic

origin.
