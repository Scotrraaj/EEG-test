HISTORY:

75 y.o. female with PMH stroke followed by seizures, presenting with syncope vs.
seizure, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 500 mg

albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 2.5 mg


aspirin EC tablet 81 mg

carvedilol (COREG) tablet 6.25 mg

clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg


fluticasone-salmeterol (ADVAIR) 250-50 mcg/dose diskus inhaler 1 puff

furosemide (LASIX) tablet 20 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 20 mg


rosuvastatin (CRESTOR) tablet 20 mg

tiotropium (SPIRIVA) inhalation capsule 18 mcg



heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg


insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 5 mg



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
theta, alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7.5 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



Generalized slowing in the theta frequency is present.

Intermittent focal delta slowing is present in bilateral frontal and temporal region, L>R, noted in
wakefulness and early drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Occ PVCs



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:



1. Generalized theta slowing

2. Intermittent focal delta slowing in bilateral frontal and temporal regions



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific in a subject of this age but are commonly seen in ischemic
cerebrovascular disease.  The generalized slowing can be seen in toxic or metabolic encephalopathy
as well
