CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old male, transferred to hospital


from a Behavioral Health Facility after he fell from chair and

sustained laceration.  Past history of depression, anxiety, and

stroke, but limited details available.




INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at bedside in

ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one


channel EKG.  Tactile and auditory stimulation were performed.

The patient was intubated and unresponsive.




DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is diffusely slow and

low voltage, relatively featureless.  There are minor asymmetries

noted in the frontal regions, compatible with alteration in


electrode placement due to the patient's scalp laceration.

Ventilator and other ICU artifacts are noted, but there is some

beta activity noted at the midline.  During the EEG, the


patient's fentanyl was discontinued.  This did not significantly

activate the record.  Tactile stimulation of the record produced

some bursts of frontal delta.







Heart rate:  111 bpm.




IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but markedly abnormal EEG

due to marked background slowing.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings must be placed in the

appropriate clinical context with this patient's other

comorbidities and findings.  When the fentanyl was held, there


was some reactivity to external stimuli.  No definitive

epileptiform features were noted in this record.
