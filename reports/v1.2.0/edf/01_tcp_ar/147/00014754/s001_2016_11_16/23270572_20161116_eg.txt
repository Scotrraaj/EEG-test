SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse mainly
theta and some delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




Sleep is not captured but state changes are noted.



Moderate generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:




She exhibit facial twitching with no EEG correlate



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



1. Moderate diffuse slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.



No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
