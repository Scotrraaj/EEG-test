HISTORY:

33 y.o. female with a history of lightheadedness after PCP ingestion referred for
routine EEG for characterization of paroxysmal events. Follow up EEG.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

acetaminophen-codeine (TYLENOL #3) 300-30 mg per tablet,

cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) 10 mg tablet,


amoxicillin (AMOXIL) 500 mg capsule,

chlorhexidine (PERIDEX) 0.12 % solution,

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 600 mg tablet, Take 600 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for Pain.



No AEDs



TECHNIQUE:





A 1-hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International
10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11.2 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, there is marked slowing of the alpha rhythm and increased in amplitude of the
alpha and hypnogogic hypersynchrony. Wicket is also seen.



Deeper stages of sleep are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Occasional wicket waves are noted during drowsiness over the temporal regions



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: rhythmic slowing


Photic Stimulation: gives a driving response



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:




This is an normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.

1. Wicket and hypogognic hypersynchrony are normal variants.
