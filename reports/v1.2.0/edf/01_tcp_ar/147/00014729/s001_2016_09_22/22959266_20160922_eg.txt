HISTORY:


25 y.o. female with a history of recent spell out of sleep with kicking in bed,
tongue biting, then failure to recognize family.  referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal
events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

amoxicillin (AMOXIL) 500 mg capsule, take 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days

SLEEP AID, DOXYLAMINE, 25 mg Tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth at bedtime if needed for insomnia


ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 600 mg tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours if needed for pain

Albuterol (PROVENTIL,VENTOLIN) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every 6
hours as needed.


fluticasone (FLOVENT DISKUS) 50 mcg/actuation diskus inhaler, Inhale 1 puff into the lungs 2 times
daily.


CONDOMS, NON-LATEX, LUBRICATED (CONDOMS - MALE) Misc, Use as indicated

Tuberculin PPD Diagnostic Test, Inject  into the skin. As directed




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.





SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive10.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric
photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
