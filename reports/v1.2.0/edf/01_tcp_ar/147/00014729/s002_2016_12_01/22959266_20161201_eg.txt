HISTORY:

25 y.o. female with a history of new onset TC seizures referred for routine EEG
for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

amoxicillin (AMOXIL) 500 mg capsule, take 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days

SLEEP AID, DOXYLAMINE, 25 mg Tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth at bedtime if needed for insomnia


ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 600 mg tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours if needed for pain


lTECHNIQUE:


A  1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not achieved


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: elicits a driving response



EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE: A heart rate of 66-90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Irregular



IMPRESSION:

This routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This routine EEG was remarkable only on irregular heart rate. .
