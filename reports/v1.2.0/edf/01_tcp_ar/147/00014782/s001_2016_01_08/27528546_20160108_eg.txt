History:	64 year old man who presents with subacute change in mental status.  Patient 
	underwent a lung transplant in 9/2015.
Medications:	cyclosporine, azathioprine, acyclovir, klonopin, trazadone
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of low-to-moderate 
amplitude theta and delta activity and intermittent broadly based triphasic waveforms.  Patient 
remains awake throughout the recording.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
	No epileptiform discharges
	Triphasic waves, intermittent
	No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 22-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and triphasic 
waveforms. These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy, which is 
etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.  Triphasic waves are a nonspecific 
EEG finding that can be seen in hepatic encephalopathy, uremia and anoxia.
