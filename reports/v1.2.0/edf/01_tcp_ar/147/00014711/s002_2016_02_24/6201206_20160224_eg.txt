SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

During maximal arousal, the posterior dominant rhythm consists of


8 Hz low amplitude theta activity, weak AP gradient and excess

polymorphic theta activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy,


diffuse underriding slow theta and delta activity appears.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A regular heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


Diffuse slowing - mild-to-moderate

No stage II sleep


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy portable EEG due to

mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing.


This finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral

dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.


The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not

rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
