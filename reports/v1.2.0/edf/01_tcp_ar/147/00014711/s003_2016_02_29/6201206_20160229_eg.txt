HISTORY:

90 y.o. FEMALE P/W INTERMITTENT SLURRED SPEECH

AND DISORIENTED LASTING 1 HR. PMH: ASTHMA, HTN, DM, DEMENTIA,


TIA. LAST TUESDAY PT WAS SAID TO HAVE A SEIZURE FOAMNG FROM MOUTH

MOVING MOUTH.  56 CM HEAD DAUGHTER SAYS HER MOTHER HAD STROKE.



MEDICATIONS:

CIPROFLOXACIN, METFORMIN, CLOPIDOGREL



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



Intermittent focal slowing seen independently in the left more

than right anterior temporal region.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Intermittent focal slowing seen independently in the left more


than right anterior temporal region.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of focal cerebral


dysfunction in those regions, which is non-specific with regards

to etiology.
