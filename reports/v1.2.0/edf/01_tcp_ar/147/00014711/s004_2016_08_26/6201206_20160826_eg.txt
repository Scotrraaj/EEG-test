HISTORY:

91 y.o. female with a history of seizures, HTN, DM, asthma who presented with a
seizure and hypertensive urgency in setting of noncompliance, referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS: TRILEPTAL, INSULIN, LOVENOX, ZOFRAN, COZAAR, ARICEPT, SINGULAIR,
LIPITOR, PLAVIX, COREG.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

Most of the study consists of sleep. Sleep is characterized by diffuse background slowing with delta
and theta activity. Rudimentary sleep spindles are noted.




The background briefly reacts when the patient is roused by the technician. At this time, the
background consists of diffuse disorganized theta without a clear posterior dominant rhythm. The
patient quickly falls back asleep.




Moderate generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction,
which may at least in part be due to an excessively drowsy state.
