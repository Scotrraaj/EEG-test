SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG but no HV and no photic


stimulation.  Patient seems to have oral dyskinesias producing

muscle artifact



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 7 to 8.3

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.  The waking background


demonstrates mild, diffuse background theta



During limited drowsiness: There is dropout of muscle activity,

presence of slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.





Mild generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is

present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to mild background slowing


There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or

detected.  No epileptiform features were seen



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are unremarkable in an adult of this age.

This routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.
