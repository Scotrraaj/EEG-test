HISTORY:

68 y.o. MALE S/P BILATERAL LUNG TRANSPLANT 8

DAYS AGO.  1/20 CODED > 30MIN -> ECMO. 1/24 STROKE ALERT NOT


MOVING LEFT SIDE AND GAZE DEVIATED UPWARD.


CTH: B/L OCCIPITAL LOBE INFARCTS R>L


RIGHT FRONTAL LOBE INFARCT


PMH: COPD AND EMPHYSEMA



MEDICATIONS:

NYSTATIN, SODIUM CHLORIDE, ACROSOLZED, METRONIDAZLE, HEPARIN,


LISPRO, PROGRAF


SEDATION: None






TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.


EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity

with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of


frequencies.


Diffuse, posterior maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology

are present at 1-2Hz throughout the recording.  These waveforms


demonstrate a phase lag.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not

performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Posterior triphasics

2. Diffuse slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal routine EEG due to frequent posterior-maximal

triphasic waves and severe diffuse background slowing.  These


findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which

is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic

origin.
