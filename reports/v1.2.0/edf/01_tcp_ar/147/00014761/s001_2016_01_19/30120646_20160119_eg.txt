HISTORY:

68 y.o. male with a history of severe COPD,

s/p lung transplant referred for routine EEG for assessment of


mental status change.


MEDICATIONS / SEDATION: propofol, epinephrine, insulin, vasocv;


but tech notes


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous and symmetric but consists of




disorganized delta with attenuated faster frequencies.

Spontaneous mouth movements and body shifting movements are noted


by the tech.  There is no clear change in EEG cerebral activity

during these movements.  There is no reactivity, variability, or


state change.


Severe generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing with background disorganization and


lack of reactivity


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral


dysfunction.
