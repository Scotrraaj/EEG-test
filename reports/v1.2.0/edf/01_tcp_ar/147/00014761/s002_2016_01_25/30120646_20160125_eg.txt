HISTORY:

68 y.o. S/P BILATERAL LUNG TRANSPLANT 8 DAYS

AGO.


1/20 CODED > 30MIN -> ECMO 1/24 STROKE ALERT NOT MOVING LEFT SIDE

AND GAZE DEVIATED UPWARD.

CTH: B/L OCCIPITAL LOBE INFARCTS R>L


RIGHT FRONTAL LOBE INFARCT

PMH: COPD AND EMPHYSEMA




MEDICATIONS:

Fentanyl



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:




A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due to ICU

artifacts and included a single channel of EKG and photic


stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is continuous and symmetric but consists of


disorganized delta with attenuated faster frequencies.

Spontaneous mouth movements are seen.  There is no clear change


in EEG cerebral activity during these movements.  There is

minimal variability with stimulation. However the is mainly due

to a diffuse myogenic artifact.



Severe generalized slowing is present.



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:


1. Severe generalized slowing with background disorganization.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral


dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology.
