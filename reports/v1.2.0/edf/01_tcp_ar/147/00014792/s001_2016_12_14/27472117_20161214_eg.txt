HISTORY:

72 y.o. male with a history of lung cancer, we will onset refractory epilepsy with
complex partial semiology referred for routine EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA)

heparin 25,000 units (100 units/mL) in 0.45% sodium chloride 250 mL infusion (Premix)


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 10 mg

digoxin (LANOXIN) tablet 250 mcg

diltiazem (CARDIZEM CD) 24 hr capsule 240 mg


LORazepam (ATIVAN) tablet 0.5 mg

metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 24 hr tablet 100 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg


ondansetron (ZOFRAN) tablet 8 mg

oxyCODONE (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 10 mg



sTECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal  stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
theta and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Moderate generalized slowing is present.

Shifting temporal focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile stimulation does not particularly change the EEG

EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


An irregular  heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderately diffusely slow background



CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to a previous study.  The background slowing
in this context is nonspecific and medications may play a role.  No epileptiform features were
identified in this EEG however.  Continues video EEG monitoring and will follow the study
