SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a symmetric diffuse theta frequencies,
with a 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient is absent.



Sleep is not captured



Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left more than right anterior temporal regions
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None






ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

An irregular heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Intermittent focal slowing in the left more than right anterior temporal regions


2. Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.

3. Irregular heart rate.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the left more
than right anterior temporal regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific. In addition there is mild to moderate diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
