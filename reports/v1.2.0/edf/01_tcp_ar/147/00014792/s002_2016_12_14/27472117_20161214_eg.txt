SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

Continuous 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and O2 monitor. Seizure and spike detection software





DAY 1 (12/14/2016 - 12/15/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND:

The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric,  Fairly well-organized, and consists predominantly
of theta with admixed alpha and beta.



Posterior dominant rhythm was present but slowed, 6.5-7.5 Hz.



The background is  reactive,  Variable.



There were intermittent  asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Shifting slowing, L>R, particularly
L posterior temporal



Sleep was limited but characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric
vertex waves

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


EVENTS: None






EKG: A single lead captured HR 90-110 BPM irregular



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:


Primarily generalized slowing, without prominent left anterior temporal slow and paucity of
epileptiform activity

-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 2 (12/15/2015, 06:00 - 12/16/2016, 06:00)




BACKGROUND: No change


GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change



FOCAL SLOWING: No change



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured  90 BPM




DAY  2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


Generalized slowing, no seizures.  Medicine adjustment continues.

-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 3 (12/16/2016,, 06:00 - 12/17/2016, 06:00)




AEDs: Lacosamide, Keppra reduction



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is  symmetric and reaches 7
Hz. overall background continues to demonstrate excess theta


Sleep is fragmented, includes vertex waves and spindles.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: limited biking did not elicit clinical symptoms



SEIZURES/EVENTS:There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


EKG: A single lead captured 80-117 BPM irregular-

EVENTS:


6 minute bedside bike:

8:50 AM- patient was awake.  Unfortunately, EEG electrodes were not in good quality at that time
but, there was no change in the EEG and the patient did not have any clinical symptoms


No other  clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured 90 BPM irregular


DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION and overall clinical correlation


The background EEG for this adult with lung cancer and polypharmacy is slow with excess theta.

In contrast to previous EEGs, there were no epileptiform discharges

There is minor, shifting temporal slowing but no sustained focal slowing.


Medication reduction, reducing the dose of Keppra, for this adult who had been experiencing
seizures almost every other day, was not successful in producing a seizure.

On 2 occasions, the patient was given physical exercise, using the bedside bicycle.  He remained
hemodynamically stable, was not hypoxic and did not experience any events.




At present, the conclusion from this EEG monitor is that the patient has an abnormal background.
The use of lower dose Vimpat, initially 50 mg and then 100 mg twice a day seems to have been
effective in stopping his seizures and he was discharged home after being treated with the  Target
Vimpat dose for more than 48 hours
