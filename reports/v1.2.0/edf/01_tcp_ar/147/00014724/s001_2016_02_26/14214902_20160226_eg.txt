HISTORY:

36 y.o. male with a history of hypertensive

encephalopathy with new onset seizure and possible volume


overload referred for routine EEG for characterization of

seizures.



MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Topamax


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a


fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha, theta, and beta

frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 6.5-7 Hertz posterior


dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient

of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, bursts of delta

waves shifting between the hemispheres, and further background


slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse

cerebral dysfunction.
