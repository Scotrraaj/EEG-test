History:	80 year old woman with episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	no AEDs listed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left posterior temporal region. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps} induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates. A single EKG lead demonstrates irregular heart rate.

Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild, left temporal, posterior No epileptiform discharges
Cardiac arrhythmia
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the left posteropr temporal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin. A single EKG lead demonstrates irregular heart rate.
