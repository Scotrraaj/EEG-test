SEDATION:


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.

Craniotomy defects were noted.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by a diffuse, low to


medium amplitude 6 Hz theta pattern.  There is scant underlying

delta noted in the background.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, are accompanied by

relatively little change in the overall EEG



Sleep is not captured



Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

The context of her breach rhythm, there are occasional left


temporal sharp waves noted.  These are broadly contoured with a

generous field of spread in the temporal region.  In addition,

there is 11 Hz activity noted from the left hemisphere with a

wide field of spread involving C3, P3, T5.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Not performed



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. background slowing with a relatively monotonous 6-7 Hz theta

background.


2. sharp waves from the left hemisphere with variable

morphologies.  Some have more of a typical broad contour.  Others


are more characteristic of a discharge in context of  breach with

a


high amplitude 11 Hz discharge pair of  Discharges


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function


as well as potentially a focal mechanism for seizures.  Previous

EEGs are not available for comparison.  EEG monitoring will


follow this study
