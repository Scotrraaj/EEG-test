SEDATION: none

TECHNIQUE:

Continuous video EEG electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and seizure and spike detection

software.

Craniotomy defects were noted.

DAY 1 (03/03/2016 - 3/4/2016)

EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by a diffuse, low to

medium amplitude 6 Hz theta pattern. There is scant underlying


delta noted in the background.

During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, are accompanied by


relatively little change in the overall EEG


Sleep is captured and include spiky vertex waves, some of which

are asymmetric, may be maximum on left or right


GENERALIZED SLOWING

Generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

In the context of  breach rhythm, there are occasional left


temporal sharp waves noted. These are broadly contoured with a

generous field of spread in the temporal region. In addition,


there is 11 Hz activity noted from the left hemisphere with a

wide field of spread involving C3, P3, T5.

Addition to normal vertex sleep waves, there are also some

isolated spikes at C4, in the context of breach rhythm, and pairs


of C4 11 Hz discharges



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Not performed



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal LTM EEG due to:

1. background slowing with a relatively monotonous 6-7 Hz theta

background.

2. sharp waves from the left hemisphere with variable


morphologies. Some have more of a typical broad contour. Others

are more characteristic of a discharge  in context of breach with


a

high amplitude 11 Hz discharge pair of Discharges

3. Sharp waves or spiky vertex or asymmetric C4 spikes in sleep

from the right


4. Infrequent T 3 sharp waves



Impression/Clinical correlation:

The  clinical symptoms of staring with dilated pupils have not

been recorded.

No electrographic seizures were noted.


The patient seems to sleep poorly at night and generally

demonstrates psychomotor slowing but not the symptoms that the


mother is concerned about.



-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 2(03/04, 06:00 - 3/05/2016, 06:00)



AEDs:divalproex (DEPAKOTE)- with modest dose reduction


levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, two tablets in the

morning and one tablet at night.


lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 150 mg tablet,  2

times daily.


Technical note: patient taken to CT scan.  Briefly A2 and T4

electrodes were switched. This section has some electrode

artifacts, but the epileptiform activity is discernable

INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by a diffuse, low to

medium amplitude 6 Hz theta pattern. There is scant underlying


delta noted in the background.

During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, are accompanied by

relatively little change in the overall EEG

The patient is awake during  the night.



Sleep: Sleep is captured and include spiky vertex waves, some of


which

are asymmetric, may be maximum on left or right


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


In the context of  breach rhythm, there are occasional left

temporal sharp waves noted. These are broadly contoured with a


generous field of spread in the temporal region. In addition,

there is 11 Hz activity noted from the left hemisphere with a

wide field of spread involving C3, P3, T5.

In addition to normal vertex sleep waves, there are also some


isolated spikes at C4, in the context of breach rhythm, and pairs

of C4 11 Hz discharge.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: With PT and Nursing, the patient was

gotten out of bed, in hopes of capturing a staring spell No


impact on EEG.




SEIZURES/EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



EKG: A single lead captured HR 60 BPM



DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal LTM EEG due to:

1. background slowing with a relatively monotonous 6-7 Hz theta


background.

2. sharp waves from the left hemisphere with variable


morphologies. Some have more of a typical broad contour. Others

are more characteristic of a discharge in context of  breach with

a

high amplitude 11 Hz discharge pair of Discharges


3. Sharp waves or spiky vertex or asymmetric C4 spikes in sleep

from the right


4. Infrequent T 3 sharp waves

5. Low voltage C3 beta brief bursts, not sustained.


Clinical update:


The  clinical symptoms of staring with dilated pupils have not

been recorded.


No electrographic seizures were noted.

The patient seems to sleep poorly at night and is slow to get out

of bed in the morning.

morning and one tablet at night. lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 150 mg

tablet,  2 daily.



Technical note:  that T5 and T6 electrodes were switched.


Despite this,  electrode artifacts, t the epileptiform activity

is discernable



BACKGROUND: No change


GENERALIZED SLOWING: Not significantly changed, perhaps a little


more alert with a little more faster frequency activity



FOCAL SLOWING: No change


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTFORM ACTIVITY: Despite the limitations described

above, left temporal sharp waves and sharply contoured slowing


was accompanied by lower voltage bursts of either a 11 Hz

activity in the central regions or C3 brief beta buzz


EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured 78



DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

The  clinical symptoms of staring with dilated pupils have not

been recorded.


No electrographic seizures were noted.

The patient seems to sleep poorly at night and is slow to get out


of bed in the morning.






-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 4 (03/06/2016, 06:00 - 3/07/2016, 06:00)


AEDs:divalproex (DEPAKOTE)- with modest dose reduction

levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, two tablets in the


morning and one tablet at night. lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 150 mg

tablet,  2 daily.



Activation methods:

The bedside team continued to work to get the patient out of bed

to chair and to ambulate more vigorously.



BACKGROUND: In comparison to the previous days, and the EEG


remains markedly slow.  There is no well-defined posterior

dominant rhythm.  Shifting frontal slowing and breach rhythm can

be identified.  Sleep was more sustained in the evening hours

with evidence of stage II sleep and spindles



GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change



FOCAL SLOWING: No change.


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY In the context of  breach


rhythm,occasional left

temporal sharp waves noted. These are broadly contoured with a

generous field of spread in the temporal region.

Most epileptiform activity is seen in the sleep in this section


of the record In addition,

there is 11 Hz activity noted from the left hemisphere with a


wide field of spread involving C3, P3,

In Addition to normal vertex sleep waves, there are also some

isolated spikes at C4, in the context of breach rhythm, may occur

in pairs



No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 90  BPM



DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



No seizures were recorded.


The overall background remains markedly abnormal.

The patient seems to be sleeping more consistently at night, but

none of the behaviors in question have yet been recorded.

Complex epileptiform activity is identified including left


temporal and independent or bilateral frontocentral activity.

In this section of the record, most epileptiform activity is in


sleep.
