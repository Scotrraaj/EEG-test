HISTORY:


116 y.o. male with a history of right basal ganglia hematoma, with mass effect,
s/p ventriculostomy referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.  Patient had
Episode of Right eye deviation.



MEDICATIONS:


SEDATION: propofol


TECHNIQUE:


Continuous  bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded
using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
Â technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.
Seizure and spike detection software was used. The patient is intubated, comatose with prior episode
eye deviation and an EVD at the midline.



Day 1, May 8-9  2016

EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is characterized by the presence of fairly continuous mixture of delta and theta
frequencies. There is little beta seen.  Shifting asymmetries are seen with intermittent attentuation
from either hemisphere.  The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
NOT  present.





Generalized slowing is present.

Modest focal slowing is present, slower and more attentuated on the right, intermittent.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  Tactile stimulation: can elicit  an increase in theta



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

HR: 96 BPM

DAY 2 (05/09/2016 - 5/10/2016, 12:00)


AEDs: propfol



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

The background is characterized by the presence of fairly continuous mixture of delta and theta
frequencies. There is little beta seen.  Shifting asymmetries are seen with intermittent attentuation
from either hemisphere.  The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
NOT  present.



Intermittent, generalized attenuation score noted.

Generalized slowing is present.


Focal slowing is present, slower and more attentuated on the right, intermittent.   At times the right
hemisphere is briefly discontinuous.

There is clear variability noted in the record with some portions of the record more continuous and
vigorous others demonstrating intermittent attenuation as might be seen with adjustment of
anesthetic medications.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

There are rare bursts of sharply contoured slowing from the right hemisphere



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



EKG: A single lead captured HR 80 BPM



-----------------------------------------------------------------


FINAL IMPRESSION:



This is abnormal 48 hour video EEG due to:



1. Marked background slowing

2. Superimposed focal slowing on the right.




FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are suggestive of a bihemispheric process, most notable on the right.  No seizures
were recorded. There were no additional episodes of eye deviation noted.
