DATE OF STUDY: 05/13/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, asleep only





HISTORY:

 a 116 y.o. male with a history of severe ICH with IVH.



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.





The background consists of attenuated slow delta activity and frequent bursts, often asymmetric, of
diffuse polymorphic theta activity.



There is no clear change in the background with stimulation, although minor EMG artifact is seen.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  Patient is tachypneic
throughout the study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of up to 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal comatose 44 minute EEG due to:

1. Moderate -to-severe diffuse background slowing

2. No clear background reactivity.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.
