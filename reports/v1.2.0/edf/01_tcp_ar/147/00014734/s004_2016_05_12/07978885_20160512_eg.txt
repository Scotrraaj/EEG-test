HISTORY:

73 y.o. female with a history of strokes, dementia, now presents with change in
mental status. Impaired receptive speech, intermittently not speaking at all



MEDICATIONS:

Depakote


See extensive medication list.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

Continous Video EEG monitor is performed  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)
was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne
system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. Seizure
and spike detection software was used.




May 11-May 12, 2016


Clinical: by the morning of the 12th, the patient was speaking, and answering questions, but was
hoarse and could not swallow.  Her Creatinine was rising.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.


The background is generally sharply contoured.



The wake background over the right consists of polymorphic occasional 8 Hz theta activity posteriorly,
poor AP gradient and excess polymorphic theta and delta activity.



There is no clear  PDR or AP gradient over the left.

Focal slowing is present.

The background over the left consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity with delta
activity most pronounced over the posterior quadrant.



Sleep is characterized by an increase in slowing, Vertex waves and spindles were identified.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Intermittent sharp waves are captured over the left posterior quadrant (maximal over T5/P3).


2. Occasional independent bisynchronous  occipitally maximal sharp waves are observed.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Diffuse triphasic-like waveforms are present.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic seizures captured.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 70-90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Irregular



IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Day 1 LTM : abnormal awake and drowsy   EEG due to:


1. Mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing

2. Focal left hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the posterior quadrant

3. Intermittent epileptiform discharges over left posterior temporal- parietal region


4.  Epileptiform discharges over the bi-occipital regions

5. Triphasic -like waveforms





May 12-May 13, 2016


EEG BACKGROUND:

There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  However, there
are sections where the asymmetry is not so marked.


The background is generally sharply contoured.

The wake background over the right consists of polymorphic occasional 8 Hz theta activity posteriorly,
poor AP gradient and excess polymorphic theta and delta activity.


There is no clear  PDR or AP gradient over the left.

Focal slowing is present.


The background over the left consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity with delta
activity most pronounced over the posterior quadrant.



Sleep is characterized by an increase in slowing. Vertex waves and spindles were identified.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Intermittent sharp waves are captured over the left posterior quadrant (maximal over T5/P3). These
are less prominent than the baseline or first 23 hours


2. Occasional independent bisynchronous  occipitally maximal sharp waves are observed.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Occasional triphasic-like waveforms are present.

FIRDA



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic seizures captured.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 70-90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Irregular


IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Day 2 LTM : abnormal awake and drowsy   EEG due to:

1. Mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing

2. Focal left hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the posterior quadrant


3. Intermittent epileptiform discharges over left posterior temporal- parietal region



4.  Epileptiform discharges over the bi-occipital regions

5. Triphasic -like waveforms



No seizures were recorded.



-----------------------------------------------------------------


FINAL IMPRESSION:



This is abnormal video EEG due to:



1. Mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing

2. Focal left hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the posterior quadrant, improving over the
course of the record


3. Intermittent epileptiform discharges over left posterior temporal- parietal region

4.  Epileptiform discharges over the bi-occipital regions


5. Triphasic -like waveforms




FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with metabolic encephalopathy.  The focal
features and focal sharp waves may be correlated with imaging for this patient with advanced
cerebrovascular disease.  Over the course of the 2 day video EEG, her communication skills improved
and no seizures were recorded. The background on the left may have improved somewhat.
