History:	84 year old man with a recent episode concerning for a seizure.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
During maximal arousal the background consists of 9 Hz moderate ampliude well formed PDR, 
unstable AP gradient and excess diffuse polymorphic theta activity.  Patient rapidly transitions in 
and out of drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background is replaced by diffuse, most pronounced 
bitemporally, left>>right, semi-rhythmic fast delta activity.
Frequent polymorphic and semi-rhythmic moderate-to-high amplitude delta activity is captured 
over the left temporal region.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  An irregular heart rate is noted on a 
single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, moderate, bilateral (L>R) temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy portable 21-minute EEG due to (1) mild diffuse slowing 
and (2) bitemporal, left>>right, focal slowing, that is often semi-rhythmic, and most pronounced 
during drowsiness. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is 
etiologically nonspecific, but in this patient could be related to an excessively drowsy patient, given
 the fact that he rapidly transitions in-and-out of drowsiness.  Focal slowing indicates focal cerebral 
dysfunction, suggestive of a structural etiology (especially over the left temporal region).  An 
irregular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
