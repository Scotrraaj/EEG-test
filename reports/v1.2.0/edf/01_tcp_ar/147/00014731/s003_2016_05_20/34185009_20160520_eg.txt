DATE OF STUDY: 05/20/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 40 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy, admitted with intoxication and developed
facial twitching referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Levofloxain, Vancomycin, Tylenol, Lovenox, Protonix, Depacon, ativan






TECHNIQUE:

A bedside  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is asymmetric, mixed frequency pattern Rich in theta.  Intermittent delta is
noted.  Arousals or stimulation produced an increase in rhythmic theta and alpha but wakefulness is
not sustained





Stage II sleep is characterized by spindles

Generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: See above

EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. generalized background slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or other
diffuse disorder


No epileptiform features were identified
