HISTORY:

40 y.o. male with a history of drug overdose and decreased responsiveness, now
with episodes of right facial twitching and right hand/ thumb twitching.




MEDICATIONS:


Precedex

Ativan




SEDATION: precedex and ativan



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no clear PDR or AP gradient.  But with stimulation/ during arousals, the background consists
of low amplitude 8-10 Hz activity posteriorly and diffuse slow delta activity.  During periods of
quiescence, the background consists of attenuated slow delta activity with subtle bursts of low
amplitude sleep-spindle like activity.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


An event of right facial twitching and right thumb twitching is captured.  It is reported by the EEG
tech but is not clearly visible on the video.  No abnormal ictal activity is associated with the episode.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~100 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep portable routine EEG due to:

1. Mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding is indicative of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.




An event of right facial twitching and right thumb twitching is not associated with an abnormal ictal
correlate.  Of note, only ~25% of simple partial seizures are captured on a surface EEG.
