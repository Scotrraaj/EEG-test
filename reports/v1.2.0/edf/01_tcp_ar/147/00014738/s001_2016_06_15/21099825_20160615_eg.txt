HISTORY:

52 y.o. male with a history of a recent fall, concerning for a seizure.  Patient also
has a history of a traumatic brain injury and alcohol use.





MEDICATIONS:

Ativan, librium




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by diffuse low amplitude beta activity.



During drowsiness, there is decrease in the background voltages diffusely.



Sleep is not captured


Subtle excess beta activity is noted over the right frontocentral region.  Additionally, subtle
polymorphic theta activity is noted over the right frontocentral region during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Subtle occasional mild right frontocentral focal slowing that is noted during drowsiness

2. No stage II sleep

3. No epileptiform discharges


4. Excess beta activity


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

Subtle occasional mild right frontocentral focal slowing that is noted during drowsiness.



This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly
structural in origin.


Breach effect is secondary to the skull defect.

Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
