HISTORY:

56 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy, but unable to provide many details
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


budesonide-formoterol (SYMBICORT) 160-4.5 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs 2
times daily.


tiotropium (SPIRIVA WITH HANDIHALER) 18 mcg inhalation capsule, Inhale 1 capsule into the lungs
daily.

albuterol (VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every 6 hours as
needed for Wheezing.


ASA,DIPHENHYDRAMINE,


ATRIPLA,

GABAPENTIN,LAMICTAL,SEROQUEL,

PROMETHAZINE,


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  Patient seems to be exceptionally
drowsy.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  There is abundant beta activity
in stage II sleep.  The overall shape of stage II sleep waveforms is very spiky



No generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Photic Stimulation: The patient was unable to stay awake during photic stimulation, there was
minimal driving



EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Regular





IMPRESSION:


This is a normal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. the patient seems to be exceptionally drowsy



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

No epileptiform findings were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consider a more prolonged EEG
