HISTORY:

22 y.o. male with a history of TBI 2/2 MVA in Feb 2015 s/p left
hemicraniectomy and cranioplasty, referred for routine EEG for neurological assessment.



MEDICATIONS:


No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of continuous delta activity on the left in the
context of a sharply contoured breach rhythm. There is a variable 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR) on the R>L. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is preserved
on the right.




During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen. Sleep is not captured.


Focal slowing in the delta range is present on the left side.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.


EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE: A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:

1. Focal delta slowing on the left



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with gray matter changes due to traumatic brain
injury and craniectomy.


The high amplitude delta activity is compatible with a breach rhythm on the left.
