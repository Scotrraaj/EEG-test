HISTORY:

49 YR FEMALE S/P LIVER TX. CC OF PATIENT STOPPED TALKING.
THEN PATIENT HAD EPISODE OF SHAKING 1-2 MIN. GIVEN 2 MG. ATIVAN PT AWAKE
THROUGHOUT EPISODE.


MEDICATIONS:


Keppra

ativan




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at
best reached 8 Hertz . The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present.  Excessive theta in wakefulness is seen.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Mild diffuse slow waves and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to mild diffuse slow waves and
disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
