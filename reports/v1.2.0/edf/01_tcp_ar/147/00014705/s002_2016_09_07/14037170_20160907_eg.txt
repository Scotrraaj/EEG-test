SEDATION: Ativan drip, discontinued prior to study.


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel portable electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded at the bedside using
the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


Background activity consists of a large amount of low to medium amplitude poorly organized 6-7 Hz
activity, most prominent over central, temporal and posterior scalp regions. Low voltage anteriorly
predominant beta activity was seen. Large amounts of intermittent muscle, movement and frontal
eye blink artifact were seen.




During periods of increased drowsiness, attenuation of muscle artifact and increased diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 65 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized background slowing and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a mild to moderate bihemispheric functional disturbance
such as that seen with a variety of generalized encephalopathies of various etiologies. No persistent
focal slowing, no clinical or electrographic seizures and no pathologic paroxysmal epileptiform
discharges were recorded.
