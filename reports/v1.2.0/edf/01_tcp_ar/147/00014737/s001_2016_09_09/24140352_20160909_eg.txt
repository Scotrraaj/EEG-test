HISTORY:

26 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy, recent breakthrough seizure with aura of deja
vu referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 25 mg tablet, Wk 1: 25 mg qhs; Wk 2: 25 mg q12h; Wk 3: 25 mg in AM and
50 mg in PM; Wk 4: 50 mg q12h


oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times
daily as needed for Pain.




TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with, POSTS synchronous and symmetric vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.  Limited Slow wave sleep was captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving,  And supraharmonic driving which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.




A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
