History:	68 year old man with episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
During maximal arousal the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 9 Hz alpha activity.  The expected 
AP gradient is present.  Mild excess of underriding theta and delta activity is present during 
wakefulness.  Patient very rapidly transitions into stage II sleep.  Sleep architecture is symmetrical.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates 
widened QRS complexes, irregular heart rate and frequent premature QRS complexes.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
	Sleep, stage 2
	Cardiac arrhythmia
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding 
is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  However, in this
 patient could be related to excessive drowsiness.  Very rapid transitions from wakefulness to stage II
 sleep are suggestive of an extreme sleep deprivation or an underlying sleep disorder - please 
correlate clinically.  A single EKG lead demonstrates widened QRS complexes, irregular heart rate 
and frequent premature QRS complexes.
