START DATE OF STUDY: 01/05/17 at 10:23 END DATE OF STUDY: 01/06/17 at 13:58  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 75 y.o. female with a history of R ICH s/p craniotomy (no bone flap on R side), referred for continuous long term EEG due to waxing and waning mental status and intermittent right gaze deviation.  This is a follow up study after a routine EEG was performed 1/3/2017.   MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: niCARdipine (CARDENE) 50 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL infusion metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 24 hr tablet 25 mg ipratropium-albuterol (DUO-NEB) nebulizer solution 3 mL insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 30 Units insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 3-15 Units furosemide (LASIX) injection 20 mg enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg morphine injection 2 mg insulin regular (HumuLIN R,NovoLIN R) injection 4 Units hydrALAZINE (APRESOLINE) injection 10 mg levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL acetaminophen (TYLENOL) suppository 650 mg ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL sodium phosphates (FLEET) enema 1 enema multivitamin (THERA-M) w/minerals tablet dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (1/5/2017, 10:23 - 1/6/2017, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The background is continuous but disorganized and consists of a mix of alpha and delta frequency activity. There is no posterior dominant rhythm. There is continuous right frontal polymorphic slowing. Often right frontal delta activity is asymmetrically higher in amplitude than left side, consistent with breach rhythm.  There is no reactivity to noxious stimulation. State change is present, with quieter periods consisting of attenuated alpha and increased theta and beta activity superimposed on background delta. Sleep transients are absent.  Moderate generalized slowing is present.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 80s-90s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Continuous right frontal polymorphic slowing  These findings indicate the presence of right frontal dysfunction, likely structural in etiology. There is additional evidence for a moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is etiologically nonspecific.  A right frontal breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known history of craniotomy.      -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (1/6/2017, 06:00 - 1/6/2017, 13:58)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 90s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change compared with day 1.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Continuous right frontal polymorphic slowing   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of right frontal dysfunction, likely structural in etiology. There is additional evidence for a moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is etiologically nonspecific.  A right frontal breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known history of craniotomy.
