DATE OF STUDY: 01/03/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, coma study




HISTORY:

a 75 y.o. female with a history of R ICH s/p craniotomy (no bone flap on R side),
referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

insulin regular (HumuLIN R,NovoLIN R) injection 2-10 Units


sodium chloride 0.9 % with KCl 20 mEq/L infusion

niCARdipine (CARDENE) 20 mg in NaCl (iso-os) 200 mL infusion

morphine injection 2 mg


insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 25 Units

insulin regular (HumuLIN R,NovoLIN R) injection 4 Units

hydrALAZINE (APRESOLINE) injection 10 mg

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous but disorganized and consists of a mix of alpha and delta frequency
activity, with occasional admixed <3 second periods of diffuse attenuation. There is no posterior
dominant rhythm.


There is continuous right frontal polymorphic slowing.



There is no reactivity to noxious stimulation. There is no variability or state change captured during
this 23 min study.



Severe generalized slowing is present.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:




None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal bedside portable EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing and disorganization, with lack of reactivity


2. Continuous right frontal polymorphic slowing

3. Tachycardia


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of right frontal dysfunction, likely structural in etiology. There is
additional evidence for a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is etiologically nonspecific.
