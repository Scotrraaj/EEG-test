DATE OF STUDY: 06/23/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 60 min, awake and asleep



HISTORY:

a 30 y.o. male with a history of two recent convulsions referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily (with meals). As needed


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz 70 uV posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
Posterior slow waves of youth are present..



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. POSTS.  Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal 1 hour  routine EEG:

1. no epileptiform features were noted



CLINICAL CORRELATION:





These findings are similar to her previous study performed at an outside institution, immediately after
the seizures last month.





Attending Epileptologist: 
I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
