HISTORY:

30 y.o. male with a history of 2 seizures since May, referred for routine EEG for
followup EEG to assess for persistent seizure activity.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

tiZANidine (ZANAFLEX) 2 mg tablet,

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 300 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

LORazepam (ATIVAN) 2 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet 30 min to 1 hour before MRI; can repeat once

naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily (with meals). As needed



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


Wakefulness is characterized by well-developed, medium voltage, symmetric and reactive 10-11
Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. Occasional left greater than right
temporal wicket activity is seen. Positive occipital sharp transients of sleep (POSTS) were also seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 80 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:




This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
