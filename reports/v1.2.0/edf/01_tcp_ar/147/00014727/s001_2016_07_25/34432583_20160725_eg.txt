HISTORY:

60 y.o. PT HAS A HISTORY OF SIMPLE COMPLEX  PARTIAL SEIZURES FOR
THE PAST 3 YEARS.


EEG REASON IS TO GET PT ON PROPER MEDS TO HELP HER NOT HAVE SEIZURES.



LAST SEIZURE WAS X1 MONTH AGO.


MEDICATIONS:


gabapentin


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:



A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically poor record with
T3 and T5 electrode misplug and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Normal very limited EEG






CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep poor quality routine EEG. Due to the electrode misplug and poor
quality this record should be repeated.
