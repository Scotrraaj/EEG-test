HISTORY:

61 y.o. WOMAN PATIENT WITH EVENTS AT NIGHT THAT INVOLVE
SHAKING FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AND  WEAKNESS. LASTING SEVERAL SECONDS MORE ON
BOTH SIDES


MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

aspirin EC tablet 81 mg

docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg


fluticasone (FLOVENT HFA) 220 mcg/actuation inhaler 1 puff

levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 88 mcg

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) tablet 50 mg


montelukast (SINGULAIR) tablet 10 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg

simvastatin (ZOCOR) tablet 20 mg


losartan (COZAAR) tablet 100 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL



enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system ith T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
