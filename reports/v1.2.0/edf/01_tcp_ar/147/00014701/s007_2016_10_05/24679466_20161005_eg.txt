HISTORY: This is a 61 y.o. left handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology. Onset after long hospitalization for cardiac disease.  Strictly nocturnal events.  Severe R knee pain.      Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.  Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons: - The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate. - Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus; - The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;   - The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient’s exam There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service  CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.   Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24 hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.    The spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.    MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: aspirin EC tablet 81 mg docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg fluticasone (FLOVENT HFA) 220 mcg/actuation inhaler 1 puff levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 88 mcg metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) tablet 50 mg montelukast (SINGULAIR) tablet 10 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg simvastatin (ZOCOR) tablet 20 mg losartan (COZAAR) tablet 100 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg  SEDATION:  None DAY 1 (10/03/2016 - 10/4/2016, 06:00) BACKGROUND: The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric,  well-organized, and consists predominantly of 10 Hz 40 uv alpha with admixed beta. Posterior dominant rhythm was present. The background is  reactive,  variable. There were  no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. Sleep was characterized by  symmetric sleep spindles and/or K-complexes.  Sleep was not sustained.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: limited   EVENTS: none  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: Normal wake and limited sleep EEG.
