83 y.o. female with a history of old stroke and seizures, with new onset
unresponsiveness, referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.

TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel bedside electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient was unresponsive and intubated during the study. Background activity consists of
generalized low to medium amplitude irregular 4-6 Hz activity which was most prominent over the
central and temporal regions. Medium to high amplitude irregular delta activity and superimposed
low to medium amplitude 7-8 Hz semirhythmic activity was seen anteriorly. Sharp waves and sharply
contoured slow waves were seen over bilateral anterior temporal regions at F7 greater than F8. At
times, this sharp activity demonstrated a pseudo-periodic character occurring every 1-2 seconds
(atypical BiPEDS). No abnormal movements or clinical changes in behavior with documented by the
EEG technician in association with the activity above.






OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic seizures captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 124 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal EEG due to:


1. Diffuse background disorganization and slowing

2. Left greater than right anterior temporal sharp waves and sharply contoured slow wave discharges,
occasionally occurring in a pseudo-periodic fashion.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:





These findings indicate the presence of a moderate to marked bihemispheric functional disturbance
of cerebral activity with left greater than right anterior temporal irritative discharges. Changes of this
type are nonspecific and can be seen with cerebral anoxia, cerebrovascular disease, interictally or
postictally, as well as with other diffuse or multifocal encephalopathies of various etiologies.
