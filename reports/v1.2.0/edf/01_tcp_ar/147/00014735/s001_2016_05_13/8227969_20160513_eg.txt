DATE OF STUDY: 05/13/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 73 y.o. male who presents after a seizure.



MEDICATIONS:

2 mg given prior to EEG




SEDATION: ativan



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

Patient is not cooperative with the study.  Patient is asleep nearly throughout the entire study.
During brief periods of arousals, the background voltages are low and background consists of lodiffuse
excess EMG artifact, minor movement artifact and diffuse excess beta activity.





Patient rapidly transitions to sleep.  Abundant symmetrical sleep spindles are captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of >100 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an unremarkable mostly asleep and briefly awake portable EEG.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an unremarkable mostly asleep and briefly awake portable EEG.


Patient is overall not cooperative with the study, so this EEG is somewhat limited.
