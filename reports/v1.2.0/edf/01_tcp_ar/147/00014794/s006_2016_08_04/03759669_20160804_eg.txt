HISTORY: 71 y.o. female with a history of lung adenocarcinoma metastatic to brain with a right frontal focus, s/p resection/radiation, referred for EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.  MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (8/2/2016, 10:13 - 8/3/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, poorly organized, and consists predominantly of alpha with admixed beta, with lack of well-defined anterior-posterior gradient and no clear posterior dominant rhythm. There is continuous polymorphic slowing over the right frontal region with admixed fast activity, consistent with breach rhythm.   Study is disconnected 8/2/2016 from 10:36 - 12:01. Study is disconnected 8/2/2016 from 20:24 - 23:31. Interpretation is difficult beginning 8/3/2016 05:29 as Fp2 becomes is affected by artifact, followed increasingly by other leads.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  See below under "Events"  EVENTS: Multiple subclinical seizures are captured on this day: 8/2/2016 at 10:13, 10:28, 12:01, 12:22, 12:40, 13:04, 13:08, 13:21, 13:25, 13:36, 13:52, 14:12, 14:28, 14:46, 15:03, 15:17, 15:34, 15:55, 16:08, 16:32, 16:46, 17:08, 17:29, 17:45, 17:59 8/3/2016 at 01:17, 03:57, 04:59 Duration: ranges from 1 min up to 6 min 15 sec CLINICAL: there is no obvious clinical correlate on video review; patient is not explicitly examined during most seizures. However, team notes waxing-waning mental status and episodic left gaze deviation prior to study start. EEG: Onset of sharply contoured alpha activity over the right frontal region (Fp2 max), which increases in amplitude and rhythmicity and spreads to the left frontal region. This ictal activity settles over the right frontal region (F4) as it evolves into higher amplitude theta. In some seizures (particular at beginning of study), ictal activity further slows to rhythmic alpha with embedded spikes before offset. Postictally, there is increased focal slowing and attenuation over the right frontal region.  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 70s.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: 1. Suboptimal organization 2. Continuous polymorphic slowing over the right frontal region 3. Right frontal breach rhythm 4. Ongoing focal status epilepticus of right frontal origin  These findings are diagnostic for focal epilepsy of right frontal origin, superimposed on a right frontal cerebral dysfunction that is likely structural in origin and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  A right frontal breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known history of craniotomy.      -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (8/3/2016, 06:00 - 8/4/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: No change in wakeful pattern. Quieter states are characterized by attenuation of alpha activity with increased prevalence of beta and delta. Leads are reconnected 8/3/2016 08:16. Study disconnected 8/3/2016 11:11-11:43, 14:52-15:25, 18:52-19:31, 20:44-20:55, 23:12-23:15; 8/4/2016 05:29-05:57  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: see below under "Events"  EVENTS:  Multiple subclinical seizures are captured on this day: 8/3/2016 at 09:06, 09:30, 11:04, 11:05, 11:49, 13:00, 13:14  CLINICAL: no definite correlate EEG: similar to previous day, with less robust evolution Duration is shorter, up to 2 min 30 sec  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s-80s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Suboptimal organization 2. Continuous polymorphic slowing over the right frontal region 3. Right frontal breach rhythm 4. Right frontal seizures, last on 8/3/2016 13:14     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (8/4/2016, 06:00 - 8/4/2016, 15:46)  BACKGROUND: No change Leads disconnected 8/4 08:13-08:41, 09:45-09:58, 11:37-13:16, 13:20-end of study.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change in background. No seizures.      -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Suboptimal organization 2. Continuous polymorphic slowing over the right frontal region 3. Right frontal breach rhythm 4. Focal seizures of right frontal origin, with status epilepticus, and last seizure on 8/3/2016 13:14   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are diagnostic for focal epilepsy of right frontal origin, superimposed on a right frontal cerebral dysfunction that is likely structural in origin and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  A right frontal breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known history of craniotomy.
