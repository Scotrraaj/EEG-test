DATE OF STUDY: 01/06/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy



HISTORY:

a 40 y.o. male with a history of 3 syncopal episodes over the past year referred for
routine EEG to evaluate for possible seizure activity as a cause of his syncope.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

loratadine (CLARITIN) 10 mg tablet,

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 40 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily for 90 days. Take 30
minutes before breakfast


SYMBICORT 160-4.5 mcg/actuation inhaler,


montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth nightly.

fluticasone-salmeterol (ADVAIR) 250-50 mcg/dose diskus inhaler, Inhale 1 puff into the lungs every
12 hours.


albuterol (VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every 6 hours as
needed for Wheezing. Indications: ACUTE ASTHMA ATTACK


mometasone (NASONEX) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray, Inhale 2 sprays into the nose daily.




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of 15-20 uV 10 Hz posterior
dominant rhythm and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-
to-posterior gradient.  Alpha activity attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 68 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
