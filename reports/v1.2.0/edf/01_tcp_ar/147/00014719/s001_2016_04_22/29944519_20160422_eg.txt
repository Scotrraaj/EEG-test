HISTORY:

53 y.o. WOMAN R HANDED. PT.STATES SHE HAS

HAD 4 EPISODES OF SYNCOPE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. PMHX.


THYROID DISEASE, MESTHIALAYSTITIS. SZ. SYNCOPE???


MEDICATIONS:


DILAUDID, HEPARIN,TORADOL, LORAZEPAM


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.



Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also


seen.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication

effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
