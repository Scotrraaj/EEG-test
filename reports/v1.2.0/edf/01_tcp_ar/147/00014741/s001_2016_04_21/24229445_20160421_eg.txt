SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A  Bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram


(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with

T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a


technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of

EKG .


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is low voltage but symmetric, reactive, and

consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal


beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior

gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and


reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which

attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  A low-voltage

pattern is a normal finding in an older adult.


Bradycardia may be relevant to this patient's cardiomyopathy

history.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
