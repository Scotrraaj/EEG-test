HISTORY: 63 yo F with left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. She was initially in Neurosurgery ICU where she had stable hemorrhage. She had seizures clinically, started on Keppra and monitored on EEG monitoring which did not show more seizures. She was extubated now and transferred to hepatology service and now is in Rehab. We were called for right arm and right face twitching that started around an hour ago. She has been stable on Keppra 1g q12. She was given 4mg of IV versed with decrease of twitching without complete resolution though. Currently she is awake and is able to say that this is what her initial seizures presented with.   History of liver disease For LTM for seizure management.   MEDICATIONS: levetiracetam (KEPPRA) tablet 1,500 mg, Phenobarbital dextromethorphan (DELSYM) 30 mg/5 mL liquid 30 mg lactulose (CHRONULAC) solution 10 g benzonatate (TESSALON) capsule 100 mg carbidopa-levodopa (SINEMET) 25-100 mg per tablet 1 tablet dextromethorphan-guaifenesin (ROBITUSSIN DM) 10-100 mg/5 mL syrup 10 mL furosemide (LASIX) tablet 20 mg insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 10 Units pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg rifaximin (XIFAXAN) tablet 550 mg alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL multivitamin (THERA-M) w/minerals tablet ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg amylase-lipase-protease (CREON) 6,000-19,000 -30,000 unit per capsule 1 capsule SEDATION: see above  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and Stimulation. The record was broken into two sections, and the EEG was unplugged briefly while the video was running after 12 MN.  DAY 1 ( 12/26/2016, 11:00) BP 112/64 (BP Location: Left arm, Patient Position: Lying)  Pulse 72  Temp 98.6 °F (37 °C) (Tympanic)  Resp 14  Ht 5' 5" (1.651 m)  Wt 184 lb 11.9 oz (83.8 kg)   SpO2 96%   BMI 30.74 kg/m2 Lab Results               PHENOBARB                15.7                12/27/2016           BACKGROUND: The waking background is  continuous, intermittently asymmetric, often well-organized, and consists predominantly of alpha with admixed theta.  Much of the wake record is symmetric with 11 Hz Posterior dominant rhythm the background is reactive, variable.  There were intermittent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. L focal slowing may be subtle or sharply contoured isolated wave forms or more sustained. Alpha is at times disrupted on the left.  Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles Slow wave sleep was not captured..  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY:  Sharply contoured activity seen in brief burst of periodic delta 7-10 seconds in wakefulness, without change in MSE  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Periodic C3 delta is noted, typically 2.4 Hz waves which can be seen every 2-3 seconds, intermittently in wakefulness or drowsiness. They are seen when the patient is awake, conversant or engaged in purposeful activity  There were two six second bursts of bi-frontal delta, without chewing- see 12:17:2016 on 12/26  EVENTS:  The  team  marked no clinical events- nursing reported none, though the physician team noted facial twitching on rounds Electrographic events: 20:38 12/26/2016 3 minute event with R eye twitching, visible. Patient awake, RN comes in and patient cooperates with bathing during event.  0.75-2.25 Hz Left frontal delta is associated with muscle twitch artifact.  06:20 AM- patient is wake, subtle chin/face movement is accompanied by twitch artifact with F# C3 0.3 Hz delta. This abates when the patient drifts off to sleep 07:41 1:06 duration- the patient is stimulated on rounds, has 0.3 Hz twitch of face, chin but is responsive. The twitch abates as she becomes drowsy.  EKG: A single lead captured 84 BPM  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: 1. Intermittent Left focal slowing 2. Bursts of periodic delta, noted when patient wake, sometimes associated with chewing but no change in MSE should be considered to a seizure. 3. Focal seizures without impairment of awareness, with ocular or facial twitching, perhaps stimulus sensitive. Noted only in wakefulness, suggestive of a "wake" EPC pattern.
