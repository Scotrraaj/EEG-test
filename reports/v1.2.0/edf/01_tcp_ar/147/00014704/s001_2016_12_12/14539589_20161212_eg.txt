SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with intermixed beta at times and absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.




Sleep is not captured


Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left central region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.




Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Lateralized periodic discharges at time quasi-rhythmic (LPD + R) present at C3 with a frequency of 1-
2Hz.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Left central LPD's +R


2. Left central continuous focal slow waves

3. Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to left central lateralized periodic discharges and
focal slow waves which is indicative of severe cortical structural focal cerebral dysfunction and
irritability in this region. In addition there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction. Patient will be placed in continuous monitoring.
