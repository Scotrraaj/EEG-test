HISTORY:

72 y.o. male with a history of acute, repetitive seizures characterized by chin
twitch and left eye deviation referred for routine EEG for treatment of status epilepticus.



MEDICATIONS:


VPA 2700 mg, Ativan 12 mg


No current outpatient prescriptions on file.




SEDATION: see above



TECHNIQUE:

A STAT portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system  with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal  Stimulation.
Initially, there is a great deal of muscle artifact, less as the Ativan increases.






EEG BACKGROUND:


BACKGROUND:

The background is continuous, asymmetric, poorly organized, and consists predominantly of delta,
particularly in the right posterior and some beta and theta.


There is continuous R posterior delta (focal slowing superimposed on a slow background.



Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.


The background is  reactive,  variable.



There were persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Abundant (>1/10s) R occipital with spread at times to the left


EVENTS:


There are clinical and  electrographic events captured during this study.

The twitching stops with ativan but the electrographic seizures continue

HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 104 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal STAT ED digital video EEG due to:

electrographic status epilepticus- with epileptiform activity from R posterior quadrant, spreading to
left occipital region
