HISTORY: 72 y.o. male with a history of ETOH abuse, admitted in ED with recurrent seizures characterized by L gaze deviation and chin twitch, now obtunded after 12 mg Ativan and 2700 VPA referred for EEG for treatment of status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: midazolam (VERSED) 50 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL infusion  No current outpatient prescriptions on file.
SEDATION: see above
TECHNIQUE: A continuous video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and seizure/spike detection software.
DAY 1 ( - 8/25/2016, 23:00- 08/26/2016) midazolam (VERSED) , VPA, later Phenobarbital
BACKGROUND: The EEG begins with a background is continuous, asymmetric, poorly organized, and consists predominantly of delta, particularly in the right posterior and some beta and theta. The patient had been started on a Versed drip in the emergency room and intubated. The O for all initial pattern is rhythmic delta in the right posterior quadrant with sharp waves mixed in. The pattern is nearly continuous. Over the course of the night, the medication was gradually titrated upward. As the hours progress in the medication is titrated upwards, the overall pattern transitions to rhythmic slowing from the right hemisphere Later, there is intermittent burst suppression pattern. In the periods with cerebral activity however, there is rhythmic delta noted from the right hemisphere, compatible with an ongoing ictal pattern. Posterior dominant rhythm was not present on the right. By 1 PM, after the doses of vena barbital, the EEG is transitioning more to a PLEDs/PLEDs plus pattern Despite the dramatic changes in the EEG, there are portions when the patient seems to be awake particularly 4 AM with eye movement and once again a more continuous pattern, despite rhythmic slowing from the right hemisphere.  Phenobarbital was given in 2 doses on the morning of the 27th. The background is reactive, variable.  There were persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Abundant (>1/10s) R occipital with spread at times to the left
EVENTS: None clinical all electrographic.  Later ictal patterns include: a pattern with fast activity from the right frontal region a pattern with rhythmic theta delta from the right hemisphere  pattern with periodic delta from the right posterior quadrant
EKG: A single lead captured HR 104
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Initially electrographic status epilepticus, transitioning to a right hemispheric complex periodic discharge which remains highly irritative but without clear frequency evolution.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

DAY 2 (08/26/2016, 06:00 - 8/27/2016, )
BACKGROUND: No change
GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change
FOCAL SLOWING: No change
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Sharply contoured activity
SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: highly irritative bursts of sharp waves from R posterior temporal region or R frontal region, in brief bursts without clear evolution.
EVENTS: No clinical events reported or detected Ictal patterns of subclinical seizures are less defined. The burst of right frontal fast activity abates.
EKG: A single EKG lead captured 104 BPM
DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Well defined seizures have evolved into brief bursts of sharp waves with variable maxima on the right.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

DAY 3 (08/27/2016, 06:00 - 8/28/2016, 11 PM) Current medication list which includes t, phenobarbital (LUMINAL), valproate (DEPACON) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB, ceftriaxone (ROCEPHIN) 1 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+, midazolam in normal saline (VERSED), multivitamin (THERAGRAN), folic acid (FOLVITE), and
BACKGROUND: variable - at times burst suppression pattern, at others, muscle, EOMS and low voltage theta
GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change
FOCAL SLOWING: no major focal slowing
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None
SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Abundant (>1/10s) R hemispheric spiking, often in bursts or trains, usually less than 10 seconds duration, now more likely to be frontal maximum than posterior. The bursts may be accompanied by fast activity.
EVENTS: No clinical events reported or detected
EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 104
DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Variable pattern but has transitioned to a burst suppression pattern with sharp waves now R frontal. This remains a very irritative pattern.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

DAY 4 (08/28/2016, 06:00 - 8/29/2016, 10:00) has a current medication list which includes the following Facility-Administered Medications: potassium, sodium phosphates (PHOS-NAK), phenobarbital (LUMINAL), thiamine (B-1) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB, valproate (DEPACON) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB multivitamin (THERAGRAN), folic acid (FOLVITE),
BACKGROUND: None
GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change, basically burst suppression with intermittent arousal
FOCAL SLOWING: None
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None
SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: ongoing pattern of bursts of R hemispheric sharps/ spikes (BIRDS) typically less than 10 seconds, but still often exceeding 10 sec or occurring in clusters
EVENTS: none clinical  EKG: A single EKG lead captured 80 BPM 
DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Burst suppression pattern with brief electrographic discharges, some long enough to be considered clear seizures. Despite the ominous pattern the patient intermittently seems to wake up, has EOMs , though spikes persist. Findings discussed with team.

BACKGROUND: No major change, more continuous, often with eye movements. Transitions intermittently to theta /delta background
GENERALIZED SLOWING: improving
FOCAL SLOWING: No change
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None
SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: "BIRDS" from R hemisphere or R frontal region intermittently disappear. In lieu of "BIRDS" there are sporadic or semi periodic R>L frontal sharps or spikes, with bursts of only a few seconds at times  EVENTS: No clinical events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 96 BPM
DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Versed was stopped. At times, the epileptiform activity seems to wane, but there are some longer bursts noted on the AM of 8/30/2016. The EEG is more continuous and overall, the EEG is improving, though some discharges can still be considered ictal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

DAY 6 (8/30/2016. - 8/31/2016., 11:30) During this section, sedative medicines were weaned. The patient was increasingly alert and was extubated.  BACKGROUND: No change initially, then more continuous bilaterally
GENERALIZED SLOWING: improved
FOCAL SLOWING: No change
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None
SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) but fewer "BIRDS" and ictal like discharges, transitions to just frequent spikes from R hemisphere  EVENTS: none  EKG: A single EKG lead captured 76
DAY 6 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Although this is a very epileptiform EEG, the seizures stopped and the epileptiform activity improved.
OVERALL IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION Resolution of refractory status epilepticus but ongoing cortical irritability
