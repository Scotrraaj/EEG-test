DATE OF STUDY: 09/13/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 72 y.o. male with a history of alcohol abuse who recently presented with status
epilepticus of right hemispheric involvement, now referred for routine EEG for assessment of
persistent agitation, delusions, hallucinations, and tangentiality.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


magnesium oxide (MAG-OX) tablet 800 mg

thiamine (B-1) injection 100 mg

[START ON 9/14/2016] QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) tablet 50 mg


QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) tablet 75 mg

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) tablet 90 mg

nicotine (NICODERM CQ) patch 14 mg


haloperidol lactate (HALDOL) injection 0.5 mg

haloperidol (HALDOL) tablet 0.5 mg

cyanocobalamin tablet 1,000 mcg




acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 20 mg


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

multivitamin (THERAGRAN) tablet 1 tablet


folic acid (FOLVITE) tablet 1 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with fragments of a symmetric and reactive 9-9.5 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep spindles are seen less clearly over the right.


No generalized slowing is present.


There is occasional right posterior quadrant focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Frequent right occipital (O2) spike-wave

2. Occasional right temporal (T4) spike-wave

3. Occasional diffuse right hemispheric spike-wave



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Occasional right posterior quadrant focal slowing

2. Frequent right occipital (O2) spike-wave


3. Occasional right temporal (T4) spike-wave

4. Occasional diffuse right hemispheric spike-wave


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of epileptogenic potential of right occipital and temporal
origin, as well as broadly over the right hemisphere, superimposed on right posterior quadrant
cerebral dysfunction. There were no seizures captured on this study.
