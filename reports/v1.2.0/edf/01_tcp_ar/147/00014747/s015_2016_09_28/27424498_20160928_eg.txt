HISTORY:

72 y.o. male with a history of dementia, delirium, alcohol abuse, right frontal
encephalomalacia, and status epilepticus referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status
change.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


chlordiazePOXIDE (LIBRIUM) capsule 10 mg

risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) tablet 1 mg

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) tablet 60 mg


lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) tablet 150 mg

TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The patient was drowsy or asleep during much of the tracing with periods of restless or agitated
arousal. The waking background is poorly organized, demonstrating low to medium amplitude 7-8 Hz
activity posteriorly which occasionally was better developed on the left, intermixed with irregular
medium amplitude and a large amount of muscle and movement artifact. Occasional low amplitude
12-15 Hz activity was seen over bilateral frontal regions, likely representing sleep spindles.
Intermittent arm shaking was noted with accompanying muscle artifact but no other changes in
underlying cerebral electrical activity.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm with occasional PVCs is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG due to:


1. Background disorganization and increased irregular slow activity.




2. Mild asymmetry of the dominant posterior rhythm during wakefulness which, at times, appeared
slightly better developed on the left.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are indicative of a mild to moderate by hemispheric functional disturbance, at times
slightly more pronounced on the right, without any clinical or electrographic seizures and with no
definite pathologic paroxysmal epileptiform discharges recorded.
