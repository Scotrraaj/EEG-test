DATE OF STUDY: 09/16/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep





HISTORY:

a 41 y.o. female with a history of status epilepticus referred for routine EEG for
screening for subclinical seizures.


Known CP, onset of seizures in PACU after procedure for hammertoe at . Treated
with intubation Keppra 3 grams, Depakote 2 grams, ativan 10mg, and IV sedation. Seizures stopped,
patient started to wake up. Prompting wean of sedation and extubation. Patient had additional spell
of what sounds like a tonic seizures.



She does have a background Hx. Of seizures.

MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 1 mg

morphine injection 1 mg


valproate (DEPACON) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

TECHNIQUE:



A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and  Stimulation.  This is a challenging bedside ICU record
with significant electrode artifact. Snore artifact is present



EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient is somnolent throughout the EEG.  There is a continuous, mixed frequency pattern with
theta, diffuse beta and some shifting frontal delta.  When unstimulated, there are clear features of
stage II sleep including 15 Hz spindles noted in the central regions.  Stimulation of the patient
produces an increase in theta and delta.  The record may briefly be somewhat slower on the right
than the left initially following stimulation.




Generalized slowing is present.

No additional focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Frontal delta



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: See above


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1.  Generalized background slowing with questionable superimposed focal slowing on the right



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings may be part of postictal state or medication effect.  This was a technically
challenging record with electrode artifacts.  Epileptiform activity may have been underrecognized.
Long term monitoring will follow
