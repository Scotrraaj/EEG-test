START DATE OF STUDY: 09/16/16 at 09:32 END DATE OF STUDY: 09/17/16 at 09:25  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:  EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 41 y.o. female with a history of cerebral palsy and seizures who presented for an elective amputation of a hammertoe and then had multiple convulsions (4 episodes of generalized tonic extension (possibly starting with LUE) and right gaze deviation x4, improved after 3 mg Ativan, then followed by a prolonged convulsion with tonic gaze deviation, intubated and transferred to TUH for treatment of convulsive status. Patient was able to be extubated on arrival, but within 5 hours developed the above episodes again, this time not requiring intubation. She is now undergoing EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.  MEDICATIONS: 9/15: at outside hospital, received Ativan 10 mg Keppra load 2 g VPA load 20 mg/kg Intubated and started on propofol  Current Facility-Administered Medications: LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 1 mg morphine injection 1 mg valproate (DEPACON) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (9/16/2016, 09:32 - 9/17/2016, 09:24)  BACKGROUND: *Please note that the study stops at 09/16 09:41 and resumes at 15:41. Leads are disconnected at 16:20 and reconnected at 16:52. Thereafter the study is progressively affected by lead artifact until 20:35. Again leads are disconnected 9/17 05:31-06:24.  Background is continuous, symmetric, and consists of mix of delta, alpha, and beta.  Synchronous and symmetric sleep spindles are noted.  The background is reactive and variable, with attenuation of delta and increased prevalence of faster frequencies during stimulation; however, during stimulation the background remains disorganized theta and delta activity without a clear posterior dominant rhythm. Sustained prolonged periods of wakefulness are not captured.  Mild-moderate generalized slowing is present.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 80s  FINAL IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Mild-moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization  FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a mild-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. They may be seen in the setting of a medication effect and/or postictal state.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (9/17/2016, 06:00 - 9/17/2016, 07:20)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s-90s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change
