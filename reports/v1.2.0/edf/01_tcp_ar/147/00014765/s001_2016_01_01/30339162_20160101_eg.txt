HISTORY:  An 18-year-old woman of unknown handedness,

hypercoagulable state, presented with acute right MCA infarct and

was treated with thrombolysis. Large right MCA territory infarct


without hemorrhagic conversion. Mildincrease in leftward midline

shift, now measuring 4-5mm, with mildright uncal crowding of the

suprasellar cistern. Small left parietal and temporal lobe


infarcts.



MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin, gentamicin, and Dilaudid.




INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU

using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one


channel EKG.  The patient was somnolent, but sometimes moving

about.




DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly

abnormal and demonstrates an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.

The left hemisphere is with medium amplitude mixed frequency.


There is 12.69 hertz of faster frequency activity noted in the




left hemisphere at the midline, but otherwise missing from the

right hemisphere.  The right hemisphere demonstrates more


significant arrhythmic delta activity.




Tactile stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting

response with an increase in frontally predominant rhythmic delta

activity present more prominently on the left than the right but

present bilaterally.




Occasional isolated bursts of frontally predominant 3-4 Hz delta


activity are noted again left more so than right.



Heart rate 86 to 96 bpm.




IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:

1. Marked, bilateral background slowing.


2. An asymmetry with prominent disruption of faster frequency

activity on the right compared to the left.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Although the pattern described above is


worrisome, the presence of reactivity is a positive prognostic

feature.  These findings may be correlated with imaging.
