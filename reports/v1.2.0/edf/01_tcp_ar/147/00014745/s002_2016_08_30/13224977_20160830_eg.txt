DATE OF STUDY: 08/30/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 47 y.o. 47 yr female follow up eeg.  pt with acute resp failure / trached,
hypoxia, wernickes encephalopathy, abd mass, sepsis



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

acetylcysteine (MUCOMYST) 20 % 1 mL plus albuterol 2.5 mg/3 mL nebulizer mixture solution

potassium chloride IVPB 20 mEq 100 mL


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 70 mg

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) injection 5 mg

ipratropium-albuterol (DUO-NEB) nebulizer solution 3 mL


thiamine (B-1) 250 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

dextrose 5 % and sodium chloride 0.45 % infusion

insulin regular (HumuLIN R,NovoLIN R) injection 2-10 Units


pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg

ampicillin-sulbactam (UNASYN) 3 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB MB+



fentaNYL (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection 25 mcg

white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application


nicotine (NICODERM CQ) patch 14 mg

cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) tablet 5 mg



SEDATION: IN OR PT. RECD 200 FENTANYL AND 3 MG VECURONIUM THIS AM


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse  theta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.



Sleep is not captured



Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Mild to moderate generalized slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
