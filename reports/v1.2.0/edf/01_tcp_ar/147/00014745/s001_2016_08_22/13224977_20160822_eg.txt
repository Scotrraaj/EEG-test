DATE OF STUDY: 08/22/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, coma





HISTORY:

a 47 y.o. female with a history of PVD s/p bilaterally BKA, GERD, and DVT p/w
worsening sepsis. Unable to wean from vent, not waking up.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

sodium phosphate 30 mmol in dextrose 5 % in water 250 mL IVPB

potassium chloride IVPB 20 mEq 100 mL


ampicillin-sulbactam (UNASYN) 3 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB MB+

heparin 25,000 units (100 units/mL) in 0.45% sodium chloride 250 mL infusion (Premix)

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 2-10 Units


sodium chloride 0.45 % infusion

fentaNYL (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection 25 mcg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg


chlorhexidine (PERIDEX) 0.12 % solution 15 mL

hydrogen peroxide solution 3%



white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application

nicotine (NICODERM CQ) patch 14 mg


cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) tablet 5 mg




SEDATION: propofol drip was discontinued on 8/19/16.


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.



Sleep is not captured.



Severe generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


On verbal stimulation, there is some reactivity seen on EEG.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to:


1. Severe generalized slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

The findings of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
