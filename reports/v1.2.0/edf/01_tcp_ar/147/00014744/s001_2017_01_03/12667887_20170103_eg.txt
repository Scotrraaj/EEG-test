HISTORY:

80 y.o. female admitted with leg wounds, with past history of meningioma,
referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) tablet 50 mg

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 10 mg


cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN) 1 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+

ketoconazole (NIZORAL) 2 % cream 1 Application

oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet 1 tablet


diclofenac (VOLTAREN) EC tablet 50 mg

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) capsule 300 mg

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 40 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL



enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to near continuous diffuse muscle artifact, and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Occasional left hemispheric focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal, albeit technically limited due to diffuse muscle artifact, awake only routine EEG
due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization




2. Left hemispheric occasional polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a left hemispheric dysfunction (which may
be correlated with imaging) superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
