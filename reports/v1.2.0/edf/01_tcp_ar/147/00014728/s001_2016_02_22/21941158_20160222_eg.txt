HISTORY:

71 y.o. FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O ISCHEMIC

STROKE



MEDICATIONS:

NO AED's



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and


amplitude is present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.



Continuous polymorphic delta is seen in the left hemisphere

maximal in the fronto temporal region and at times more


posterior.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1.  Continuous focal slowing seen in the left hemisphere maximal

in the fronto temporal region and and at times more posterior.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are indicative of focal structural cerebral

dysfunction in that region, which is consistent with the known

stroke.
