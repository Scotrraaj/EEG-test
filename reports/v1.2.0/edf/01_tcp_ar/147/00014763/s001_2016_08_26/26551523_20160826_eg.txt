HISTORY:

67 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy since age 16 and HTN, found having
generalized seizures x3 min this AM, with 2 more seizures in ED, referred for routine EEG for
management of seizure exacerbation.




MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Phenytoin, Lovenox, Tylenol



SEDATION: as above


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:








The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha, theta, and excess of beta frequencies, with admixed delta, and without a clear posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
absent.




During drowsiness and sleep, slow rolling eye movements and further background slowing are seen.
No well-formed sleep transients are seen.



Moderate generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Occasional (1/hour to <1min) left fronto-central (F3/C3 max) spike-and-wave dischargse


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate generalized slowing

2. Poor organization

3. Occasional left fronto-central spike-and-wave discharges



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a left fronto-central potentially epileptogenic focus
superimposed on moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
