HISTORY:

25 y.o. female with a history of headaches and pituitary adenoma referred for
routine EEG for headache.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


naproxen (NAPROSYN) 375 mg tablet, TK 1 T PO BID

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: none


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically challenging
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation. C4 artifact was present as
was muscle artifact




EEG BACKGROUND:



The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. There is an alpha harmonic of 17 Hz noted bilaterally.
Mu was noted, but testing to confirm not done.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: elicits an increase in amplitude



Photic Stimulation: obscured by artifact


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.



Alpha supraharmonic is a normal finding.
