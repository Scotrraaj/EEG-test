HISTORY: 26 y.o. female with a history of tuberous sclerosis, epilepsy, and nonepileptic seizures, referred for EEG for management of seizure exacerbation. Patient was found altered with jerking movements of both arms with eye closure on afternoon of presentation. Per mother, she has ~1 seizure a week characterized by slow head deviation towards either the right or the left.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN) 1 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+ vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+ sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units valproate (DEPACON) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB  She has received 4 mg Ativan, 3 g Keppra, and is undergoing VPA load 15 mg/kg.  SEDATION: as documented above  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/3/2016, 21:22 - 11/4/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous and symmetric but consists of a poorly organized mixture of delta, alpha, and beta. There is no reactivity to noxious stimulation; there is no state change.  The background is otherwise featureless, with no posterior dominant rhythm or sleep transients.  Severe generalized slowing is present.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Intermittent chewing artifact is noted, more prominently over the left.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Occasional (1/hour to <1min) runs of 2Hz left frontal rhythmic delta activity are noted lasting < 5 sec, without evolution. Occasionally this activity is more generalized (generalized rhythmic delta activity, or GRDA also known as FIRDA).  EVENTS:  Beginning at 11/3/2016 05:57, 10-20 second periods of diffuse muscle artifact occurring approximately every 5 min are noted on EEG EEG: background is obscured by diffuse muscle activity, frontally predominant. With high cut filter reduced from 70 Hz to 30 Hz, there is no definite underlying cerebral ictal activity, and no change in background postictally. However, muscle artifact is characteristic of tonic seizure, then brief clonic muscle artifact as facial/neck muscles twitch. CLINICAL: patient opens eyes and has nonforced head turn towards RIGHT with 1-2 twitches of frontalis muscles and neck muscles, then turns head back towards midline. EKG: no change  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 80s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing and disorganization 2. Occasional L hemispheric lateralized rhythmic delta activity, occasionally seen more diffusely 3. Episodes of diffuse muscle artifact on EEG without clear ictal cerebral correlate, but suspected to be tonic seizures based on appearance of artifact  These findings are consistent with diffuse epileptogenic potential as well as left hemispheric epileptogenic potential, superimposed on a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is at least in part due to medications. The episodes described above carry an electrographic signature most characteristic of tonic seizure.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (11/4/2016, 06:00 - 11/5/2016, 06:00)  AEDs: phenobarbital 2.5 mg/kg load q4 hours begun ~22:00  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Intermittent chewing artifact is noted, more prominently over the left.  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Same as day 1   EVENTS:  Episodes similar to those described on day 1 continue on this day, with similar clinical manifestations and similar EEG findings. No tonic muscle stiffening when patient is examined, but she appears less responsive and consistently turns head rightward (though not forced). Throughout first half of day, episodes occur ~8-10 times per hour (range: 3-16) and last 10-20 sec in duration By ~11/5 00:00 episodes decrease in frequency to ~6-7 times per hour (same duration)  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Ongoing tonic seizures.      -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (11/5/2016, 06:00 - 11/6/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): No change  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No change  EVENTS:  Episodes similar to those described on days 1-2 continue on this day, with similar clinical manifestations and similar EEG findings. No tonic muscle stiffening when patient is examined, but she appears less responsive and consistently turns head rightward (though not forced). Episodes occur an average of 6-7x per hour up until 14:00, at which point episodes occur an average of 3-4x/hour. Last seizure is 11/5 16:34 until 11/6: she has 2 seizures between 02:00-03:00 and 2 seizures between 04:00-05:00.   EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Tonic seizures decrease in frequency by 11/5 14:00 but have not resolved. Background remains severely slow, at least in part associated with a medication effect.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 4 (11/6/2016, 06:00 - 11/7/2016, 06:00)  Study disconnected 11/6 14:29-14:54.  BACKGROUND: Disorganized mix of alpha and beta alternating with periods of increased theta and delta  GENERALIZED SLOWING: Moderate-severe  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No change  EVENTS:  11/6/2016 09:34 11/7/2016 01:58 Tonic seizures, with similar electrographic and clinical manifestations as reported on previous days  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s   DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Tonic seizures continue to decrease in frequency. Background demonstrates state change - slowing improves to "moderate-severe."  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 5 (11/7/2016, 06:00 - 11/8/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: awake background consists of disorganized beta and theta; no clear posterior dominant rhythm. Sleep is characterized by further slowing, with rudimentary sleep spindles and K complexes  GENERALIZED SLOWING: moderate  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No change  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 50s-90s   DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No seizures. The degree of background slowing improves to "moderate."     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 6 (11/8/2016, 06:00 - 11/8/2016, 09:12)  BACKGROUND: same as day 7  GENERALIZED SLOWING: moderate  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s   DAY 6 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Same as day 5. No seizures.      -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Severe generalized slowing and disorganization, improving to moderate generalized slowing by end of study 2. Occasional L hemispheric lateralized rhythmic delta activity, occasionally seen more diffusely 3. Episodes of diffuse muscle artifact on EEG without clear ictal cerebral correlate, but suspected to be tonic seizures based on appearance of artifact, all associated with slow head deviation towards the right with brief facial twitching followed by decreased responsiveness.   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are consistent with diffuse epileptogenic potential as well as left hemispheric epileptogenic potential, superimposed on a diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is at least in part due to medications, improving to "moderate" by the end of the study. The episodes described above carry an electrographic signature most characteristic of tonic seizure.
