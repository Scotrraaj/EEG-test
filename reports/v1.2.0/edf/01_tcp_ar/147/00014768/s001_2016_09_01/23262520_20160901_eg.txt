system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and tactile, verbal  Stimulation. EEG was reviewed at high
sensitivity and multiple montages




EEG BACKGROUND:

The EEG demonstrates a markedly suppressed pattern.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1.absence of cerebral activity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:
