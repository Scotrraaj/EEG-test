HISTORY: 52 y.o. MALE R HANDED. PT WIFE WITNESSED HIM HAVING A SZ AT HOME AND THEN EMS WITNESSED SZ. WITH PROLONGED POST ICTAL  PMHX. HTN, OSA,DN NO H/O SZ.  MEDICATIONS: VALPROIC ACID,  DILANTIN   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (07/04/2016, 10:08 - 7/5/2016, 08:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal (left more than right) regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.   DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal (left more than right) regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. ---------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (07/05/2016, 08:00- 7/6/2016, 09:49)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.
