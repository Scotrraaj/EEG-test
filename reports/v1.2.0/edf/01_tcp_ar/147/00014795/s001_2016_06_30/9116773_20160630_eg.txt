DATE OF STUDY: 06/30/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 52 y.o. male with a history of HTN, OSA and first ever seizures referred for routine
EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


metformin (GLUCOPHAGE) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1,000 mg by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).

GLIPIZIDE PO, Take  by mouth.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.2 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There is
generous beta and modest excess theta.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  In drowsiness, prominent bursts of
shifting slowing were seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Shifting focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: verbal stimuli elicits and alerting with limited alpha

EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Background slowing

2. Excess beta


3. Shifting slowing in drowsiness.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are non specific. This may be a post-ictal pattern. No epileptiform features were seen.
Correlation with clinical history and imaging is suggested.





Attending Epileptologist: 


I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
