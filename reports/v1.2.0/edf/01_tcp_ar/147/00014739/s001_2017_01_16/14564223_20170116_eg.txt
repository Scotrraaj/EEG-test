HISTORY:

20 yo male presents from OSH aftre having 10 seizure episodes. Pt has had
seizures since childhood after head trauma. 2 brothers have epilepsy



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 1,000 mg

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


lacosamide (VIMPAT) tablet 200 mg

levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 25 mcg

divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 24 hr tablet 1,000 mg






SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

Limited wakefulness reveals a background activity was characterized by diffuse theta activity with an
absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. The posterior dominant rhythm
is poorly formed an at best 8Hz.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is atypical characterized by very periodic 1 Hz vertex waves with a lower amplitude over the
right temporal leads. . Slow wave sleep was not captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

Two seizures are captured


generalized paroxymal fast activity and largely obscured by muscle artifact that then becomes
intermittent and suddenly stops.



Tonic posturing of upper extremities followed by clonic movements.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:




This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to

1. Two generalized seizures.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


The two seizures appear to have a generalized onset suggestive of generlazed epilepsy. In addition
there diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
