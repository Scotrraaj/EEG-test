HISTORY:

67 y.o. male with a history of L MCA stroke

referred for EEG for assessment of mental status change and right


gaze deviation.


MEDICATIONS: Ativan 2 mg x2, Fosphenytoin load, Keppra



SEDATION: as aboveTECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:



The waking background is continuous but asymmetric.




The right hemisphere consists of alpha and theta with admixed low

amplitude


amplitude delta.

The left hemisphere consists of low amplitude amplitude delta and


theta,

with attenuated fast frequencies.


Rhythms are not clearly reactive to noxious stimulation. There is


no state change captured.



There is moderate to severe generalized slowing.

There is continuous left hemispheric slowing and attenuation of

fast frequencies.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 80 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing.


2. Continuous left hemispheric slowing and attenuation of

fast frequencies.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of left hemispheric

dysfunction and cortical injury, likely structural in etiology,


superimposed on moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
