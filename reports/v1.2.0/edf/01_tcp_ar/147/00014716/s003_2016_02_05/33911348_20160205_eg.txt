HISTORY: 67 y.o. male with a history of L MCA stroke referred for EEG for assessment of mental status change and right gaze deviation.  MEDICATIONS: Ativan 2 mg x2, Fosphenytoin load, Keppra  SEDATION: as above  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (2/5/2016, 07:48 - 2/5/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous but asymmetric. The right hemisphere consists of alpha and theta with admixed amplitude delta, with fragments of an irregular posterior dominant rhythm that approach 7 Hz. Organization is fair. The left hemisphere consists of amplitude delta and theta, with attenuated fast frequencies. Organization is poor.  Sleep is characterized by further background slowing. Well-formed sleep transients are not seen.  There is mild generalized slowing. There is continuous left hemispheric slowing and attenuation of fast frequencies.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Very rare right posterior quadrant (T6/P4/C4>O2) sharp waves  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 80s-90s.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Continuous left hemispheric slowing and attenuation of fast frequencies 3. Very rare right posterior quadrant (T6/P4/C4>O2) sharp waves  These findings are indicative of right posterior quadrant epileptogenic potentials and left hemispheric dysfunction/cortical injury (likely structural in etiology), superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (2/6/2016, 06:00 - 2/6/2016, 13:22)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Same as day 1    -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Continuous left hemispheric slowing and attenuation of fast frequencies 3. Very rare right posterior quadrant (T6/P4/C4>O2) sharp waves   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are indicative of right posterior quadrant epileptogenic potentials and left hemispheric dysfunction/cortical injury (likely structural in etiology), superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
