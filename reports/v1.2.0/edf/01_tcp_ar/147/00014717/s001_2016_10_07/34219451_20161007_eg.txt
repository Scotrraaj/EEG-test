HISTORY:

80 y.o. female with a history of acute stroke with right hand weakness. referred
for routine EEG for presurgical evaluation.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet 1 tablet

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


aspirin (BAYER) tablet 325 mg

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) capsule 100 mg


amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 10 mg

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.

Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, and
K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG  for a subject of this age.

There are rare bursts of shifting slowing.
