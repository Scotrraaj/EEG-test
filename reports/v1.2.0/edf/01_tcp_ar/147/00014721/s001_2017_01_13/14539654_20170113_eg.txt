DATE OF STUDY: 01/13/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 34 y.o. male with a history of MVA, skull fracture with right subarachnoid and
intracerebral hemorrhage, status post right craniectomy and evacuation of hematoma, referred for
follow-up EEG for assessment of mental status change.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:

SEDATION: Noted in medication list above.


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background consists of diffuse low-voltage irregular 3-7 Hz activity with nearly continuous
asymmetric right greater than left hemispheric medium amplitude 0.75-3 Hz polymorphic delta
activity. Occasional low voltage muscle artifact was noted over frontocentral temporal regions,
somewhat more prominent on the left. At the end of the recording, tactile stimulation produced mild
agitated arousal with the patient flexing his legs and trying to sit up in bed. Movement and muscle
artifact were noted which obscured the underlying cerebral electrical activity.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:



A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:


1. Generalized asymmetric right greater than left hemispheric slowing. Normal waking background
activity is not seen.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of a severe right greater than left hemispheric functional
disturbance without any clinical or electrical seizures and with no definite paroxysmal epileptiform
discharges recorded. These changes are similar to those noted on prior EEG of 12/28/16.
