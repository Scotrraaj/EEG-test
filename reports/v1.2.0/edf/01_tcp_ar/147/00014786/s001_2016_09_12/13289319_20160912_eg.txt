DATE OF STUDY: 09/12/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 77 y.o. female with a history of R subdural hematoma, episode L facial twitch
referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

RANITIDINE HCL (ZANTAC PO), Take  by mouth. Indications: UNKNOWN DOSE-CHECK WITH
PATIENT
DILTIAZEM HCL PO, Take 180 mg by mouth. Indications: UNKNOWN DOSE-CHECK WITH PATIENT


TRIAMTERENE/HYDROCHLOROTHIAZID (DYAZIDE PO), Take  by mouth. Indications: UNKNOWN
DOSE-CHECK WITH PATIENT


LOVASTATIN PO, Take  by mouth. Indications: UNKNOWN DOSE-CHECK WITH PATIENT

IBUPROFEN (MOTRIN PO), Take  by mouth. Indications: UNKNOWN DOSE-CHECK WITH PATIENT

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  There is a great deal of
muscle artifact noted on the right






EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  R breach is noted in drowsy

Sleep is not sustained



No generalized slowing is present.

Intermittent R>L  focal slowing is present. On the right there may be three 3-4 Hz bursts of slowing.
On the left, there is isolated theta/delta, typical in this age group.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per
second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE: A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This  routine EEG is only slightly abnormal for a subject of this age:

R>L temporal slowing in otherwise normal background



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This routine EEG.does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
