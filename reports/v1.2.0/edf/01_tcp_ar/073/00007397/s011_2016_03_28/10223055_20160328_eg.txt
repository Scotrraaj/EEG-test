HISTORY:


54 y.o. MAN WITH A HISTORY OF A LEFT SIDED

ANEURSYM CLIPPING AFTER HAVING A FALL IN 1986.

PMHX- GRANDMAL SEIZURES . LAST SEIZURE WAS many YEARS AGO.  He


became seizure free when Keppra was added to TPM and CBZ.  Now

has episodes of agitation, which on occasion have been followed

by somnolence from which he abruptly and dramatically awakens.


He is aware of these episodes.


MEDICATIONS:


topiramate (TOPAMAX) 100 mg tablet, Take 2 tabs daily: 2 in AM 2

in PM

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2


times daily.

TECHNIQUE:

Continuous  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)


was




recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included seizure and spike detection

software with 24 hour technical and clinical supervision



-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 1(03/28/2016 - 3/29/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND: In wakefulness, the overall EEG is low-voltage.


There is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm noted.  Stage II sleep

includes vertex waves, K complexes spindles and POSTS.


GENERALIZED SLOWING: None



FOCAL SLOWING: None



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



EVENTS: None



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60-90 BPM




DAY 1  IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



Normal Awake and asleep study. No events were captured.



-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 2 (03/29/16, 06:00 - 3/30/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: LEV, TPM taper



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reaches


9 Hz. Low voltage awake pattern


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured..



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


EKG: A single lead captured 66 BPM, regular

DAY 2  IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



Normal Awake and asleep study. No events were captured.


-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 3 (03/30/2016, 06:00 - 3/31/2016, 06:00)



AEDs:  LEV only


Patient very lively today.

INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:


The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reaches

9 Hz. Low voltage awake pattern



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured..


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation was performed at 6:36 AM and did not activate

the record.


Photic stimulation elicited scant driving

SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



EKG: A single lead captured  HR 66 BPM




DAY 4 (03/31/2016, 06:00 -4/01/2016, 10:30)



AEDs: LEV only


Patient very lively today. He concurs that TPM is causing some

sedation

INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reaches


9 Hz. Low voltage awake pattern



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured..



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



EKG: A single lead captured  HR 90 BPM




Impression: This 4 day continuous video EEG monitoring session

with seizure and spike detection identified no epileptiform


abnormalities.  Reduction and a elimination of one of the

patient's seizure medications produced no adverse effects.  In


fact, the patient reported feeling more alert and interactive.


While the absence of epileptiform activity does not exclude the

possibility that the patient's episodes of dyscontrol are in fact


seizures, the study found no evidence to support an active

epileptiform focus at this time.


Occasional disconjugate eye movements are picked up in the eye

leads.
