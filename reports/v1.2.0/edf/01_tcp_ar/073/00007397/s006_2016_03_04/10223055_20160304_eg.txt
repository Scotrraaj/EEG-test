HISTORY:

54 y.o. MALE PRESNTS FOR  FOLLOW UP EEG . PMHX

SIG FOR  ANEURYSM CLIPPING  AND SZ. PT DENIES ANY RECENT SZ.



MEDICATIONS:

NO AEDs



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of very low amplitude alpha and bifrontal beta activity.


A clear posterior dominant rhythm cannot be seen. Excess diffuse

beta is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements and mild diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected. Excess


beta is seen.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG. The absence of a


PDR while rare can be seen in a normal EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

Epilepsy. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the

medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
