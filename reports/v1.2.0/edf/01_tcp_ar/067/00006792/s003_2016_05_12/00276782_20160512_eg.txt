DATE OF STUDY: 05/12/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 40 y.o. female with a history of localization related epilepsy referred for routine
EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


metroNIDAZOLE (FLAGYL) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily for 7 days.

metroNIDAZOLE (METROGEL VAGINAL) 0.75 % vaginal gel, Insert one app hs x5

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 150 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. Indications:
EPILEPSY

folic acid (FOLVITE) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily for 360 days.

budesonide (RINOCORT AQUA) 32 mcg/actuation nasal spray, Inhale 1 spray into the nose daily for
360 days.


meloxicam (MOBIC) 7.5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

hydrOXYzine (VISTARIL) 25 mg capsule,


folic acid (FOLVITE) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.  The patient was very
sleepy, falling asleep in photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Alpha squeak was identified




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: The patient was falling into stage II sleep, no driving response was elicited


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Previous EEGs are not available for comparison at this time.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
