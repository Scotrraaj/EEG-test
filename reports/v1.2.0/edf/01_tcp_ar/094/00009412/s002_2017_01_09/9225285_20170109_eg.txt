DATE OF STUDY: 01/09/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 46 y.o. male with a history of post-traumatic epilepsy s/p gunshot wound to head
(right side). No seizures for years.  Referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL XR) 200 mg 12 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

simvastatin (ZOCOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly for 360 days.


cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) 10 mg tablet,

naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet,

chlorthalidone (HYGROTEN) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


sildenafil (VIAGRA) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth as needed for Erectile Dysfunction.

sildenafil (VIAGRA) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth as needed for Erectile Dysfunction.

benazepril (LOTENSIN) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily for 360 days.


Calcium Carbonate-Vitamin D3 600 mg calcium- 200 unit Capsule, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times
daily.
Diclofenac Sodium (VOLTAREN) 1 % Gel, Apply 2 g topically 4 times daily.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized mixture of alpha and
beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The
normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

Continuous right hemispheric polymorphic slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:



A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Continuous right hemispheric polymorphic slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of right hemispheric dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.
