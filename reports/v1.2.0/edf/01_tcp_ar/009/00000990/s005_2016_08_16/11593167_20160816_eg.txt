HISTORY:

48 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy since the age of 12. She has not had a
seizure in 10 years, but is having symtoms like she is going to have one. Now referred to EEG for
characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, TAKE 2 TABLETS BY MOUTH 2 TIMES DAILY.

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 50 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. Start 1 at bed for 3
weeks, then 1 BID



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.



Frequent focal slowing is present at over the left anterior-to-mid temporal region (F7/T3 max).



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) left anterior temporal (T1>F7/T3 max) sharp waves



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) left anterior temporal (T1>F7/T3 max) sharp waves



2. Frequent focal slowing over left anterior-to-mid temporal region

3. Suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate of a potential epileptogenic focus in left anterior temporal region,
superimposed on left temporal cerebral dysfunction and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
