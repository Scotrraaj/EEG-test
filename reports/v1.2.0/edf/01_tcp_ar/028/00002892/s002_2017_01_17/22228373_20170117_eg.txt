DATE OF STUDY: 01/17/17

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation. The technician noted the patient was
frequently restless and uncooperative, with poorly sustained sleep.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
POSTS, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation was not performed.



Photic stimulation was attempted however the patient began jerking his body synchronously with the
flashing light at 1 Hz. On EEG, there is no clear preceding epileptiform discharge, only jerking
artifact. The technician aborted the procedure.




EVENTS:

See above under



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION / CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.  Photic stimulation was attempted but aborted due
to truncal jerking movements, which had no associated epileptiform activity on EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
