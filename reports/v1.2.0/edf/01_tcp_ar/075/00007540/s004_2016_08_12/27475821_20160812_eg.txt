HISTORY:

35 y.o. female with a history of seizures characterized by staring, referred
for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

pregabalin (LYRICA) 75 mg capsule, Take 2 capsules by mouth 2 times daily. For two weeks then
150 twice a day.


topiramate (TOPAMAX) 50 mg tablet, Take 3 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.

ranitidine (ZANTAC) 300 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 40 mg capsule, Take 40 mg by mouth daily.

alprazolam (XANAX) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 0.5 mg by mouth nightly as needed.


butalbital-aspirin-caffeine (BUTALBITAL-ASPIRIN-CAFFEINE) 50-325-40 mg per capsule, Take 1
capsule by mouth every 4 hours as needed.

Riboflavin (VITAMIN B-2) 100 mg Tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


Zolpidem (AMBIEN) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth nightly as needed.


Albuterol (PROVENTIL,VENTOLIN) 90 mcg/Actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every 6
hours as needed.



SEDATION: meds as above



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and excess of beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. A single burst of 3.5 Hz irregular, generalized, frontally predominant, spike and polyspike-and
wave activity, lasting <1 sec was captured



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

There are runs of midline irregular theta activity over the central region, which may be a benign
variant.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.






HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only 1-hour EEG due to:

1. A single burst of 3.5 Hz irregular, generalized, frontally predominant, spike and polyspike-and
wave activity, lasting <1 sec



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Given the clinical history, these findings are consistent with an idiopathic generalized epilepsy.

Runs of irregular midline theta activity may be consistent with a benign variant.

Excess beta activity can be seen in the setting of a medication effect (such as benzodiazepines,
barbiturates).
