HISTORY:

47 y.o. female with a history of medically

refractory epilepsy, previously defined temporal lobe focus


referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.  She

states that she has been seizure-free for approximately a year

since starting marijuana



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


sertraline (ZOLOFT) 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth daily.

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 200 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2

times daily.


levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH

TWICE DAILY

sodium chloride (OCEAN NASAL) 0.65 % nasal spray, Inhale 1 spray


into the nose as needed for Congestion.




benzonatate (TESSALON PERLES) 100 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by

mouth every 6 hours as needed for Cough.


guaiFENesin (ROBITUSSIN) 100 mg/5 mL syrup, Take 10 mLs by mouth

every 4 hours as needed for Cough.


cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth

every 8 hours as needed for Muscle spasms.

sertraline (ZOLOFT) 50 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.



KEPPRA, TOPAMAX, MEDICAL MARIJUANA



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HVand

photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, slowing of the


posterior dominant rhythm,are seen.


Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: elicits an increase in amplitude



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


Within normal limits awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.
