History:	34 year old woman with a reported history of seizures for ~ 10 years.  Last seizure 
	occurred ~2 years ago. 
	
	Patient is about 3 months pregnant.  Patient has braids, so distances may not be 
	accurate.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal 
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric 
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
	No focal slowing or epileptiform discharges
	Sleep, stage 2
	POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), prominent
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
