HISTORY:

52 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy, break through seizures with low PB level,
referred for EEG monitor for management of seizure exacerbation



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

HYDROmorphone (DILAUDID) injection 0.5 mg

heparin 25,000 units (100 units/mL) in 0.45% sodium chloride 250 mL infusion (Premix)


oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet 1 tablet

zonisamide (ZONEGRAN) capsule 100 mg

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) tablet 60 mgmL


morphine injection 2 mg

morphine injection 4 mg

ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg


docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 1,500 mg



PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) tablet 210 mg

TECHNIQUE:


A continuous video monitor- 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 elec trodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and seizure and spike detector



DAY 1 (-12/13/2016, 20:00)



BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous,  asymmetric,  But increasingly well-organized, and consists
predominantly of beta  with admixed alpha.


Posterior dominant rhythm was  Present. 8.5-9 Hz on the right , 10.5 on the left


The background is reactive,  variable.

There were persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. R focal slowing, however this was
substantially improved by the 14th.


Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. POSTS. Slow wave sleep was not captured..



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Few bursts of delta

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. T2 sharp waves


2. Rare T 1 sharp waves, or sharply contoured slowing

3. Discrete R FC spikes



EVENTS: None


EKG: A single lead captured HR 78 BPM



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:


Focal slowing (better over time) , with R>L sharp waves but no seizures.  Overall, background
improved on the 14th and sharp waves were less prominent, all compatible with resolving post ictal
state.
