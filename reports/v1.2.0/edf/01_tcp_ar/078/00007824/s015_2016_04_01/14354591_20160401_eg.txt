DATE OF STUDY: 04/01/2016

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 47 y.o. WOMAN PRESENTS FOR FOLLOW UP PMHX

SIG FOR SZ. ON 3/22/16 PT SEEN AT OSH DUE TO MULTI SZ ACTIVITY.



MEDICATIONS:



KEPPRA, VIMPAT, ANTRIA


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and


photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left

frontotemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during

drowsiness. At times slightly sharply contoured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Focal slow waves in the left frontotemporal region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

There is frequent focal slowing in the left frontotemporal

region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral

dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
