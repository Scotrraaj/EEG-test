HISTORY:

72 y.o. female with a history of previous seizures, referred for routine EEG for
evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 200 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.meclizine,
(ANTIVERT), ciprofloxacin HCl (CIPRO), desloratadine (CLARINEX), loratadine
(CLARITIN),diphenhydrAMINE (ANTI-ITCH, DIPHENHYDRAMINE,) 2 % cream, baclofen (LIORESAL),
fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray, ketoconazole (NIZORAL) 2 % cream,
naproxen (NAPROSYN), aspirin EC 325 mg EC tablet, mometasone (NASONEX) 50 mcg/actuation
nasal spray, Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, (VITAMIN D-3), lovastatin (MEVACOR) 40 mg tablet,
alendronate (FOSAMAX) 70 mg tablet,




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:







A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of poorly organized low to medium
amplitude and reactive 8-8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). A large amount of low to
medium amplitude frontally predominant 18-25 Hz activity is seen. Moderate amounts of eye blink,
muscle, and EKG artifact are seen.




During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Very brief stage II sleep is characterized by attenuation of muscle artifact and beta activity along with
increased amounts of bilaterally symmetric medium amplitude delta and theta slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 58 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:









This is an mildly abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to mild background disorganization
and slowing of dominant posterior rhythmic activity during wakefulness. These are nonspecific
abnormalities and indicate a mild disturbance of cerebral activity such as that seen with a variety of
mild generalized encephalopathies of various etiologies. No persistent focal slowing, no clinical or
electrographic seizure activity, and no pathologic paroxysmal epileptiform discharges were recorded.
