HISTORY:

62 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy

referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


Lacosamide (VIMPAT) 150 mg Tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times

daily.

losartan-hydrochlorothiazide (HYZAAR) 100-25 mg per tablet, Take


1 tablet by mouth daily.

phenytoin (DILANTIN KAPSEAL) 100 mg ER capsule, 1 in AM 2 at PM

warfarin (COUMADIN) 3 mg tablet, Take 3 tablets by mouth daily.


Or as directed by your Provider

warfarin (COUMADIN) 1 mg tablet, 1 TABLET ONCE A DAY

warfarin (COUMADIN) 5 mg tablet, 1 TABLET ONCE A DAY






SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening. Note that there is very frequent muscle


artifact obscuring frontal leads during wakefulness.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.  Note

that there is very frequent muscle artifact obscuring frontal


leads during wakefulness.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
