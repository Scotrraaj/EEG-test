HISTORY:

68 y.o. man p/w rectal bleeding pt has recent change in mental with in the
past 2 days. He has become more lethargic per nurse along with a right sided gaze.



MEDICATIONS:


Protonix, Reglan, Acetaminophen, Versed -off, Lidocaine, Gabapetin, Ativan


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to marked continuous diffuse muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:







No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Generalized diffuse slowing, moderate to severe



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal obtunded very limited routine EEG due to moderate to severe diffuse
background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators
of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
