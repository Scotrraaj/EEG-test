SEDATION: Haldol, Ativan



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically difficult  record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal  stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by significant muscle artifact.  Underneath the muscle
artifact, there is a somewhat slow, basically theta pattern with a glimpse of an alpha rhythm



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements and diffuse background slowing are seen.  The sleep
pattern is essentially a lower voltage alpha theta pattern with frontal beta





Modest generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.  However, the degree of muscle artifact could obscure subtle findings



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Auditory stimulation produces an arousal.  Snore artifact was noted



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.Irreg, not functioning throughout all sections
of the study



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. generalized background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This EEG is improved compared to the previous study which was somewhat slower.  No epileptiform
features were identified in either study.  This record support a by hemispheric disturbance of cerebral
function, as can be seen in toxic or metabolic encephalopathy





Attending Epileptologist: 


I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
