HISTORY:

88 y.o. female with a history of suspected complex partial seizures referred for routine
EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


FUROSEMIDE PO, Take  by mouth daily.

levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

Diaper,Brief, Adult,Disposable (DEPEND EASY FIT UNDERGARMENTS) Misc, SIZE LARGE.  Use as
directed

Underpads Pad, Use as directed

levothyroxine (SYNTHROID, LEVOTHROID) 50 mcg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) 17 gram packet, Take 17 g by mouth daily.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:





A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically challenging
record, with periods of muscle artifact affecting the right hemispheric channels. The study included a
single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with fragments of a symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present but suboptimal.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

There is frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing.

Note that the right hemispheric channels are frequently obscured by muscle artifact, limiting
interpretation of this region for parts of the study.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal, somewhat limited, awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:

1. Suboptimal organization


2. Frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of left temporal cerebral dysfunction (either structural or
physiologic in etiology) superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Note that interpretation of
the right hemispheric channels was limited for parts of the study.
