HISTORY:

40 y.o. MAN WITH A HX OF SZ. WITH RIGHT /

LEFT SIDE VP SHUNT. PT WAS PLACED ON LAMOTRIGINE WHICH PER PT


MOTHER STOPPED HIS GTC SZ. PT NOW HAVING

BECOME TENSE IN HIS ARMS, FOLLOWED BY CRYING. THESE EPISODES LAST

10 SECONDS PER MOTHER.




MEDICATIONS:

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2


times daily.

clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 1 mg disintegrating tablet, Take 1 tablet

by mouth at bedtime.


valproic acid (DEPAKENE) 250 mg capsule, Take 2 capsules by mouth

every 8 hours.

valproic acid, as sodium salt, (DEPAKENE) 250 mg/5 mL Solution,


Take 10ml every 6AM, 7.5ml every 11AM, 7.5ml every 5PM, 10ml




every 11PM.

metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 25 mg 24 hr tablet, 12.5 mg daily.


Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystal (MACRODANTIN) 50 mg Capsule,

NYSTOP 100,000 unit/gram Powder.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a low

amplitude semi organized symmetric mixture of beta frequencies,


with a  9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is

present. Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is

present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.




During limited drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements,


attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm,

and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:




Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are 4 clinical episodes in which the patient complains of

having a seizure and feeling dizzy. During the episodes he was

able to follow motor and verbal commands. He did become emotional


and cried for seconds at the end.  There was no electrographic

correlate to the events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

1. Diffuse slowing, mild.


2. Four episodes of dizziness with no EEG correlate.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of mild diffuse background


slowing. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral

dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. The episodes


described above had no EEG correlate as such they may be part of

a simple partial seizure which only had a EEG correlate 25% of

time or alternatively this may be due to non-epileptic/

behavioral etiology.
