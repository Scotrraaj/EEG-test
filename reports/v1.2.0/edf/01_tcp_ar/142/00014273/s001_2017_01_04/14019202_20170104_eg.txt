DATE OF STUDY: 01/04/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 72 y.o. female with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 250 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.


omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 40 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth 2 times daily (before meals).

montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth nightly.

ketotifen (ZADITOR) 0.025 % ophthalmic solution, Place 1 drop into both eyes as needed.


cetirizine (ZYRTEC) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth as needed.

pravastatin (PRAVACHOL) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for
Pain.





No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Patient remains awake throughout the recording.


Frequent polymorphic theta and delta activity at higher amplitudes is captured over the left anterior
temporal region.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:



A heart rate of ~72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  The rhythm appears to be paced with
occasional regularly appearing QS complexes.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Frequent mild left anterior temporal focal slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly
structural in origin.



No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
