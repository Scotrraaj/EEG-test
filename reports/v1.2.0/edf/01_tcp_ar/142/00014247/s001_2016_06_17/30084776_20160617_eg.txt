HISTORY:

49 y.o. female with a history of renal failure and sepsis found with tongue
biting and lacerations, referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change and
evaluation of myoclonus (irregular right foot twitching and also body jerks).




MEDICATIONS: FENTANYL, VASOPRESSIN, NOREPINEPHRINE, EPINEPHRINE



SEDATION: as above


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous and symmetric but poorly organized and consists of mostly delta with
admixed theta. There is no clear reactivity, variability, or state change.





There is severe diffuse slowing.


There is no focal slowing.



Background limitation is somewhat affected by breathing artifact (diffuse delta wave with
superimposed fast activity that matches breathing on video), every 2-2.5 seconds.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

Myoclonus is not reported.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Severe diffuse slowing and disorganized background


2. Tachycardia


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

Tachycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.
