SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. Excess 5-7Hz activity is seen in
wakefulness.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Mild generalized slowing is present.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal (left > right) region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent bursts (less than 2 seconds in duration) of symmetric frontal predominant generalized spike
and wave at 4Hz are seen. None with a clinical correlate.






OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Fast generalized spike and wave

2. Intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal (left > right) region


3. Mild diffuse slow


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to generalized spike and wave discharges
which are seen in generalized epilepsy. In addition there is intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
anterior temporal (left > right) region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific. Lastly there is mild diffuse background slowing and disorganization.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
