DATE OF STUDY: 07/11/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient ICU


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, COMA





HISTORY:

 a 31 y.o. MAN FLOWN IN FROM OSH, VICTIM OF MVA WITH MULTIPLE
LACERATIONS.


MEDICATIONS:

NOREPINEPHRINE




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by a disorganized
delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Periodic generalized frontal predominant epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) with a triphasic
morphology seen. These frequently increase in frequency and appear to evolve consistent with
generalized seizures.

Multiple seizures are seen lasting ~ 1-2 min.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

The patient was having eye twitching during the record but it was difficult to visually correlate with
the activity seen on EEG.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 180 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Status epilepticus, with generalized seizures


2. GPEDs


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a very abnormal EEG due to generalized status epilepticus. In addition there is evidence of
moderate to diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology. Patient will
be placed on LTM. Primary team was informed of findings.
