START DATE OF STUDY: 07/11/16 at 4 PM

END DATE OF STUDY: X



RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:

EEG TYPE: long term monitoring


HISTORY:

a 31 y.o. male with a history of TBI, s/p MVA, with difficult intubation in the field.
Initial CT demonstrated evidence of anoxia.  Initial EEG compatible with status epilepticus.
Patiently subsequently coded after that EEG.  Now intubated, comatose with preserved brainstem
signs.  Referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current outpatient prescriptions on file: Klonopin, Effexor, gabapentin, naltrexone

ICU:  Epinephrine, vasopressin, nor unasyn, phenytoin, cephazolin, PRN Ativan



SEDATION: Ativan PRN



TECHNIQUE:

A  Bedside portable  channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-
20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and  Tactile  Stimulation.  Seizure and spike
detections upper was utilized.  The patient was not hypothermic.  T max 104 Ventilator artifact is
present.






DAY 1 (07/11/2016 4 PM,  - 7/12/2016, 14:00)



BACKGROUND:

The EEG begins immediately post code.  At that time overall background is low voltage and
featureless.  There is scant, definitive cerebral activity if any.  Initially, there is some ICU artifact and
some movement artifact.  Briefly, there is some low voltage delta and theta in the frontal regions on
the evening of the 11th.  As the recording continues, by 2 PM in the afternoon, the EEG is markedly
low voltage suppressed with paucity of muscle artifact, Tactile stimulation did not activate the record.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



EVENTS: None



EKG: A single lead captured HR 138 BPM


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

Marketed suppression of cerebral activity, which is in fact declining over the course of this recording

DAY 2 (07/12/2016, 14:00 - 7/13/2016, 09:00)


MEDICATIONS:

ICU:  Epinephrine, vasopressin, norepinephrine unasyn, phenytoin, cephazolin,

BACKGROUND: No significant change.  The record is progressively more suppressed with rare, if any,
isolated delta waves.  Ventilator artifact was noted.  Tactile stimulation of the patient does not
produce a change in the otherwise suppressed pattern.  Eye movements and other artifacts of head
and neck stimulation were elicited





GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change






PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None


EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 114




DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


This 48 hour bedside portable continuous video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for an
increasingly suppressed, nonreactive EEG pattern.  These findings may be placed in the appropriate
medical context for this individual with posttraumatic brain injury and anoxic insult.
