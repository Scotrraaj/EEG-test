HISTORY:

71 y.o. WOMAN WITH MEMORY DIFFICULTIES /

CONFUSION. PER PT FOR A LONG TIME NOW.

Soln, Take 1 each by mouth as needed.

simethicone (GAS-X) 80 mg chewable tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth


4 times daily as needed for Flatulence.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.
