HISTORY:

54 y.o. male with a history of anoxic injury

referred for routine EEG for as an evaluation for electrocerebral


silence.


MEDICATIONS: none listed



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system and utilized a NicOne system. This was


a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel

of EKG and EMG.  The study was analyzed at a sensitivity of 2

microvolts per millimeter with electrodes at double distances


using an electrocerebral silence montage.  Technician tapped each




electrode to ensure system integrity.  Core temperature was

measured at 97.7 F.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is suppressed, without discernable cerebral

rhythms.  There is no reactivity to noxious stimulation

(including loud verbal stimulation, sternal rub, and application

of Q-tip to nasal cavity). There is no variability nor is there


state change.



Profound generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured


during this study.



HEART RATE: A heart rate of 80 bpm is captured on a single EKG

lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal EEG, performed in accordance with ACNS

guidelines for electrocerebral silence, due to:


1. Profound cerebral dysfunction, with absence of cerebral

rhythms, and lack of reactivity


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of profound cerebral

dysfunction.


Cerebral rhythms are not detected.
