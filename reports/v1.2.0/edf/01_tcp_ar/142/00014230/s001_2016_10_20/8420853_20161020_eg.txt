TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically   satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation. There is a lot of muscle in the
background and patient seems anxious.  She has continuous orofacial movements.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.3 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. There is generous beta.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric and spiky vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Prominent beta in stage 2 sleep.



No generalized slowing is present.  Rare left temporal focal slowing is present in drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving with supra-harmonic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

EEG within normal limits for adults of this age.  In adults of this age, infrequent temporal slowing is
permitted.  This patient's continual chin tremor contributes to artifact in this record.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
