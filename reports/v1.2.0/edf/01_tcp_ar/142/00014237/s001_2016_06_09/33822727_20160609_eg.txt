TECHNIQUE: A bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND: The background is characterized by the presence of a continuous symmetric mixture of delta and theta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive pattern. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle activity, agitation and some beta During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Moderate generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE: A heart rate of 104 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to: 1. generalized background slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific but supported by hemispheric disturbance of cerebral function. If epilepsy is important consideration a follow-up study may be considered when the patient is more cooperative. Given the muscle artifact, subtle focal features may be under recognized
