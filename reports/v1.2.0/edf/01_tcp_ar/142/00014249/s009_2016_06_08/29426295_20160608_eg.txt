HISTORY:

68 y.o. female with a history of seizures secondary possibly to limbic encephalitis.




MEDICATIONS:


Topamax, Keppra, Phenobarbital


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.





The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic moderate amplitude theta>>delta activity.



During very brief drowsiness, there is increase in the amount of delta activity seen.



Continuous subtle polymorphic delta activity is seen over the right, primarily over the right temporal/
temporoparietal region.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


A single event of a sensation


HEART RATE:


An irregular heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and briefly drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate diffuse slowing

2. Focal right temporal- temporoparietal slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.

Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion.


An episode of
