DATE OF STUDY: 04/28/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy



THIS EEG REPORT IS A SECOND ATTEMPT.  THE FIRST REPORT CAN NOT BE FOUND.



HISTORY:

a 68 y.o. female with a history of crescendo seizures characterized by Begin with
aura of nausea.


She can talk, eyes closed and R eye twitches, left arm goes limp or goes rigid.  referred for routine
EEG for treatment of status epilepticus.



MEDICATIONS:


Keppra




SEDATION: Ativan


TECHNIQUE:


STAT bedside portable  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using
the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The  background on the LEFTis characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture
of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  The right is
relatively normal. The RIGHT hemisphere is remarkable for continuous temporal slowing, disrupted
alpha, and nearly continuous rhythmic theta>delta, with sharply contoured theta and L temporal
sharp waves.







No generalized slowing is present.

Right  focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) T2, T4

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, stimuli.




EVENTS:


There are clinical / electrographic events captured during this study.  The patient is initially able to
answer questions but is a bit slow. Her husband notes



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120-140 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Irreg



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. R temporal lobe complex partial status epilepticus, with preserved language.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are diagnostic for a focal epilepsy. Clinical features fit with anatomical localization.
The team was informed and the patient goes on to EEG monitoring.
