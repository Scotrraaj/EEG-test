History:	74 year old man with progressive cognitive decline.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of 8 Hz low-to-moderate amplitude theta activity with 
expected AP gradient.  Mild excess of polymorphic theta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the 
background slows to diffuse polymorphic theta and, occasional, delta activity.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
does not produce additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of <60 bpm
 and rare premature QRS complexes with subsequent pauses.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
	No epileptiform discharges
	No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding 
is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No epileptiform
 discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
 sleep recording may provide additional information.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of
 <60 bpm and rare premature QRS complexes with subsequent pauses.
