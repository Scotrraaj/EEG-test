 HISTORY:

64 y.o. female with a history of  posttraumatic epilepsy since childhood, severe
panic attacks referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

alprazolam (XANAX) 1 mg tablet, TAKE one half tablet THE morning, AND one whole tablet AT
bedtime. MAY TAKE another half during THE DAY needed FOR SEVERE anxiety


ARIPiprazole (ABILIFY) 20 mg tablet, 1 tablet by mouth every morning

carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) 200 mg tablet,


levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) 75 mcg tablet,

sertraline (ZOLOFT) 50 mg tablet, TAKE ONE TABLET DAILY

metFORMIN (GLUCOPHAGE) 500 mg tablet,


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet,

Others

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz  40 uV posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
There is prominent, diffuse beta activity noted throughout





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  The beta activity becomes more
vigorous


Sleep is not sustained


No generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:




Photic Stimulation: Did not activate the record



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. marked excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with the use of barbiturates or benzodiazepines.
They can also be seen in the context of anxiety.  No epileptiform features were noted.
