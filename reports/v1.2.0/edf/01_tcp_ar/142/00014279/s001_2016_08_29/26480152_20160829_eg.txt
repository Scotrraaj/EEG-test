DATE OF STUDY: 08/29/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 42 y.o. MAN WITH NEW ONSET SZ. 2' LACTIC ACIDOSIS.  PMHX: MIGRAINES,
ANXIETY symptoms for 11 years



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:

OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) tablet 300 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg


ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:



A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG .




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F8/T2>F7/T3 region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional right (F8/T4) anterior temporal sharp waves can be seen.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Occasional right anterior temporal sharp waves


2. Independent bilateral anterior temporal (right more than left) focal slow


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to occasional right anterior temporal sharp
waves which are indicative of potentially epileptogenic focus in that region. In addition there is
intermittent Independent bilateral anterior temporal (right more than left) focal slow waves.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
