HISTORY:

21 y.o. female with a history of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia who
was found down after unknown time, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS: no AED



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a somewhat technically
challenging record as the patient continually moves around in bed. The study included a single
channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:








The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and an excessive
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 114 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal, somewhat limited, awake only routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic
events reported or detected.

Excess beta activity can be seen in the setting of a medication effect such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.


Tachycardia is seen on a single EKG lead.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

Excess beta activity can be seen in the setting of a medication effect such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.


Tachycardia is seen on a single EKG lead.
