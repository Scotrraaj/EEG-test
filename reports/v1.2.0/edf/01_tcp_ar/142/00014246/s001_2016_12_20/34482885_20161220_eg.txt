HISTORY: 48 y.o. male with a history of cirrhosis, now in hepatic coma with involuntary movements, referred for EEG for assessment of psychosis and ICU monitoring. Patient had received multiple AEDS and anesthetic agents, with refractory involuntary movements which stopped with ketamine just before the EEG was started.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: DOPamine (INTROPIN) 800 mg/250 mL (3,200 mcg/mL) in D5W infusion lactulose (CHRONULAC) 20 gram/30 mL solution 40 g lactulose retention enema phytonadione (vitamin K1) (AQUA-MEPHYTON) injection 10 mg DOPamine (INTROPIN) 400 mg/250 mL (1,600 mcg/mL) infusion sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB hydrocortisone sod succinate (Solu-CORTEF) injection 50 mg vasopressin (PITRESSIN) 100 Units in dextrose 5 % in water 250 mL infusion pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg sodium bicarbonate 150 mEq in dextrose 5 % in water 1,000 mL infusion EPINEPHrine (ADRENALIN) 2 mg in dextrose 5 % in water 250 mL infusion phenylephrine (NEO-SYNEPHRINE) 160 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL infusion sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN) 1 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+ rifAXIMin (XIFAXAN) tablet 550 mg norepinephrine (LEVOPHED) 16 mg/250 mL (64 mcg/mL) in NSS infusion SEDATION: Ketamine, propofol, others   TECHNIQUE: A bedside portable 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.  This patient was recorded for more than 2 hours but only the 26 bedside baseline is available.  The patient died on the day of recording.  BP (!) 79/31  Pulse 76  Temp (!) 103.2 °F (39.6 °C) (Axillary)  Resp 20  Ht 1.778 m (5' 10")  Wt 124.7 kg (274 lb 14.6 oz)  SpO2 94%  BMI 39.45 kg/m2  DAY 1 (12/20/2016, 08:21) BACKGROUND: The waking background is very low voltage, continuous, markedly suppressed with delta/scant theta and ventilator artifact.  Posterior dominant rhythm not present. The background is not reactive, or variable. There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. By 9 AM EEG is replaced with artifact.  The patient receives CPR at 10:38- the EKG lead flattens and EEG is replaced with artifact.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: see above  EKG: A single lead captured 80 BPM  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal abbreviated ICU EEG due to: Nearly suppressed cerebral pattern, with absence of reactivity or variability followed by loss of cerebral activity and then CPR artifact This report was revised when the final piece of data was uploaded to the network
