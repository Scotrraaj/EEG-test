HISTORY:

54 y.o. male 54 y.o. WITH HX OF SZ, HTN,

ALCOHOL ABUSE, IDDM, CHRONIC BACK PAIN. PRESENTS TO ED WITNESSED


SZ X 4.



MEDICATIONS:


LISINOPRIL, METOPROLOL, AMLODIPINE, THIAMINE, FOLIC ACID,

THERAGRAN, DILANTIN




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


This EEG recording was performed with 23-channel bipolar EEG

connection, including all standard 10-20 electrode placements as

well as T1 and T2.   Recording was at a sampling rate of 200


samples per second per channel.






EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is consists of a mixture of delta more than

theta discharges. There is a diffuse excessive but mainly


bifrontal beta activity. There is no normal anterior-to-posterior

gradient and the posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) is absent. T



Sleep is not captured




The is Intermittent focal slowing present independently in the


bilateral anterior temporal regions.



PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

______________________________________________






IMPRESSION:

1. Focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal regions.


2. Diffuse slow




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a abnormal asleep only EEG due to focal slowing in the


bilateral anterior temporal regions, which is indicative of focal

cerebral dysfunction and non-specific with regards to etiology.


In addition there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction

which is also non-specific with regards to etiology.
