History:	42 year old woman with a history of seizures since childhood.
Medications:	Tegretol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a low amplitude 9.5-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
Nearly continuous low-to-moderate polymorphic sharply contoured theta activity is present in the 
left temporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse 
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, left temporal, mild-to-moderate
	No epileptiform discharges
	No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 21-minute EEG due to nearly continuous sharply contoured 
focal left temporal focal slowing. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in the left 
temporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If 
clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
