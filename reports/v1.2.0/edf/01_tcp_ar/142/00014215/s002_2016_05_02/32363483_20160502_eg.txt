HISTORY:

47 y.o. male with a history of seizures referred for routine EEG for evaluation of
paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


Levetiracetam 750 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr, Take 750 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet,



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 50-60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a NORMAL awake and asleep 1 hour EEG.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

A normal EEG does not rule out the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
