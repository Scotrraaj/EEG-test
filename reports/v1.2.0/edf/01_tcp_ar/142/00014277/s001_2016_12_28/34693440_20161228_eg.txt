sodium chloride 0.9 % IV bolus


insulin regular 100 units in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm is present.



The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen.



There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording.




This EEG was not performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology
Society for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or
tactile stimuli.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1. Isoelectric EEG.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an isoelectric EEG not performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the determination of
electrocerebral inactivity.  This finding is indicative of severe cortical dysfunction which may be due
at least in part to marked medication effect but can also be seen in the setting of diffuse hypoxic
injury.
