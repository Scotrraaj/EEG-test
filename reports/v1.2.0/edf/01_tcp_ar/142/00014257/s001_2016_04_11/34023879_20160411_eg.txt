HISTORY:

28 y.o. MAN FOUND DOWN AT GAS STATION WITH

ALTERED MENTAL STATUS. ? SHAKING. GIVEN UP TO 8 MG OF ATIVAN IN


THE ED TO HLP AGITATION.


UDS - OPIATES, WET, PCP



MEDICATIONS:

Ativan



SEDATION: Ativan



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically




limited record due to almost continuous movement artifact and

included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was

characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity

with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies.



Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also


seen.


Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal limited awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate to sever diffuse slowing


2. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha


rhythm are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to

severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication

effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Please note


again that this is a limited study due patients continuous

movement.
