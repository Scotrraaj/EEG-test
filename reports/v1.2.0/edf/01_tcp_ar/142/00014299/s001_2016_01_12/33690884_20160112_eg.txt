HISTORY:

51 y.o. female with a history of Down

syndrome and epilepsy as well as dysphagia referred for routine


EEG for characterization of seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


pantoprazole (PROTONIX) 40 mg tablet,

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.

simvastatin (ZOCOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth nightly.


carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) 200 mg tablet, Take 200 mg by mouth 3

times daily.

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take  by mouth 3 times


daily.


SEDATION: None






TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized symmetric mixture of alpha, theta, and beta

frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior


dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient

of frequency and amplitude is present.


Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces scant symmetric photic driving,

which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of mild diffuse cerebral

dysfunction.
