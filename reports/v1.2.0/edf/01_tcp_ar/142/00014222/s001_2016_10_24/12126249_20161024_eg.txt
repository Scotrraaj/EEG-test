HISTORY:

66 y.o. FEMALE ADMITTED FOR ANOXIC INJURY CODED 4 X TIMES.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

ipratropium (ATROVENT) 0.02 % nebulizer solution 0.5 mg


methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (Solu-MEDROL) injection 40 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % IV bolus

insulin regular 100 units in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion


EPINEPHrine (ADRENALIN) 2 mg in dextrose 5 % in water 250 mL infusion

albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 5 mg

piperacillin-tazobactam (ZOSYN) 4.5 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB MB+


phenylephrine (NEO-SYNEPHRINE) 160 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL infusion

norepinephrine (LEVOPHED) 16 mg/250 mL (64 mcg/mL) in D5W infusion


[START ON 10/25/2016] famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg



SEDATION: none noted.


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm is present.



The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen.



There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording.


There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or
tactile stimuli.




This EEG was not performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology
Society for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:



A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal coma routine EEG due to:


1. Electro-cerebral silence


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an isoelectric EEG which was not performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the
determination of electrocerebral inactivity.  This EEG reveals severe cortical dysfunction which may
be due to anoxic injury or alternatively seen as part of a medication/sedative effect.
