HISTORY:

47 y.o. male with a history of bipolar disease,

prior SDH, admitted after reported ingestion. Subsequently, in


the ED he became hypotensive and hypothermic and somnolent;

referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Depakote, Seroquel, others



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation. Prior




left craniotomy.  Burr holes noted on the left.



EEG BACKGROUND:



Patient is excessively drowsy. The study mostly captures stage II

sleep with POSTs and vertex waves and spindles.


Superimposed breach rhythm in the left central-parietal region.



Noxious stimulation produces an alerting with 9 Hz alpha rhythm


bilaterally.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and asymmetric vertex waves (left) , sleep spindles


and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.


Focal slowing is present during sleep (P3, C3 mixed delta/theta)



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare P3 sharp waves were identified.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed. Tactile stimuli produces an arousal.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG.

1) Rare P3 sharp waves


2) Focal slowing (P3, C3)

3) Breach rhythm left central-parietal region.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

1. Rare sharp waves Focal slowing are in the region of the prior

craniotomy. Hypersomnolence can be ameliorated by noxious


stimuli.
