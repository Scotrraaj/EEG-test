HISTORY:

81 y.o. male with a history of several jerking arm movements and speech arrest
for a few minutes, referred for routine EEG for possible seizure.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs
every 6 hours as needed for up to 360 days.


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

bisoprolol (ZEBETA) 10 mg tablet, Take 0.5 tablets by mouth daily for 360 days.


omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, 1 CAPSULE 2 TIMES A DAY -1/2 HOUR BEFORE FOOD

umeclidinium (INCRUSE ELLIPTA) 62.5 mcg/actuation Disk with Device, Inhale 62.5 mcg into the
lungs daily.


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of poorlyorganized symmetric left median
voltage 6-8 Hertz posterior activity over central and posterior scalp regions, reactive to eye opening
and closing. Low voltage frontocentral beta activity was seen. A large amount of eye blink and
muscle artifact was seen, obscuring portions of the underlying cerebral electrical activity.




During drowsiness, runs of frontally predominant medium voltage 1.5-3 Hz activity were seen along
with slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm,
and diffuse background slowing.




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.






HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 56 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild to moderate diffuse background slowing during wakefulness.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific and indicating mild to moderate bihemispheric functional disturbance
such as that seen with a variety of diffuse or multifocal encephalopathies. No clinical or
electrographic seizures were recorded.
