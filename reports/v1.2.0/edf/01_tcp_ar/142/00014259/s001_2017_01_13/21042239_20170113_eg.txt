DATE OF STUDY: 01/13/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 19 y.o. female, now 6 months pregnant, with a history of syncope, referred for
routine EEG for evaluation of possible seizure disorder as a cause of her syncopal episodes.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

docusate sodium (COLACE) 100 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily as needed for
Constipation.

PNV62-FA-om3-dha-epa-fish oil (PRENATAL GUMMY) 400 mcg-35 mg -25 mg-5 mg Tablet,
Chewable, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


nitrofurantoin, macrocrystal-monohydrate, (MACROBID) 100 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth
daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric low amplitude
frontocentral beta activity is seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
