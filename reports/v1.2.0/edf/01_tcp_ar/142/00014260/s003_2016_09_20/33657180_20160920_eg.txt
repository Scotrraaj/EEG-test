HISTORY:

66 y.o. female with a history of DOUBLE LUNG TRANSPLANT 8/2016, WITH
CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS AND COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING CVA, referred for routine EEG
for assessment of mental status change.




MEDICATIONS: XANAX, TADALFIL, LETAIRIS, PREVACID, VALCYTE, CELLCEPT, PROVENTIL,
LOPRESSOR, CELEXA, SYNTHROID, PROGRAF



SEDATION: meds as above



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:






The waking background is symmetric and reactive but poorly organized and consists of delta and
theta with admixed beta. There is no posterior dominant rhythm.  There is frequent bitemporal
independent polymorphic delta slowing.




Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by further background slowing, with attenuation of theta
frequencies and increase in delta and beta. No sleep transients are seen.



There is moderate generalized slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


An irregular heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Frequent bitemporal independent polymorphic slowing


3. Tachycardia, irregular heart rate


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a bitemporal cerebral dysfunction
superimposed on a moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
