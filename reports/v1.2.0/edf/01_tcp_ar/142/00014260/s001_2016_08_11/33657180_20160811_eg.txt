DATE OF STUDY: 08/11/16

SEDATION: Fentanyl, propofol, Versed

Also Vec



TECHNIQUE:

A  1hour bedside ICU Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  Pt is intubated




EEG BACKGROUND:

The  background is characterized by the presence of a low voltage, suppressed pattern with slow
featureless delta, smaller amounts of theta on the left and generous artifact. Severe generalized
slowing is present.


Despite artifact, R  focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:




None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: No tests of reactivity (visual, auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli) are
performed.




EVENTS:


There are no lectrographic events captured during this study.

Intermittent writhing movements of right shoulder were seen

HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal ICU 1 hour routine EEG due to:

1. Marked background slowing more prominent on the right



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with pharmacologic coma or diffuse CNS insult.
Although there are technical limitations, this is an asymmetric record which should be correlated with
neuroimaging. No seizures were seen.
