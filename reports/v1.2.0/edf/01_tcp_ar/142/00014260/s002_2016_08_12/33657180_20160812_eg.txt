SEDATION: as above



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is continuous but asymmetric.



The left hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of theta, and delta, with admixed alpha.

The right hemisphere consists of a disorganized attenuated mixture of theta and delta.



There is spontaneous muscle artifact from biting, and this artifact is also elicited during noxious
stimulation. At times this activity breaks up into what appears most consistent with spikey muscle
artifact; however there is no cerebral reactivity to noxious stimulation.






Severe generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

The camera is pointed towards the patient's right side - the left arm is not clearly seen. With each
breath, the patient's chest rises, then the left side of the body depresses into the bed, then there is an
exhalation. There is no corresponding cerebral ictal activity on EEG.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal coma study EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing, with background disorganization and lack of reactivity

2. Continuous slowing over the right hemisphere


3. Movements of the left side, described above, without associated cerebral ictal activity


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of right hemisphere cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in
etiology, superimposed on a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. The movements described above,
suboptimally captured on video, are not associated with cerebral ictal activity.
