DATE OF STUDY: 04/28/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 28 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy, MRI with small rounded lesion within the

cortical and subcortical region of the superior posterior left


parietal lobe that measures approximately 4 to 5 mm in diameter referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

SUBOXONE 8-2 mg Film,


amitriptyline (ELAVIL) 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth nightly.

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth at bedtime.

Buprenorphine-Naloxone (SUBOXONE) 8-2 mg Subl, Place  under the tongue. One and one half
daily

Suboxone, Atrovastatin, Amitriptyline, Tegretol No current facility-administered medications for this
visit.



SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically challenging
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and limited photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is poorly organized characterized by symmetric mixture of alpha theta and
beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The
normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present, but not prominent.
Shifting slowing is seen



Mu may be present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, and diffuse background slowing are seen. Drowsiness
with snoring resembles the wake record.




Modest generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: is limited


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Reg


IMPRESSION:




This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Background slowing and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific and support a diffuse CNS process.  Medications may play a role. To
better define epileptiform activity consider a 1 hour EEG.
