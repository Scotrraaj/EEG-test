END DATE OF STUDY:07/01/2016



RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Epilepsy Monitoring Unit

EEG TYPE: Long term recording





HISTORY:

a 28 y.o. man with history of sz. He had a seizure once after he stopped drinking at
the age of 24 and since then continues to have them. Now mainly nocturnal. Also complains of
having issues with his left leg while walking. He is admitted to the EMU for differential diagnosis of
the nocturnal events.



Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;





- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.





MEDICATIONS:


CLONAZEPAM 1 mg bid


SEDATION: None



DAY 1 (6/27/2016, 11:55 - 6/28/2016, 08:00)



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left parieto-occipital region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



     Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and
produces no effect.



     Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not
produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


There is intermittent focal slowing in the left parieto-occipital region.

Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:


Interictal Findings:

Left occipito-parietal focal slowing seen intermittently



Ictal Findings:

The patient had no clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the
epilepsy monitoring unit.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Possible focal vs Psychogenic events



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Unclear.



CONCLUSION:

 was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG.
This was an unrevealing EMU monitoring session because of no typical events were captured. On the
last day the patient felt anxious and wanted to leave.




The interictal EEG is characterized by intermittent left parieto-occipital focal slow waves.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.



The patient was weaned off clonazepam over the course of his admission. He was restarted on his
medication on the day of discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes were made
during the hospitalization.




The patient had a discussion with  about the possibility that these are nonepileptic
events and their association with underlying psychiatric co-morbidities.






Patient is follow-up with .



I have personally reviewed and interpreted this study, and this report represents my findings and
conclusions.
