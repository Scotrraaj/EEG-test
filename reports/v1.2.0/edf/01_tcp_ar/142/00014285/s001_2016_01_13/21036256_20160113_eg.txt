History:	45 year old man who presents with episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Topamax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal 
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
  During brief stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and 
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.  
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at 
multiple flash rates.  A regular heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
	No epileptiform discharges
	Sleep, stage 2, brief
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 28-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and very briefly asleep. The lack of epileptiform
 discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
