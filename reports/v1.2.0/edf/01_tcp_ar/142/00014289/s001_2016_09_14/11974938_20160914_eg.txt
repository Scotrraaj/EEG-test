This was a technically limited record record due to an intermittent rhythmic artifact seen most over the right hemisphere and obscuring at times it evaluation. Multiple attempts were made to fix it.  The record included a single channel of EKG.  9:45:23 AM intubating  10:44:57 AM incision  12:12:55 PM asking for 5000 heparin  12:21:54 PM clampped  12:48:17 PM 00:00 clamp is off right  12:54:58 PM 00:00 unclampped  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.   Sleep is not captured  At baseline Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right mid-temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  After the patient is intubated there is a diffuse background slow waves that improve in frequency depending on the level of anesthesia and BP. The intermittent right midtemporal focal slow waves are seen. In addition new right mid-temporal focal sharp waves are seen intermittently.   After clamping no clear change is seen in the background and after clamping no clear change is seen in the background.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Intermittent sharp waves during anesthesia on the right mid-temporal region.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: 1. Intermittent right midtemporal focal sharp waves seen during anesthesia 2. Right mid-temporal focal slowing 3. No change during clamping 4. Frequent rhythmic artifact   CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an uneventful IOM 4.5 hrs EEG (limited by artifact) during a right CEA. There were intermittent right midtemporal focal sharp waves seen during anesthesia which are of unclear significance on a patient with no reported history of seizures. There is also intermittent focal slowing in the right mid-temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. These findings were communicated to the operating team.
