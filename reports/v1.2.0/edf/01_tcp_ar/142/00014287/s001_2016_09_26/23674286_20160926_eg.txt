HISTORY:

49 y.o.  RH WOMAN WAS SITTING IN LIVING ROOM WHEN SHE LEANED
FORWARDED AND HAD A MIDLINE EYE GAZE BEFORE EPISODE SHE WAS NAUSEOUS. THIS
LASTED 8-10 SECONDS AND WAS UNRESPOSIVE PER DAUGHTER.  HX OF COILED ANEURYSM
AND A LEFT VPS.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily for 360 days.

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

chlorthalidone (HYGROTEN) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily for 360 days.

aspirin EC 325 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 325 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours as needed for
Pain.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to a diffuse EKG artifact in all electrodes but mainly the left fronto-temporal one. There study
included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.



Continuous  polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontal region during wakefulness with a
focal increase in amplitude consistent with a breach.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Continuous focal slowing in the left frontal region and breach


2. Tachycardia


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine very limited EEG due to continuous focal slowing in
the left frontal region and breach. This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in
this region and consistent with the shunt in the left frontal region. Please note that the marked EKG
artifact impeded a complete evaluation of the left frontal region. If clinically desired a repeat EEG
with sleep may be beneficial in elucidating epileptiform abnormalities.
