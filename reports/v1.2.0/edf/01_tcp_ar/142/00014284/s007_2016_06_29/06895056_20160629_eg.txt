RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: 

EEG TYPE: EMU


REPORT



HISTORY:

53 y.o. right handed male


Epilepsy Type: unclear - suspected focal based on L temporoparietal cavernoma, but bifrontal spikes
on EEG




Seizure Type:

complex partial with secondary generalization:

Seizure in his sleep. He appeared confused and was snoring/sweating in the early morning - normally
he wakes up easily if she nudges him. But she didn't see the seizure itself - they were both asleep.





Taking Dilantin ER 300 mg qhs. Not taking consistently at same time.



Neuroimaging:




MRI brain +/-c:

1. Redemonstration of a lesion in the left temporoparietal region measuring up to 1.0 cm with signal
characteristics consistent with a cavernous malformation. No associated AVM or DVA is present.


2. No evidence of stenosis, dissection, or aneurysm within the cervical or intracranial vasculature.


Personally reviewed; HCTs also reviewed



Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Recording of seizures for both classification and if focal
presurgical evaluation.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:


- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patientÂ’s exam

There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service




CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.






MEDICATIONS:


No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None


DAY 1 (6/27/2016, 10:13AM - 6/28/2016, 08:00)



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.




PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:



One CPS 2nd T-C seizure at 11:31AM



EEG: There a diffuse theta discharge that rapidly settles over the left frontal and then later mid
temporal region with an evolving high amplitude delta sharp wave discharge. Seizure last 8 minutes.




CLINICAL: While in bed sleeping would intermittently move around was not tested. After minutes
suddenly has versive movement of the head to the right while right arm is dystonic with the left arm
tonic and intermittent jerks, followed by bilateral arm tonic posturing and a T-C convulsion that slows
down. Last ictal jerk on the left.






HR: Increases from the 60's to the 90's





DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

1. Single seizure likely with left hemispheric onset.

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

In sleep there are intermittent low amplitude spikes with a large field maximal over the left frontal
region.




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

1. At 16:04 PM the patient pushes the button while in bed. When questioned he states he feel cold
and that is what he feel prior to a seizure.



EEG: During the episode there is a normal awake background. Later had no recollection of the
episode.


2. At 19:38 while sitting on the side of the bed the patient start fluttering his eyes and slumps back in
the bed unresponsive with eyes closed. He is asked verbal and motor commands but remins
unresponsice with no movement for about 9 minutes.



EEG: During the episode there is a normal awake background.




3. One CPS  seizure at 12:39AM



EEG: Arouses from sleep there is muscle artifact and about  9 seconds later a left hemisphere frontal
maxiamal delta discharge is seen which evolves to theta then suddenly stops. After the seizure end it
appears to show diffuse slowing. Seizure last 53 seconds. Minutes after some left temporal focal
slowing is seen.




CLINICAL: While in bed sleeping would intermittently move and touch his face. Patient is asked are
you ok at the end of the seizure and he states



HR: Increases from the 60's to the 90's





SEIZURES/EVENTS:


There are one push button with no EEG correlate and a single focal seizure from sleep with likely left
laterarlization.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:

Interictal Findings:



In sleep there are intermittent low amplitude spikes with a large field maximal over the left frontal
region.


Rare left fronto temporal spikes are seen.



Ictal Findings:

The patient had Two seizures and two clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG
monitoring in the epilepsy monitoring unit.


One cps with secondary T-C and one CPS both likely arising from the left hemisphere.

He also had two nonepileptic events.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. CPS

2. Non-epileptic events



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Localization related epilepsy



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 3 days with continuous video EEG.



The interictal EEG is characterized by left frontal and rare left fronto temporal epileptiform activity as
well as seizure likely arising from the left hemisphere, which indicate a potentially epileptogenic
focus in that region.




He was started on Tegretol on the day of discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.



After this data is acquired she will be presented at surgical conference to discuss the possibility of
intracranial monitoring / electrocorticography as a next step in her surgical evaluation.



Patient is follow-up with  at the  as an outpatient.



I have personally reviewed and interpreted this study, and this report represents my findings and
conclusions.
