HISTORY:

52 y.o. male with a history of heart failure, hepatitis C.  Patient found down,
unresponsive with severe hypoglycemia.  Multiple seizure-like spells identified.  Now, referred for
EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Not provided


Home medicines include insulin, metformin, aspirin, Coumadin


SEDATION: Ativan 6 mg initially low dose 0.5 mg Versed


TECHNIQUE:


A bedside portable continuous 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile  stimulation.






DAY 1 (07/19/16  - 7/20/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND:


The overall background is low voltage, slow.  Initially, it is a low voltage, featureless pattern.  As time
goes on, lower voltage beta and alpha frequency activity is identified.  Tactile stimulation produces
an alerting with some delta and movement artifact. Later on, stimulation produced higher amplitude
delta.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


EVENTS:


The patient went to MRI scan at 9 PM. Afterwards, EEG was obscured by artifact and the last section
was  Uploaded to the network later



EKG: A single lead captured HR 108 BPM


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

Replacement of normal background with low voltage slow pattern, but with more alpha and beta by
the end of the recording.


No seizures

No epileptiform activity


Limited study- loss of electrode integrity intermittently
