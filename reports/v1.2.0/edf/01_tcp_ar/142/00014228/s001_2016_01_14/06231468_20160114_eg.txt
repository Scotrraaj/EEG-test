HISTORY: A 65-year-old woman who underwent a lung transplant 8 days ago. During physical therapy today, nurse was concerned about seizure versus syncope.
MEDICATIONS: Propofol, Keppra, heparin, pantoprazole.
INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient was intubated and sedated during the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern, consistent with pharmacologic coma. There is a mixed frequency pattern rich in beta and faster frequency activity as well as theta. There is intermittent attenuation noted in the record. Shifting asymmetries are observed in the
�•. \�9ord with a bit more beta in the right frontal region and shifting slowing noted in the section when the
             'EEG suddenly attenuates.  The left temporal and the right central region seem to have a bit more

Heart rate 112 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Technically clinically challenging record, but remarkable for:
	•	Initial mixed frequency pattern with intermittent attenuation suggestive of pharmacologic coma.
	•	Shifting asymmetries noted in the background.
	•	With elimination of the Propofol, more continuous pattern, but still with shifting arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were seen; no epileptiform features were identified. This report should be placed in the appropriate clinical context with this patient's comorbidities.
