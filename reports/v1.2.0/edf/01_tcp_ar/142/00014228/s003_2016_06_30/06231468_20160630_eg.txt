START DATE OF STUDY: 06/30/16 at 16:17 END DATE OF STUDY: 07/01/2016 at 12:00  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 66 y.o. WOMAN PRESENTS  WITH 3 EPISODES OF SZ GTC. S/P LEFT LUNG TRANSPLANT ON 1-6-16.  MEDICATIONS: Keppra  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record at time due to marked movement artifact and included a single channel of EKG.  DAY 1 (06/30/2016, 16:17 - 7/1/2016, 12:00)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by disorganized diffuse high voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  There is right hemisphere continuous polymorphic slow waves are present, with higher amplitude and at times faster frequencies consistent with a breach. .   Stage changes are noted with some spindles seen ate times.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Intermittent P4 sharp waves were noted at times in runs.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile stimuli produces an arousal  EVENTS: There are  no clinical or events captured during this study.    HEART RATE: A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION:  1. Right parietal sharp waves 2. Continuous right hemisphere focal slow waves and breach. 3. Generalized slow waves   DAY 1 CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 19.5 hours EEG due to the presence of a epileptogenic focus in the right parietal region.  In addition there is also continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin. Lastly, there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.    Reading attending:
