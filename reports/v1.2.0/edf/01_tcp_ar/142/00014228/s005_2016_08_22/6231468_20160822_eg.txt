DATE OF STUDY: 08/22/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 66 y.o. Woman PRESENTS  S/P LEFT LUNG TRANSPLANT ON .
PT WITH CC OF SEIZURES.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

aspirin (BAYER) tablet 325 mg

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg


atovaquone (MEPRON) suspension 750 mg

cycloSPORINE modified (NEORAL) capsule 100 mg

labetalol (NORMODYNE) tablet 100 mg


magnesium chloride (MAG 64) DR tablet 64 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 20 mg

predniSONE (DELTASONE) tablet 10 mg


valGANciclovir (VALCYTE) tablet 450 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL



sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg


heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

mycophenolate (CELLCEPT) capsule 500 mg


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 1,000 mg



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

On the left hemisphere, the waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized
mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The
normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere, maximum at F8/T4 region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximum at anterior temporal region.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This finding of continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximum at anterior temporal
region is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin,
consistent with the known stroke.
