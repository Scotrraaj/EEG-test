DATE OF STUDY: 06/30/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep





HISTORY:

a 66 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy, MCA aneursym, Multifocal right
frontal encephalomalacia and gliosis. Lung transplant s/p 3 TC this AM  referred for routine EEG for
treatment of status epilepticus.




MEDICATIONS:

Keppra, many others




SEDATION: ativan



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and tactile  Stimulation. This Bedside portable record has
artifact



EEG BACKGROUND:



The background is diffusely slow, poorly organized with theta and delta frequencies. R sided breach
is noted.



Moderate generalized slowing is present.


R sided focal slowing is present, with higher amplitude, c/w breach. .


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Periodic delta is seen on the right, particularly R FC and CT.  This waxes and wanes with some bursts
of rhythmic theta. The muscle artifact in the background confounds this.

T6 and P4 sharp waves were noted.


The Rhythmic activity builds up and then stops brielfy at 12:50:44 and 12:54


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile stimuli produces an arousnal


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or  events captured during this study.  The patient is poorly arousable with a
face mask



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Slow background

2. Periodic delta, with rhythmic theta building up on the right, but no definitive seizures


3. T6 P4 sharp waves


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a highly epileptogenic focus.  Due to the artifact, subtle ictal
patterns may have been overlooked. This patient will go on to EEG monitoring.




Attending Epileptologist: 


I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
