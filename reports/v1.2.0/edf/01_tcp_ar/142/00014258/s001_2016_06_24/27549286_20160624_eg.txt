DATE OF STUDY: 06/24/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 68 y.o. female with a history of stroke, HTN, referred for routine EEG for
possible seizures.



MEDICATIONS: ASA, Lovenox



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.






During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by synchronous and symmetric spindles and K complexes.


No generalized slowing is present.


There is frequent right temporal polymorphic slowing and occasional independent left temporal
polymorphic slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) right fronto-temporal (F8/Fp2/F4) spikes

2. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) left fronto-temporal (Fp1/F7>T1) spikes


3. Occasional (>1/10 s to <1/min) right anterior temporal (T2>F8/T4) sharp waves


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Frequent right temporal polymorphic slowing

2. Occasional independent left temporal polymorphic slowing

3. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) right fronto-temporal (F8/Fp2/F4) spikes


4. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) left fronto-temporal (Fp1/F7>T1) spikes

5. Occasional (>1/10 s to <1/min) right anterior temporal (T2>F8/T4) sharp waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:





These findings indicate the presence of multifocal epileptogenic potentials superimposed on right >
left bitemporal cerebral dysfunction.





Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
