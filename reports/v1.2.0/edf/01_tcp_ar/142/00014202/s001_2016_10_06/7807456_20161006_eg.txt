HISTORY:

75 y.o. female with a history of HTN, DM, HLD, CKD, CAD, OA s/p L knee
replacement who presents with 1 day of altered mental status. Patient was reportedly found at home
with urinary/fecal incontinence and altered mental status. Patient was brought into the ED, where
there was some concern of a possible R facial droop and L sided weakness, as well as confusion and
slowed speech. She was referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.





MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


dextromethorphan-guaiFENesin (ROBITUSSIN DM) 10-100 mg/5 mL syrup 10 mL

heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 10 mg

aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg


rosuvastatin (CRESTOR) tablet 10 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg



cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN) 1 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a somewhat disorganized symmetric
mixture of theta, alpha, and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7.5 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present. There are occasional shifting bursts of slowing noted in wakefulness and drowsiness left >>
right.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep: Although stage 2 sleep was not identified, questionable REM sleep was noted at the end of
the record. Muscle monitor was not utilized to confirm this.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Shifting focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. The rhythm was irregular.



IMPRESSION:




This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Slowing of the alpha rhythm


2. Mild disorganization

3. Shifting slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are non-specific in adults of this age. This pattern can be seen in a toxic or metabolic
encephalopathy. The presence of REM sleep in a routine 20-minute EEG may suggest an underlying
sleep deficit. No epileptiform features were seen.
