HISTORY:

19 y.o. woman hx of seizures since 4 months old. Last seizure was last night.
Patient has about 1 seizure a week. PMHx: Polycystic Kidney Disease, Tubler Sclerosis



MEDICATIONS:

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.






SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
systemwith T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.






HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake only  1 Hr EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  1 Hr EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
