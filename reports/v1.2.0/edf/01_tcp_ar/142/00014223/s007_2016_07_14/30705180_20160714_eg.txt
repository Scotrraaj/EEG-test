HISTORY:


84 y.o. female with a history of advanced dementia, epilepsy.  Admitted with
seizure followed by aspiration referred for EEG for treatment of status epilepticus.



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra, antibiotics

SEDATION: None initially, then Midazolam



TECHNIQUE:

Continuous video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-
20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and  Stimulation.  Seizure and spike detection software
was utilized.  She was intubated and poorly responsive.

DAY 1 (07/13/2016, 10 AM - 7/14/2016, 06:00)



TECHNICAL:  The EEG machine was shut down briefly at 11 PM. The data from 11 PM to 8 AM can
not be retrieved as of 07-15-2016


BACKGROUND:

The overall background is medium amplitude, mixed frequency with theta and smaller amounts of
beta,



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Intermittent sharp waves are noted independently from the right or left
temporal region with variable maximum including left mid or posterior temporal and right posterior
temporal.



EVENTS:  Intermittent runs of periodic complexes maximum in the left hemisphere were noted.
These periodic discharges have frequency evolution and often a clear start and stop.  These have a
generous field of spread in the left central temporal and posterior temporal region.


There is intermittent left central 11 Hz activity noted without clear frequency evolution.

Over the course of 7/13 patient starts phenytoin and seizures start to spread out.


Variable ictal patterns, with periodic or periodic and clearly evolving pattern.

Localization: posterior temporal maximum.

Seizure duration: 1-15 minutes


Seizure free periods- by 10 PM has prolonged periods without seizures with theta background.


EKG: A single lead captured



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:


Status epilepticus with recurrent focal seizures.

This pattern was discussed with the clinical team.





-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 2 (7/14/2016, 08:00 - 7/15/2016, 06:00)


Meds: PHT, LEV, later Versed- 3 to 4 mg/hour .

BACKGROUND: No change




GENERALIZED SLOWING: no change - theta background.



FOCAL SLOWING: No change



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) noted when patient not seizing

Intermittent sharp waves are noted independently from the right or left temporal region with variable
maximum including left mid or posterior temporal and right posterior temporal.




EVENTS:onging seizures, maximum T5 with variable durations- 1-17 minutes. T5 periodic sharp
waves 0.5 to 1.75 Hz with clear evolution and sometimes clear start or stop.

Sometimes associated with tremor in R hand. Patient otherwise intubated and unresponsive.



EEG pattern improved somewhat with additional phenytoin with longer seizure free intervals.

Versed was added on the evening of 7/14 which blunted but did not entirely stop the seizures.



EKG: A single EKG lead captured 80 BPM

As discussed with the clinical team on 7/14 and 7/15 this is a refractory and worrisome pattern which
is refractory to pharmacotherapy.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 3 (07/15, 06:00 - 7/16/2016, 06:00)

Meds: PHT, LEV, Versed-  4 mg/hour .


BACKGROUND: longer seizure free periods in the PM on 7-15


GENERALIZED SLOWING: in comparison to prior days, the overall pattern became lower voltage
and more featureless, prior to Midazolam reduction



FOCAL SLOWING: sections with theta on the left, and attenuated pattern on the right



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Occasional (1/hour to <1min)  To Frequent (>1/min to
<1/10s) Left posterior temporal or P3 as well as R mid temporal

Brief, 7-10 second bursts, trains of periodic sharp waves seen, mostly or sometimes exclusively on L
but occ Bilateral, L max.


EVENTS: slower periodic discharges- P3 maximum with 0.5-2 Hz



Duration 1 -17 minutes duration. Report of R hand trembling with some



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 64 BPM




DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

As reported to the team, seizures initially more blunted, shorter.  Longer seizure free period, but also
a drop in amplitude and a slower pattern, occurring in the setting of stable AED therapy.


Periodic activity more blunted, slowing in periodicity.  Longer seizure free intervals were noted early
in this epoch, but ictal patterns recur later.


These results were communicated to the clinical team at the time of service.



-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 4(07/16, 04:00 - 7/17/2016, 09:33)


Clinical: The patient was made DNR with plans for hospice care


Medications: PHT, LEV. Midazolam was discontinued.

BACKGROUND: no change



GENERALIZED SLOWING: no change

FOCAL SLOWING: no change, more attenuated on the right



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): No change


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: isolated sharps less prominent


EVENTS: electrographic discharges of 2-9 minutes duration, from T5 P3, without clear clinical
correlate in this intubated poorly responsive patient. They can end abruptly and EEG transitions to
theta pattern. Some briefer 7-10 second bursts



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 84 BPM




DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION





Following cessation of Midazolam, in the context of withdrawal of care and transition to hospice level
care  for this elderly woman with advanced dementia, the epileptiform bursts were increasing in
comparison to the the evening of the 15, AM of the 16.


EEG recording was discontinued as part of step down of care.

IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Overall: Initially, phenytoin did seem to slow the seizures. Stable doses of midazolam was partially
effective in treating this highly refractory pattern.  However, the overall amplitude of the EEG began
to drop.
