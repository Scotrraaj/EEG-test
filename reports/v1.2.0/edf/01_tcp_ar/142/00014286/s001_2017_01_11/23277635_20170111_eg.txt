DATE OF STUDY: 01/11/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 81 y.o. male with a history of change in mental status, found covered
in vomit and urine.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

terbinafine (LAMISIL) tablet 250 mg

ampicillin (OMNIPEN) 1 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB


vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+

cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN) 2 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL







SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.


Mild excess of polymorphic theta activity is seen.



During very brief drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the
posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


An irregular heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Very mild diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.



An irregular heart rate is captured on a single EKG.
