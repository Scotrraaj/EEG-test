HISTORY:

44 y.o. male with a history of

Schizophrenia, DM, HTN, IVDA referred for routine EEG for


evaluation of paroxysmal events. Auditory and visual

hallucinations.  Black magic.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

LISINOPRIL PO, Take  by mouth.


insulin regular (HUMULIN R,NOVOLIN R) 100 unit/mL injection,

Inject  into the skin 3 times daily (before meals).

Dilantin, Ativan, Seroquel, Haldol, cogentin


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.


SEDATION: none






TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



Sleep is not sustained; drowsiness included slow rolling eye

movements.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric

background slowing.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical

or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
