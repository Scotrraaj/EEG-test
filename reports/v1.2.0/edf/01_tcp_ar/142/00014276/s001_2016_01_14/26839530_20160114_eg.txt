HISTORY:

36 y.o. female with a history of IVDA,


myositis, epilepsy referred for routine EEG for characterization

of seizures.

SZS X15 YRS. LAST SZ 4/15 DUE TO STOPPING MEDS. SCREAM/ LOC/ GTC


WITH SOMETIMES TONGUE BITE. POST CONFUSED AND TIRED.   PMHX:

SUBSTANCE ABUSE , ANXIETY, abscesses, LEG INJ

MEDICATIONS:


Carbamazepine, Neurontin, Baclofen, CLONIDINE, others




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the




International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG HV, and photic stimulation. The

patient was restless.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is somewhat poorly organized but relatively

symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and


generous of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by


a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm

(PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.

At times the alpha is higher amplitude on the left, and there are

lambda waves.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  POSTS are

asymmetric, more notable on the left


Focal slowing is present: See HV below. In addition, in stage I


sleep there is left occipital 4 Hz activity



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: elicits bilateral slowing but more

sustained 4 Hz activity, Left temporal maximum



Photic Stimulation: elicits bilateral driving



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is abnormal  routine EEG.


1. Poorly organized background

2. Mild excess theta


3. Mild excess beta

4. Subtle focal features in the left hemisphere.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This awake and asleep routine EEG supports a diffuse CNS process.

Medications may play a role. Subtle focal features may be


correlated with imaging. .
