DATE OF STUDY: 04/29/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only





HISTORY:

a 78 y.o. female with a history of R temporal epilepsy in setting of R
meningioma s/p removal on 4/25/2016, referred for EEG for evaluation of persistent altered mental
status while undergoing reduction in phenobarbital.




MEDICATIONS: Vimpat, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, VPA


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background consists of disorganized theta and delta which is not clearly reactive.


There is continuous polymorphic slowing, frequently with superimposed fast frequencies, noted over
the right posterior temporal region, consistent with a right breach rhythm.





Evidence of state change is not captured.


Severe generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) right temporal (T4 max, but with broad field extending to right
hemisphere) spike and wave discharges



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing and background disorganization without reactivity


2. Continuous right posterior temporal polymorphic slowing

3. Superimposed fast frequencies over the right posterior temporal region, consistent with a breach
rhythm


4. Frequent right temporal spike and wave discharges


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of right temporal epileptogenic discharges superimposed on
right posterior temporal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.


A right posterior temporal breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known history of craniotomy.
