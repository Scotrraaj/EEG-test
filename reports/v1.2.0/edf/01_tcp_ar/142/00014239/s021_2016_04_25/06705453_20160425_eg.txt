START DATE OF STUDY: 04/25/16 at 16:13 END DATE OF STUDY: 04/27/2016 at 08:48  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 78 y.o. female with a history of R temporal epilepsy in setting of R meningioma s/p removal on 4/25/2016, referred for EEG immediately post op for bilateral facial twitching.  MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Vimpat, Phenobarbital, Depakote  SEDATION: None listed  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (4/25/2016, 16:13 - 4/26/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND:  The background is a continuous mixture of disorganized delta and theta with admixed faster frequencies. These frequencies are higher in amplitude and sharply contoured over the right temporal region. The background demonstrates variability; there are periods of relatively less delta and more alpha that alternate with periods of more diffuse delta and less alpha.  There is no clear reactivity. There is severe generalized slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Frequent right temporal sharp waves; at times these reflect over the left temporal region  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s   DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Continuous background but without clear reactivity. Severe generalized slowing. Right temporal breach rhythm. Frequent right temporal sharp waves.    -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (4/26/2016, 06:00 - 4/27/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Frequent right temporal (T4/T6 max) sharp waves; at times these reflect over the left temporal region. Rarely these become periodic at 0.5-1Hz for runs < 20 seconds.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured an irregular heart beat.   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Background unchanged from day 1. Right temporal sharp waves still noted; rarely they are periodic (lateralized periodic discharges / PLEDs / LPDs). An irregular heart beat is seen on a single EKG lead.   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (4/27/2016, 06:00 - 4/27/2016, 08:48)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Frequent right temporal (T4/T6 max) sharp waves; at times these reflect over the left temporal region. Rarely these become periodic at 0.5-1Hz for runs < 20 seconds.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured an irregular heart beat.   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Background unchanged from days 1-2. Right temporal sharp waves still noted; rarely they are periodic (lateralized periodic discharges / PLEDs / LPDs). An irregular heart beat is seen on a single EKG lead.   -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Severe generalized slowing with lack of clear reactivity 2. Right temporal breach rhythm. 3. Frequent right temporal sharp waves that rarely become periodic   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of right temporal epileptogenic potentials (that rarely highly epileptogenic) superimposed on severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. A right temporal breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known history of craniotomy. There are no clinical/electrographic seizures reported or detected during this study.
