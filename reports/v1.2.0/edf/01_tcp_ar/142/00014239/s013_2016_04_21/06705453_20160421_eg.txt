HISTORY: 78 y.o. female with a history of a right frontal meningioma s/p gamma knife radiation in 2013, parkinsonian features, HTN, DM, and arthritis, referred for EEG for evaluation of new onset seizures: left gaze deviation and left sided movements.  MEDICATIONS: Keppra VPA PHT Lacosamide  SEDATION: None documented  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  **NOTE: This report describes the second half of a prolonged recording that began on 4/13/2016 15:22.  The findings from 4/13/2016 15:22 till 4/18/2016 05:59 are described in a separate report.  DAY 6 (4/18/2016, 06:00 - 4/19/2016, 06:00)  VPA 1000 mg q8h PHT 100 mg q8h Lacosamide 200 mg in AM, 200 mg in PM Phenobarbital load 5 mg/kg q4-6h begun afternoon on this day  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, reactive, poorly organized, and asymmetric. The left hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of mostly theta with admixed alpha and delta. There is no posterior dominant rhythm. The right hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of theta and delta with admixed alpha. There is no posterior dominant rhythm.  Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by further slowing of the background. Sleep transients are not seen.  There is moderate generalized slowing. There is continuous right hemispheric polymorphic slowing.  Study is disconnected on 4/18/2016 from 15:41-15:59 as patient is transferred to neuro ICU.  Intubation occurs at 16:31 and is associated with brief diffuse background attenuation. Following intubation and initiation of phenobarbital load, the background slows to a disorganized mixture of delta and theta, then mostly delta with occasional admixed beta. At this point, there is no definite reactivity or state change.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Continuous right temporal (T4 max) polyspikes +/- slow wave (LPD+F / +/- LPD+FR), with broad field extending into right hemisphere, occurring ever 0.5-1 Hz.  These persist after intubation and initiation of phenobarbital load.  EVENTS: Several seizures are captured: 4/18/2016 at 06:10, 08:09, 10:40, 14:09, 16:25 (duration: 1 min 30 sec, up to 3 min 12 sec) CLINICAL: at times, these electrographic seizures are associated with brief left head deviation, mouth opening, intermittent guttural/groaning noises, and/or lip smacking beginning at least ~20-40 sec after electrographic onset EEG: right temporal LPD+FR develop increasing underlying rhythmic delta then break up into sharply contoured theta, then sharply contoured delta with admixed spikes, with spread to the right hemisphere.  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate paced at 80 bpm  DAY 6 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate generalized slowing and background disorganization, which worsens to severe generalized slowing after initiation of phenobarbital load 2. Continuous right hemispheric polymorphic slowing 3. Right temporal LPD+FR 4. Right temporal seizures, last noted 4/18/2016 at 16:25  These findings are consistent localization related epilepsy of right temporal origin. There is additional evidence for moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, worsening to severe generalized slowing, likely due to medication effect. There is additional evidence for right hemispheric dysfunction. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 7 (4/19/2016, 06:00 - 4/20/2016, 06:00)  VPA 1000 mg q8h PHT 100 mg q8h Lacosamide 200 mg in AM, 200 mg in PM Phenobarbital load (20 mg/kg total) completed, level 27 Versed got started  BACKGROUND:  Continuous with mostly delta with admixed beta Around 4/19/2016 22:45, the background develops a burst suppression pattern. Burst consist of 2-4 seconds of sharply contoured theta. Suppression lasts 10-30 seconds.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: severe  FOCAL SLOWING: continuous right hemispheric slowing becomes less noticeable as background slows  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Continuous right temporal LPD+FR at 0.5 Hz. At times the associated right temporal delta activity fluctuates without definite evolution for periods < 10 seconds After the background becomes burst suppression, R temporal epileptiform discharges are no longer continuous but are abundant (>1/10 sec).  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s-80s.   DAY 7 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION 1. Background slowing (severe) at least in part attributable to medication effect (phenobarbital loading)  2. Right temporal highly epileptogenic discharges persist, but no definite electrographic seizures. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 8 (4/20/2016, 06:00 - 4/21/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: burst suppression pattern. Bursts consist of 2-4 sec of disorganized theta with admixed R temporal sharp waves. Periods of suppression last 7-10 seconds.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: severe  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Frequent right temporal sharp waves  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in 70s-80s   DAY 8 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Burst suppression pattern. Frequent right temporal sharp waves. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 9 (4/21/2016, 06:00 - 4/22/2016, 06:00)  Versed wean begun 4/21/2016 ~16:00  BACKGROUND: As the versed wean is begun, the background gradually becomes discontinuous, emerging from a burst suppression pattern. Periods of discontinuity are briefer over the right temporal region, which consists of fluctuating rhythmic delta activity and abundant right temporal sharp waves.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in 70s-80s   DAY 9 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change compared with day 8. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 10 (4/22/2016, 06:00 - 4/23/2016, 06:00)  Versed wean completed ~4/22/2016 16:00  BACKGROUND: Discontinuous as on Day 9. As the day progresses the background becomes nearly continuous, with disorganized delta, theta, and occasional alpha.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: severe   FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: very frequent right temporal sharp waves persist  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s   DAY 10 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Discontinuous background. Right temporal sharp waves persist. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 11 (4/23/2016, 06:00 - 4/24/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: Gradually becomes continuous over the course of the day, consisting of mostly theta and delta with admixed faster frequencies.   By 4/24/2016 02:00 the record is noted to be variable, with periods of alpha and beta alternating with delta and theta.  Note that T4 electrode is affected by artifact from 4/23/2016 06:34 until 4/23/2016 10:26, rendering evaluation of this region suboptimal during this time.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: Severe  FOCAL SLOWING: Abundant quasi-rhythmic right temporal delta slowing for runs <6 seconds  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: frequent right temporal sharp waves  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s   DAY 11 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Continuous background that becomes variable as day progresses. Frequent right temporal sharp waves.  No electrographic seizures. Limited interpretation from 4/23/2016 06:34-10:26. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 12 (4/24/2016, 06:00 - 4/24/2016, 10:34)  BACKGROUND: variable, with periods of alpha and beta alternating with delta and theta  GENERALIZED SLOWING: severe  FOCAL SLOWING: Abundant quasi-rhythmic right temporal delta slowing for runs <6 seconds  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Occasional right temporal sharp waves  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s   DAY 12 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Continuous background with variability. No clear reactivity/state change. Severe generalized slowing. Abundant very brief runs of right temporal quasi-rhythmic slowing. Occasional right temporal sharp waves. -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Electroclinical seizures of right temporal origin noted to persist until 4/18/2016 16:25 2. Right temporal highly epileptogenic discharges that decrease in prevalence over course of study 3. Right temporal slowing 4. Background slowing, the degree of which correlates with medication effect   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are diagnostic for localization related epilepsy of right temporal origin. There is evidence for right temporal dysfunction, likely structural in etiology. There is additional evidence for diffuse cerebral dysfunction. This worsens over the course of the study, correlating with administration of sedating medication, and improves by study end as sedating medication is down titrated.
