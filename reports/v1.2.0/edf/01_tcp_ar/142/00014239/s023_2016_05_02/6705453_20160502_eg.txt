SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is disorganized and characterized by diffuse slowing in the theta and delta
ranges. This is perhaps more prominent over the right hemisphere.  A clear posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR) in not seen.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


There are intermittent sharp waves seen over the right hemisphere maximal at F8-T4. Clinical or
electrographic seizures were not detected.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.





Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 80-90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a ABNORMAL awake and drowsy routine EEG due to diffuse bihemispheric slowing and
intermittnet sharp waves over the right hemisphere. There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy routine EEG.


Sharp waves have epileptiform potential. Diffuse slowing may be seen in toxic-metabolic
encephalopathy or in diffuse brain injury.
