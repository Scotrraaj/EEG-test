DATE OF STUDY: 09/13/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only




HISTORY:

a 39 y.o. female with a history of pulmonary HTN awaiting lung
transplant, with previous prolonged EEG monitoring study, now off phenobarbital and sedation for a
few weeks, now referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change: patient was
unresponsive.



MEDICATIONS: DILAUDID, PROGRAF, FENTANYL, HEPARIN



SEDATION: none


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record
due to near continuous muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


Nearly the entire study is obscured by diffuse muscle artifact, despite administration of Ativan.





During very brief periods of attenuated muscle artifact, the background consists of disorganized mixed
frequencies (alpha, theta, delta, beta). There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm. Tech notes that
patient follows commands, but the background is obscured by muscle artifact and a so clear
assessment of electrographic reactivity is difficult.




Mild-moderate generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

Tech notes a left arm tremor during the study. On video an irregular waxing-waning fast tremor with
left arm flexion/extension is seen.


Interpretation of the background is limited by muscle artifact during periods of tremor.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal, very technically limited, awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Left arm tremor captured on video, noted during periods when the EEG is affected by diffuse
artifact

CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Left arm movement appears most consistent with tremor based on semiology; however, EEG
interpretation is limited by artifact during this time.
