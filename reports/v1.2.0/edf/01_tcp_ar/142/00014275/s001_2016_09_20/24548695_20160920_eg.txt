HISTORY:

90 y.o. female with cc fall and change in ms.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse
disorganized delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

There are continuous sharp waves at O2 that increase and decrease in frequency form 1-2 hz to 8Hz
at times with frank evolution and more anterior spread to P4 and even T4/C4. Clinically the patient
appears to have left gaze deviation and head movement along with the increase in discharges. This
is consistent with continuous focal seizures and status epilepticus.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

See above.





HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Right occipital focal status epilepticus

2. Moderate to severe generalized slow waves.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to right occipital focal status epilepticus. In
addition there is moderate to severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
