SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient was intubated, with fluctuating periods of lethargy and mild arousal. Following painful
stimulation, arousal response was noted with slight eye opening, muscle artifact, and irregular low
voltage 5-7 Hz activity predominantly seen over central, temporal and posterior scalp areas. Low
voltage anteriorly predominant beta activity was also seen. With drowsiness, attenuation of muscle
artifact and increased low to medium amplitude 3-5 Hz generalized slowing were noted. During
portions of the tracing, attenuation of faster frequency activity and increased irregular low to medium
voltage delta activity was seen along with slow waves phase reversing at the vertex or paracentral
region, likely indicative of brief periods of stage II sleep.







No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Diffuse background slowing and voltage attenuation.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate a bihemispheric functional disturbance such as that seen with a variety of
generalized encephalopathies of various etiologies. No clinical or neurological seizures and no
paroxysmal epileptiform discharges were recorded.
