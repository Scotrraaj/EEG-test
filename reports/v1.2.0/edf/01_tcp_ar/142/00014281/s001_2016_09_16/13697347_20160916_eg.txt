DATE OF STUDY: 09/16/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep




HISTORY:

a 81 y.o. male with a history of CAD s/p 2 stents, CHF with eF 40% with ICD,
Mild aortic stenosis, HTN, HLD, Chronic venous insufficiency and lumbar radiculopathy who is
presenting with bacterial meningitis and has increased lethargy last night and today.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


acyclovir (ZOVIRAX) 700 mg in dextrose 5 % in water 100 mL IVPB

dexamethasone (DECADRON) injection 10 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion


metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) injection 2.5 mg

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 2.5 mg in dextrose 5 % 50 mL IVPB

allopurinol (ZYLOPRIM) tablet 300 mg


aspirin EC tablet 81 mg

finasteride (PROSCAR) tablet 5 mg

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) capsule 100 mg




lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 20 mg

tamsulosin (FLOMAX) 24 hr capsule 0.4 mg


cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN) 2 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+

ampicillin (OMNIPEN) 2 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB


vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB MB+

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  very challenging EEG due to continuous muscle artifact and included a single channel
of EKG and verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by continuous muscle activity and diffuse theta in the 5-6 Hz
range.  This is a low voltage and diffusely slow EEG.  Posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) could not be
determined. When awake atient demonstrates continuous trembling and movement of arms and legs
on the video recording.  Athetoid movements



During drowsiness, the muscle artifact drops out and the EEG transitions from a theta pattern to a
theta delta pattern


Stage II sleep is not captured

Generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: None performed



EVENTS:

There are is trembling and continuous movement of arms and legs noted in the video.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 114 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Diffuse theta in the 5-6 Hz range without a clear PDR.


2. Low voltage and diffusely slow EEG



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are nonspecific and indicate general cerebral dysfunction but do not show any
underlying epileptiform discharge.
