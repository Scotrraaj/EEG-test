START DATE OF STUDY: 09/20/16 at 5:18PM END DATE OF STUDY: 09/21/2016 at 01:16PM  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 81 yo male being treated from bacterial meningitis. pt was more lethargic last night and today. PMH of CAD s/p 2 stents, CHF with eF 40% with ICD, Mild aortic stenosis, HTN, HLD, Chronic venous insufficiency and lumbar radiculopathy p/w weakness  f/u eeg  MEDICATIONS: Facility-Administered Medications Ordered in Other Visits: ampicillin-sulbactam (UNASYN) 3 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB MB+ aspirin EC tablet 81 mg lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 5 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg metoprolol tartrate (LOPRESSOR) tablet 75 mg vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+ white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg allopurinol (ZYLOPRIM) tablet 300 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.    DAY 1 (09/20/16, 05:18PM - 9/21/2016, 01:16PM)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Intermittent diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag. These are no longer seen after 4AM.   Sleep was not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured 96 and irregular   DAY 1 IMPRESSION  This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate diffuse slow waves and transient triphasic waves.   CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
