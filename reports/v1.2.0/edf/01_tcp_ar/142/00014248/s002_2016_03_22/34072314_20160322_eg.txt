START DATE OF STUDY: 03/22/2016 at 09:52 END DATE OF STUDY: X  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: long term monitoring  HISTORY: a 115 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy on phenobarbital and Dilantin referred for routine EEG for management of seizure exacerbation and assessment of mental status change; after a prolonged convulsion she was noted by the examining resident to be A&Ox2 but intermittently staring.  MEDICATIONS: loaded with Dilantin; Ativan  SEDATION: as above   TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (3/22/2016, 09:52 - 3/22/2016, 20:31)  BACKGROUND, EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY, EVENTS: The record opens to the pattern previously noted on the routine EEG: an ongoing seizure which consists of diffuse spike/polyspike and wave activity evolving in frequency between 3-5 Hz and evolving in amplitude, most well developed over the bilateral parasagittal regions, at times evolving better over the right temporal region.  By 10:00, spike/polyspike-wave activity gives way to a fairly organized mixture of sharply contoured alpha and excess beta activity with bursts of quasi-rhythmic delta. Frequent diffuse, frontally predominant spike/polyspike activity is present. In drowsiness and sleep, there is increase in theta followed by delta activity as the background slows. Abundant bursts of frontally predominant polyspike activity followed by beta buzzes persist. There are additionally frequent right fronto-temporal (F8 max) spike-wave discharges with a broad field.  Diffuse seizures consisting of spike/polyspike and wave activity evolving in frequency and amplitude is again noted as follows: 12:26 (duration: 1 min) 12:41 (duration: 1 hr 5 min) 13:48 (duration: 53 sec) 13:51 (duration: 1 min 59 sec) 13:53 (duration: 31 sec) 17:26 (duration: 1 min 25 sec)  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 80s.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Diffuse seizures as noted above 2. Abundant diffuse spike/polyspike-and-wave discharges  3. Frequent right fronto-temporal (F8 max) spike-wave discharges with broad field 4. Mild to moderate background slowing with suboptimal organization   DAY 2 (3/22/2016, 20:31 - 3/23/2016, 08:00AM)  BACKGROUND, EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY, EVENTS: The record opens to the pattern previously noted on the routine EEG: an ongoing seizure which consists of diffuse spike/polyspike and wave activity evolving in frequency between 3-5 Hz and evolving in amplitude, most well developed over the bilateral parasagittal regions, at times evolving better over the right temporal region.  Background consists of a semi-organized mixture of sharply contoured alpha and excess beta activity with bursts of quasi-rhythmic delta. Frequent diffuse, frontally predominant spike/polyspike activity is present. In drowsiness and sleep, there is increase in theta followed by delta activity as the background slows. Abundant bursts of Frontally predominant polyspike activity followed by beta buzzes persist. There are additionally frequent right fronto-temporal (F8 max) at times F4 spike-wave discharges with a broad field.  No seizures    EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 80s.  DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Abundant diffuse spike/polyspike-and-wave discharges with some diffuse beta buzz. 2. Frequent right fronto-temporal (F8 max) spike-wave discharges with broad field 4. Mild to moderate background slowing with suboptimal organization
