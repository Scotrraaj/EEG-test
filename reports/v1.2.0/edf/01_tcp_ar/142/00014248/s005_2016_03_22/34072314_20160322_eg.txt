 HISTORY: 115 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy on phenobarbital and Dilantin referred for routine EEG for management of seizure exacerbation and assessment of mental status change.  MEDICATIONS: loaded with Dilantin; Ativan  SEDATION: as above  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  EEG BACKGROUND, EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY, EVENTS: The record opens to an ongoing seizure which consists of diffuse spike/polyspike and wave activity at 3 Hz, increasing in frequency up to 5 Hz, then slowing to 3 Hz and speeding up again to 5 Hz. This pattern continues throughout the entire duration of the study despite administration of Ativan 2 mg. Activity is diffuse but is best developed over the bilateral parasagittal chains. Clinically, the patient intermittently answers questions and follows commands bilaterally but appears slow to respond. She does not answer questions following ativan.  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to: 1. Ongoing non-convulsive generalized status epilepticus.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings indicate the presence of ongoing generalized status epilepticus.  Following this study, the treating team was informed and the patient was continued on long term monitoring.
