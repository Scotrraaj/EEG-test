SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


During wakefulness, the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude
theta <<delta activity with frequently broad waveforms of triphasic morphology.  During periods of
quiescence, these triphasic waveforms resolve.  Additionally, periods of quiescence are characterized
by increase in diffuse theta activity and occasional brief periods of discontinuity.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):




A single sharply contoured waveform is captured over the left temporal/ centroparietal region.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate diffuse slowing

2. Frequent triphasic waveforms


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.


Triphasic waves are a nonspecific EEG finding that can be seen in encephalopathy (mostly
commonly hepatic), uremia, anoxia and many other etiologies.



A single left left temporal/ centroparietal sharp transient is of unclear clinical significance.
