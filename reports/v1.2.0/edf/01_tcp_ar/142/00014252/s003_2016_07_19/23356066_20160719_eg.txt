HISTORY:

33 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O PRIOR EEG PMHX SIG FOR SZ, SPINA
BIFADA, SHUNT PLMT RT SIDE. PRESENTS WITH 2 DAYS OF VISUAL HALLUCINATION,
PROLONGED POSTICTAL STATE.




MEDICATIONS: DEPAKOTE, LAMICTAL, SEROQUEL, LORAZEPAM,    RECEIVED DILANTIN
YESTERDAY BUT NOT TODAY



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:






The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with excess of delta and theta frequencies, with a symmetric and
reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of
frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.




There is abundant bifrontal delta polymorphic slowing, sharply contoured.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and further background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Rare bifrontal (Fp1/Fp2 max > F7) spike and wave


2. Rare left frontal (Fp1 max) spike and wave


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Abundant bifrontal delta polymorphic slowing, sharply contoured

3. Rare bifrontal (Fp1/Fp2 max > F7) spike and wave


4. Rare left frontal (Fp1 max) spike and wave






CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of bifrontal and independent left frontal epileptogenic
potentials superiompsed on bifrontal dysfunction and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
