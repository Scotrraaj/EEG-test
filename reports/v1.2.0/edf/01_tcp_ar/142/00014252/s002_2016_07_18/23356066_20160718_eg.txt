HISTORY:

33 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O PRIOR EEG PMHX SIG FOR SZ, SPINA
BIFADA, SHUNT PLMT RT SIDE. PRESENTS WITH 2 DAYS OF VISUAL HALLUCINATION,
PROLONGED POSTICTAL STATE.




MEDICATIONS:

Depakote and Dilantin




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:



The limited waking background seen only with stimulation is characterized by the presence of a
mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The
normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency is present but at times poorly organized.  Excess
theta in wakefulness.




However the patient easily goes into drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and
fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Large field spikes appear to be maximal at F7 and at time FP1.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



1. Large amplitude and field left frontal spikes



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to large amplitude and field left frontal
spikes.  These indicate the presence of an epileptogenic region. In addition there is evidence of mild
diffuse background slowing and background disorganization.  Thesfindings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
