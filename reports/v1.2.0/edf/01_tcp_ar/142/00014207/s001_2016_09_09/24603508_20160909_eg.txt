a 66 y.o. female with a history of cervical stenosis and rare seizures, typically every 5
years. Recent seizure last week referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.

TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is a small
amount of theta noted in the background



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with POSTS synchronous and symmetric vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No major generalized slowing is present.

In drowsiness: focal slowing is present.  This is characterized by shifting, irregular mixed theta delta
noted in the left greater than right temporal regions.  It appears in early relaxed wakefulness



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:none



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None






ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Not only is there a driving response, lambda
was elicited



EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild background disorganization for age with prominent shifting arrhythmic delta theta noted in
drowsiness



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are nonspecific.  The focal slowing is out of the range of normal for subject of this
age.  Toxic or metabolic, ischemic cerebrovascular or other causes may contribute to the pattern
described above.  There were no previous EEGs available for comparison.
