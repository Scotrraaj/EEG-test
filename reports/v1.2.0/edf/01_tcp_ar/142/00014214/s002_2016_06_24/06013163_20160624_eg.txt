DATE OF STUDY: 06/24/16  7 PM to 06/25/2016 9 AM

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: LTM a, drowsy



HISTORY:

a 73 y.o. female with a history of ESRD presenting altered mental status referred
for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change. MEDICATIONS: vancomycin, heparin



-----------------------------------------------------------------


Clinical; Over the course of this recording, the patient was more responsive, was following some
commands, but remained non verbal



DAY 1 (06/24/16, 07:00 - 06/25/2016 9 AM)



BACKGROUND: markedly abnormal with diffuse triphasic waves, some of which have a posterior
predominance.

Tactile stimulation produced a decrease in these complexes and an increase in theta. This was
notable at 5 AM.




GENERALIZED SLOWING: marked




FOCAL SLOWING: None



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Sharply contoured activity Triphasics and
posteriorly predominent GPEDS



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Occasional (1/hour to <1min) Posterior bilateral GPED



EVENTS: Ativan was given at 7:20 PM which produced a decrease in the Triphasic waves and
resulted briefly in a delta/theta background



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60-90 BPM




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


The EEG remains remarkably abnormal with continuous triphasic waves. No electrographic seizures
were recorded. Stimulation of the patient produced an alerting. The patient's mental status was
considered better (EEG lagging behind the clinical ) and EEG recording was discontinued on the
25th.
