DATE OF STUDY: 06/24/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only

EEG #: 16-1177

CPT: 95822              ICD: 780.97



HISTORY:

a 73 y.o. female with a history of ESRD presenting altered mental status referred
for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS: vancomycin, heparin



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND, EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

The background consists of continuous 2-3 Hz generalized spike wave discharges, superimposed on
occasional low amplitude disorganized theta.  There is no clear reactivity, variability, or state change.





There is severe generalized slowing.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing with lack of reactivity


2. Continuous 2-3 Hz generalized spike wave discharges


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of highly epileptogenic generalized discharges superimposed
on severe generalized slowing.


The consulting team was notified and long term monitoring was recommended.




Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
