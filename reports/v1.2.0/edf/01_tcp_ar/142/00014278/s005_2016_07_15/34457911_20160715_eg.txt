HISTORY:


75 y.o. female with a history of PRES, found to have acute R MCA CVA referred
for EEG for treatment of status epilepticus.



MEDICATIONS:

Phenytoin, Keppra

SEDATION: intermittent use of versed



TECHNIQUE:

A continuous video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International
10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and  stimulation.





DAY 1 (07/15/16- 7/16/2016, 06:00)




BACKGROUND:

The background is markedly abnormal and asymmetric.


The left hemisphere is slow, but continuous with theta, some alpha and delta. Sharply contoured in
the frontal region.


The right hemisphere has marked disruption of faster frequency activity and high amplitude periodic
complexes, maximum T6, O2, P4

By the AM of the 16th, there is an occasional PDR of 6 Hz on the left.


Generalized slowing is present.

Right focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Periodic complexes, high amplitude, (PLEDS +) with variable maximum. The Right hemispheric
sharp waves and periodic complexes vary, from posterior T6 P4 to others which are more anterior
temporal. Brief build ups of 4-7 seconds P4 T6 periodic sharps were seen.


There were persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was not captured.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Abundant (>1/10s) R sided



EVENTS:


EKG: A single lead captured HR >130



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:


R sided PLEDS









-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 2 (7/16/2016, 06:00 - 7/17/2016, 06:00)

MEDICATIONS:


Phenytoin, Keppra

SEDATION: intermittent use of Versed

BACKGROUND: markedly slow, more so after the use of versed

Interval history- patient was intubated after MRI demonstrated large R MCA CVA.


GENERALIZED SLOWING: Slower after the use of Versed



FOCAL SLOWING: No change


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Sharply contoured activity



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Periodic complexes, high amplitude, (PLEDS +) with
variable maximum. The Right hemispheric sharp waves and periodic complexes vary, from posterior
T6 P4 to others which are more anterior temporal. Brief build ups of 4-9 seconds P4 T6 periodic
sharps were seen. Versed was initiated and the sharp waves became lower amplitude, intermittently
more continuous without evolution and occasionally stopping. There were persistent asymmetries in
amplitude and frequency.




EVENTS: No clinical  events were reported


EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 100 BPM



DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



Periodic complexes demonstrate brief build ups, responsive to midazolam drip. These results were
reviewed with the clinical team.


-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 3 (7/17/2016, 06:00 - 7/18/2016, 06:00)

Medications:Phenytoin, Keppra.


Versed was stopped on the evening of the 17th

BACKGROUND: The overall background is diffusely slow with a mixture of alpha, beta and delta
frequency activity.  The overall background is sharply contoured.




SLEEP: With characterized by an increase in background slowing and a decrease in muscle artifact.
R PLEDS are seen at 0.5 to 0.3 Periodicity.


GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change



FOCAL SLOWING: R MCA > Left hemisphere


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Sharply contoured activity



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Periodic sharp waves are noted in the right hemisphere
maximum in the right mid to posterior temporal region.  These are seen at .05 to 1.5 Hz, wax and
wane but never evolve into definitive seizures. EVENTS: Occasional agitation produces muscle
artifact



EKG: A single EKG lead captured 104 BPM, occ PVC




DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 4 (7/18/2016, 06:00 - 7/19/2016, 06:00)

Medications:Phenytoin, Keppra.


Versed was stopped on the evening of the 17th and reinitiated on the 18th because of agitation

BACKGROUND: The overall background is diffusely slow with a mixture of alpha, beta and delta
frequency activity.  The overall background is sharply contoured.


SLEEP: With characterized by an increase in background slowing and a decrease in muscle artifact.
R PLEDS are seen at 0.5 to 0.3 Periodicity.

GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change



FOCAL SLOWING: R MCA > Left hemisphere



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Sharply contoured activity


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Periodic sharp waves are noted in the right hemisphere maximum in the
right mid to posterior temporal region.  These are seen at .05 to 1.5 Hz, wax and wane but never
evolve into definitive seizures. The PLEDS seem to be waning in comparison to prior days.



EVENTS: Occasional agitation produces muscle artifact


EKG: A single EKG lead captured 104 BPM, occ PVC







DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



Generalized slowing is unchanged.

The right posterior temporal PLEDS are becoming more blunted, infrequent, though persist in sleep.







-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 5 (07/19/2016, 06:00 - 7/20/2016, 16:00)

Medications:Phenytoin, Keppra


BACKGROUND: No change, over time, less slow. GENERALIZED SLOWING: improving.



FOCAL SLOWING: No change, improving slightly.

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: marked decrease in PLEDS and periodic or subtle sharps.



EVENTS: None



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 90 BPM




DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



Slowing has improved. PLEDS  Have faded. No seizurers




-----------------------------------------------------------------



FINAL IMPRESSION:



This is abnnormal video EEG due to:



1. A highly epileptiform PLEDS+  Pattern, eventually evolving to a moderately slow and R focal slow
pattern.




FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are frequently found in association with acute cortical pathology but it is much
improved by the 20th
