HISTORY: 66 y.o. male PRESENTS WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS.  MEDICATIONS: DILANTIN, ATIVAN  SEDATION: PROPOFOL  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (2/10/2016, 10:40PM - 2/11/2016, 03:50PM)  BACKGROUND: The background is composed of an almost completely suppressed diffuse delta with intermittent 1-3 second burst of very low amplitude theta. No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  The background is not reactive but it is variable.  Sleep was not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: None  EKG: A single lead captured 84bpm  DAY 1 IMPRESSION: 1. Severe diffuse slowing   CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal 16 hr long term EEG due to severe diffuse slowing. This finding is indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology but may be due at least in part to medication effect. No seizures were seen.
