SEDATION: none



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

auditory stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is abnormal.  There is an asymmetry, with a

breach rhythm noted on the right.  The left hemisphere

demonstrated medium amplitude, somewhat slow pattern with an

alpha rhythm of 7.5 Hz, reactive.  There is excess background


theta noted throughout the left hemisphere and a small amount of

frontocentral beta.



The right hemisphere demonstrates a higher amplitude pattern.

There is rhythmic 4-5 Hz theta activity noted throughout the

right hemisphere particularly center temporal.  In addition to


the breach rhythm, there is some sharp waves with a broad field

of spread including right central temporal.  There is


superimposed arrhythmic delta activity in the right frontocentral

and central temporal regions.

During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse beta


are seen.



Sleep is not sustained


Generalized slowing is present.

Focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


in the context of breach rhythm, right central temporal sharp

waves


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

There is rhythmic theta noted but no definitive ictal pattern



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile and auditory stimulation elicit


alerting


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. nearly continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere


2. disruption of faster frequency activity on the right

3. sharply contoured slowing in the right central temporal region

4. mildly slow background on the left



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings support a bihemispheric process but more


importantly a structural or functional process in the right

hemisphere involving gray and white matter.  No seizures were

recorded.  The sharp waves are in the region of the previous

craniotomy.
