HISTORY:

58 y.o. FEMALE WITH CVA.  REMAINS UNRESPONSIVE



MEDICATIONS:

VALPROATE, OXYBUTYNIN, LIPITOR, HEPARIN



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of diffuse




theta/ delta frequencies, and an absent posterior dominant rhythm

(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient is absent.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



Nearly continuous polymorphic delta is seen over the left


hemisphere

maximally at F3. This is at times semi-rhyhtmic with no clear

evolution.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:


1. Nearly continuous focal slowing seen over the left hemisphere

maximally frontal region. At times monomorphic with no clear


evolution.

2. Moderate diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Nearly continuous focal slowing seen over the left hemisphere

maximally frontal region.  This finding is indicative of severe


focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in

origin. In addition there is moderate diffuse slowing. This

finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction,

which is etiologically nonspecific.
