HISTORY:

58 y.o. female with a history of atypical

seizure with 15 min of confusion referred for routine EEG for


characterization of seizures. CT demonstrates superior left

cerebellar infarct with stable mass effect on the fourth

ventricle with no evidence of obstructive


Hydrocephalus. Infarctions within the right cerebellum and

ventral aspect of the right pons .

Current facility-administered medications for this visit:

Depakote




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.



The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.



EEG BACKGROUND:



Continuous background with a mixture of 5-7 Hz theta with

underlying rhythmic delta.



In comparison, left side has less rhythmic theta and more

rhythmic delta.



Asymmetric vertex waves were seen in limited sleep.



Generalized slowing is present.


Focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

FIRDA

Asymmetric high amplitude vertex waves.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


Tactile stimulation produces a decrease in amplitude and increase

in theta.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:


1. Replacement of normal background with slow pattern

2. Superimposed asymmetry with more rhythmic delta activity in


the left.

3. Rare FIRDA



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings support a diffuse disturbance brain function and

superimposed focal process in the left hemisphere.
