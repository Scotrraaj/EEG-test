HISTORY:

60 y.o. female with a history of overdose referred for routine EEG for
change in mental status.



MEDICATIONS:


Inpt: Haldol, lovenox, hydralazine

Home meds: klonopin effexor lithium adderall



SEDATION: haldol


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation. This is a bedside record for an extremely
agitated patient.




EEG BACKGROUND:



The waking background is characterized by the presence of chaotic high amplitude mixed frequency
background with mixture of theta and beta. There are also bursts of arrhythmic delta and some
rhythmic frontal delta.




Sleep is not captured


Marked generalized slowing is present.


Shifting focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


FIRDA


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 88 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only bedside routine EEG due to:


1. Marked background slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are nonspecific but are suggestive of bihemispheric dysfunction, characteristic of a
toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. There are no epileptiform features noted.
