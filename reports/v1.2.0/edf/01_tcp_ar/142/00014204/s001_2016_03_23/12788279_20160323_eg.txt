HISTORY:

55 y.o. female with right lower extremity

shaking after a procedure today.



MEDICATIONS:

Versed and benadryl given







SEDATION: versed



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically




satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Diffuse excess beta activity is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS:


A brief episode of right lower extremity shaking is captured - it

has no abnormal ictal correlate.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

Beta - excess


Episode - one - right leg shaking - no abnormal ictal correlate



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal portable 23-minute awake and drowsy EEG.



A brief episode of right lower extremity shaking is captured - it

has no abnormal ictal correlate.  Only ~ 25% of simple partial

seizures are captured electrographically on a scalp EEG.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication


effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.



These findings were conveyed to the neurology consult team.
