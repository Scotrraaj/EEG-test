HISTORY:

34YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ DISORER ONSET 1 1/2 YRS AGO. PT
REPORTS 1-2 SZ PER YR. LAST SZ 1 YR AGO WITH LOC.



MEDICATIONS:


TEGRETOL, ZONISAMIDE


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a disorganized mixture of theta and delta
frequencies, with a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at best reaches 7 Hz.




Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, a more pronounced diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is captured with some normal patterns of stage 2 sleep seen. Sleep spindles are sharply
contoured and high amplitude.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Marked midline theta or ciganek rhythm is noted. However at times this is sharply contoured.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Mild to moderate diffuse slow


2. Excess beta


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 1 hour EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse background
slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect,
such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. The central sharply contoured pattern is of unclear
significance and not likely epileptiform in nature.
