START DATE OF STUDY: 12/19/16 at 12 PM

END DATE OF STUDY: 12/23/2016



RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Epilepsy Monitoring Unit

EEG TYPE: Long term recording




HISTORY:

a 71 y.o. ambidextrous female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: focal seizures with dyscognitive features.  Status post resection for
meningioma.  She has had some seizures with clear impairment of awareness but others in which she
is somewhat confused and can't move her legs.  Frequent hospitalizations for strokelike symptoms.





Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.









- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patientÂ’s exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

DAY 1 (- 12/19/2016, 11:00 to 12/20/2016)

BACKGROUND: The waking background is  continuous, asymmetric, poorly-organized, and consists
predominantly of alpha with admixed theta.


Posterior dominant rhythm was not present- 7-8 Hz on the right, 8.5 Hz on the left. +  R Breach +
shifting aysmmetries


The background is reactive,variable.

There were shifting asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  There is R temporal or hemispheric
slowing


Sleep was characterized by symmetric sleep spindles and/or K-complexes.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: despite the breach and prominent beta, with careful review Fp2 spikes
are noted in drowsiness and sleep, rarely noted at FP1/F3



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.



EVENTS: 1  clinical  events  reported or detected.


1. Pt had an episode around 8:01pm.While RN was in the room talking to the patient , RN noted
slurring and slowing of speech. Although she has trouble moving UE  both feet were moving side to
side.Pt repeated same sentence few times.Was OX self. Following commands, unable to move her
legs, felt heaviness in her legs,but arms had limited movement..Pt unable to recall code word.
Patient was aware of the episode initially. When she was back to baseline was able to move all her
extremities normally.  Careful review of video shows her automatically moving the proximal legs.




No EEG changes were noted, wake EEG with reactive PDR.

DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

1. Slowing and disorganization


2. Focal slowing

3. Behavioral or clinicial event without EEG change

4. Focal spikes can be defined with re-formatting of data, in region of prior resection.

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


SEIZURES/EVENTS:


There are  2 clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

#1: 4:22 PM 3:29 duration. Patient feels "funky" legs feel like they are not hers. Feet feel fine but
proximal legs are odd.  She engages with the nurse, but moves her legs very little.  She can follow
commands. This is a typical home seizure for her. She could recall a code word. Afterwards she gets
under the covers.







#2 5:45 PM 1:30 duration. Patient is lying transverse on the bed, with legs hanging off.  The nurse
and pushes button, patient feels odd with same proximal leg issues.  She answers questions
appropriately and follows complex commands with her arms. She moves the legs very little.


EKG: A single lead captured


Day 2 Impression/ Clinical Correlation

Although this is an abnormal background with right focal slowing and some sharply contoured
slowing, all of the events thus far have not had an EEG signature.  This finding has been discussed
with patient and family

______________________________________________

DAY 5( - 12/23/2016, 12/24/2016) at 11 am



AEDs: OXC-  On her usual dose, TPM was held



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: Unchanged, mild background slowing with superimposed focal
slowing. PDR = 7 Hz

Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not sustained.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


In the context of breach rhythm, Fp2 spike or sharp wave is identified in the bursts of R focal slowing.
There is also sharply contoured slowing at F8. This is less prominent in the last day of recording.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

SEIZURES/EVENTS:none



EKG: A single lead captured 84 BPM



INDUCTION PROCEDURES: Did not produce seizures

Sleep deprivation


Photic stimulation


SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:


Interictal Findings:  The baseline EEG is abnormal.  At times, there is generalized slowing and
intermittent superimposed focal slowing in the region of the previous craniotomy.  Epileptiform
activity can BE identified in the frontal regions, primarily on the right, rarely noted on the left





Clinical Findings:

The patient had  3  clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the
epilepsy monitoring unit.  These were confirmed with her family to represent her typical spells with
difficulty moving both of her legs.  The patient was awake during the EEG within EEG that was easily
interpreted and did not differ substantially from her background.  No ictal pattern was associated with
the events



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1.NES



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1.  While this adult has clear epilepsy risk factors and in abnormal baseline EEG, the current
symptoms that she is experiencing appear to be nonepileptic seizures.


She has risk for focal epilepsy and therefore seizure medication will be continued, but medication
schedule was simplified.  The diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures, and the potential for epileptic
seizures was discussed with the family and a safety plan is being developed
