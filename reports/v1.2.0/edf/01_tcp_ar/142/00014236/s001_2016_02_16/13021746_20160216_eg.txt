HISTORY:

53 y.o. female with a history of CVA, COPD, HTN,

breast cancer, and bipolar disorder referred for routine EEG for


after being found down with acute confusion by her daughter.


MEDICATIONS: Lithium, gabapentin




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a


fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies,

with occasional excess of theta, with a symmetric and reactive 9


Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is

present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Occasional left temporal sharp waves are seen both in

isolation and in runs during drowsiness. These have a morphology


most consistent with wicket waves, a benign variant.




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild


diffuse cerebral dysfunction. The left temporal sharp waves

described above are most consistent with a benign variant, wicket

waves.
