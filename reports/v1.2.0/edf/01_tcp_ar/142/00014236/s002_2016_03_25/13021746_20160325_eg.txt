HISTORY:

53 y.o. WOMAN WITH CC CHANGE IN MS.   BASELINE PT

FUNCTIONAL AND LIVES ON HER OWN.  SIMILAR EVENT 1 MONTH AGO PT


HAD EEG AT THAT TIME


MEDICATIONS:


LEVOTHYROXINE, INSULIN, HEPARIN, CEFTRIAXONE, ASA,

ZOCORLEVOTHYROXINE, INSULIN, HEPARIN, CEFTRIAXONE, ASA, ZOCOR



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


limited record due to frequent movement artifact and included a




single channel of EKG.

EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity

was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity


with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies.




Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology

are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms


demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.


Sleep is not captured

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Occasional left temporal sharply countoured waves are seen

both in


isolation and in runs during drowsiness. These have a

morphology

most consistent with wicket waves, a benign variant.






ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.





EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 86 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal limited awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:


1. Triphasics waves

2.  Mild to moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal


organization




CLINICAL CORTRELATION:

The frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe diffuse


background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe

diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but

suggestive of a metabolic origin.
