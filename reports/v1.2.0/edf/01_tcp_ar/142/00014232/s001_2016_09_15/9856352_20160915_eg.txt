DATE OF STUDY: 09/15/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 52 y.o. female with a history of repetitive seizures after cooking ingestion referred
for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 20 mg

busPIRone (BUSPAR) tablet 10 mg

ziprasidone (GEODON) capsule 60 mg


nicotine (NICODERM CQ) patch 14 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg




TECHNIQUE:



A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is brief characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex
waves,and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.




A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
