HISTORY:

61 y.o. MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ .

PMH: HTN, FHF, COPD, HLD, OSA, ? DEMENTIA AND SZ. PRIOR EEG




MEDICATIONS:


Keppra


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:



Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage

delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to


posterior gradient of frequencies. At time a PDR of at best 6Hz

was noted in wakefulness.


With drowsiness the background had decreased muscle artifact and


more pronounced diffuse delta more than theta.



Sleep is not captured


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

Frequent PVCs were seen.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and draowsy routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate diffuse background slowing





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of


moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
