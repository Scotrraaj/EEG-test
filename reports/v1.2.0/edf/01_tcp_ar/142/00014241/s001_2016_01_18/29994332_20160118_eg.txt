HISTORY:

a 61 y.o. Male PRESENTS TO THE ED AFTER HAVING

2 SZ AT HOME.



PMH: HTN, FHF, COPD, HLD, OSA, ? DEMENTIA



MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The posterior dominant rhythm was at best 6Hz. Background

activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta


activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior

gradient of frequencies.


Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 126 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Diffuse slow, moderate



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background

slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically

nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
