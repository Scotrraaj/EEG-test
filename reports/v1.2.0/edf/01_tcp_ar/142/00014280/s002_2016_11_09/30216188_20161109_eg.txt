HISTORY: 52 y.o. male with a history of h/o factor V leiden, pulmonary embolism, s/p B/L lung transplantation and tracheostomy, s/p intercostal muscle flap repair of left bronchial dehiscence who had chest tube placement this AM under IR and was found less responsive, workup showed R pontine infarct. He has a history L corona radiata, R parieto-occipital, bilateral cerebellar infarcts.  Long term EEG monitoring requested to evaluate periodic episodes of desaturation and staring with decreased responsiveness.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (Solu-MEDROL) 60 mg in sterile water IV Syringe albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 2.5 mg albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 30 mg [START ON 11/10/2016] tacrolimus (PROGRAF) capsule 1 mg tacrolimus (PROGRAF) capsule 0.5 mg white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application cisatracurium (NIMBEX) 200 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 200 mL infusion propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion sodium polystyrene (KAYEXALATE) suspension 15 g albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 5 mg ipratropium (ATROVENT) 0.02 % nebulizer solution 0.5 mg heparin 25,000 units (100 units/mL) in 0.45% sodium chloride 250 mL infusion (Premix) sodium chloride (HYPER-SAL) 7 % nebulizer solution 4 mL ceFEPIme (MAXIPIME) 2 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB midazolam (VERSED) 1 mg/mL injection 2 mg mycophenolate (CELLCEPT) suspension 250 mg LORazepam (ATIVAN) tablet 1 mg voriconazole (VFEND) suspension 200 mg oxyCODONE (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 10 mg oxyCODONE (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 5 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) tablet 50 mg insulin NPH (HumuLIN N,NovoLIN N) injection 15 Units dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 2-10 Units polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) packet 17 g sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg valGANciclovir (VALCYTE) solution 900 mg magnesium oxide (MAG-OX) tablet 400 mg pravastatin (PRAVACHOL) tablet 10 mg venlafaxine (EFFEXOR) tablet 25 mg levothyroxine (SYNTHROID, LEVOTHROID) injection 95 mcg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL senna leaf extract (SENOKOT) syrup 176 mg acetaminophen (TYLENOL) oral solution 650 mg   SEDATION: no continuo us sedation  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/9/2016, 13:44 - 11/10/2016, 11:11)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of predominantly theta with admixed alpha and delta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7-8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.   As the day progresses, patient started on propofol ~ 11/9 17:00. This correlates with further background slowing and attenuation of theta, with increased prevalence of delta and superimposed beta.  Mild-moderate generalized slowing is present at first.  Severe generalized slowing occurs as day progresses and patient started on propofol. No focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: 1. Occasional runs of 1 Hz generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA) at 1 Hz for < 10 sec   OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EVENTS:  11/9/2016 at 13:44 (duration: 2 min 23 sec) Clinical: At study start, tech pushes button as she notes patient is less responsive - he does not attend and mouth movements as is his baseline. Gaze is midline. He intermittent twitching movements of his head towards the right - this appears related to respiratory effort.  At the onset, he licks his lips. He does not follow simple commands and continues staring straight ahead. EEG: no change in awake background  11/9/2016 at 14:05 (duration: unclear - patient not assessed until he is at baseline) Clinical: Nurse has just finished cleaning patient and asks him to follow her finger. He does not. She asks him to raise his arms up - he does not. Nurse pushes event button. EEG: no change in awake background   EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 80s  FINAL IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: 1. Mild-moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization, with onset of severe generalized slowing as propofol uptitrated 2. Occasional runs of 1 Hz generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA) at 1 Hz for < 10 sec  3. Two episodes of decreased responsiveness without associated EEG change  FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION: The episodes of decreased responsiveness described above are not due to seizure activity.  EEG background findings are indicative of a diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which was mild-moderate at study start, and worsened in the setting of uptitration of propofol (medication effect). Generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA, also known as FIRDA) is a nonspecific but pathologic finding that is most commonly seen in toxic-metabolic states, but may also be seen with deep structural lesions or increased intracranial pressure.  In this case, it may correlate with sedating medications.
