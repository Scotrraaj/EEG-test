HISTORY:

52 y.o. male with a history of h/o factor V leiden, pulmonary embolism, s/p B/L lung
transplantation and tracheostomy, s/p intercostal muscle flap repair of left bronchial dehiscence who
had chest tube placement this AM under IR, with findings of L corona radiata, R parieto-occipital,
bilateral, and pontine infarcts. Patient on arrival to the RICU after the procedure was noted to be
unresponsive and staring - referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.

TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
predominantly theta with admixed alpha and delta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7-8
Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is present but suboptimal.







Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild-moderate generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of mild-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.
