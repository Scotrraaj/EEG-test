HISTORY:

22 y.o. FEMALE WITH DRUG OD,  PT WITH CC OF MYOCLONUS VS. SZS.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:

albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 5 mg

SEDATION: see above



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse high
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
Diffuse 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate to severe generalized slow waves





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal comatose EEG due to moderate to severe diffuse background slowing and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe
diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect,
such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
