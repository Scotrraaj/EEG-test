DATE OF STUDY: 06/30/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: >1 hour, awake and asleep

EEG #: 16-1213

CPT: 95813



HISTORY:

a 28 y.o. female with a history of several year history of R sided numbness, recent
TC seizure referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

ergocalciferol, Vitamin D2, (VITAMIN D) 50,000 unit Capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth once a week.

cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours as needed for
Muscle spasms.


pregabalin (LYRICA) 75 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth 2 times daily for 360 days. NOT
TAKING

predniSONE (DELTASONE) 10 mg tablet, 4 PO QD for 3 days, 2 PO QD for 3 days, 1 po QD for 3
days

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is markedly abnormal and is characterized by the presence of posteriorly
predominant slowing noted intermittently, as well as an amplitude asymmetry on the right. The PDR
is 10 Hz but reaches 60-70 uV. There is excess theta


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep includes spindles




Right occiptal  focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Photic stimulation elicits both a sustained and prominent high amplitude driving, but also at some
frequencies (15) 3-4 Hz posteriorly predominant spike and wave activity.


Similar bursts are seen in drowsiness.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Sharply contoured activity, posteriorly


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation:  High amplitude posterior slowing


Photic Stimulation: see above



EVENTS:

There are electrographic events captured during this study. No clinical impairment could be
discerned, though patient not tested during each discharge.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.? irreg at times


IMPRESSION:




This is an abnormal  routine EEG due to:

1. Spike and wave activity in drowsiness and photic stimulation



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are  unusual and support a generalized mechanism for epilepsy. The findings were
reviewed with the patient by a colleague and she was started on Keppra. Please consider input from
the Epilepsy Team.



Attending Epileptologist: 


I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
