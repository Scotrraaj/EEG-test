HISTORY:

29 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy in the

setting of L frontal oligodendroglioma s/p resection, referred


for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

clonazePAM (KLONOPIN) 0.5 mg tablet, 1 tab qam and 3 tab Qhs

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 100 mg tablet, TAKE 1 AND 1/2 TABLET BY


MOUTH EVERY MORNING AND TAKE 2 TABLETS BY MOUTH EVERY EVENING

PROAIR HFA 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale  into the lungs.

ranitidine (ZANTAC) 150 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


tretinoin (RETIN-A) 0.05 % cream,

cetirizine (ZYRTEC) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.

montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth


nightly.




gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 400 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth 4

times daily.


escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by

mouth daily.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

There is subtle continuous left fronto-temporal polymorphic


slowing.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Subtle continues left fronto-temporal polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of left fronto-temporal


cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.

When compared to the prior study in 9/2014, the current study is

similar, though the slowing is more subtle.
