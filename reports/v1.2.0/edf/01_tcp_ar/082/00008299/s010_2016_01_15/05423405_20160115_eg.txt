HISTORY:

This is a 67 y.o. right handed female admitted for continuous


video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring with a history of:

paroxysmal events of unclear etiology. Patient reports episodes

of sudden fall with loss of consciousness, unwitnessed. No known


tonic or clonic activity. She denies urinary incontinence.



Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Differential diagnosis


evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more


of the following reasons:




- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or

clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and


morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and

determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left


untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual

mortality rate.

- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient

number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are


reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures

and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures

and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient

safety during seizures;

- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these


medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses

to document patient's exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG

monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:


A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of

monitoring.  The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG


monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were

placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20

international electrode system.  Additionally, T1 and T2

electrodes were placed in this patient.  Sphenoidal electrodes


were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and

verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded


referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to

computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently

reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.




Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and

computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG


activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8

hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A


neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.

The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a


registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and

testing.  During times when a technician was not available, EEG


recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and

nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.



The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program


(trademark named

time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.


Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were

reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and

detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external

hard drive media.

SEDATION: None




DAY 1 (01/11/2016, 10AM - 1/12/2016, 08:00)




BACKGROUND:



The waking background is continuous, symmetric, moderately

well-organized, and consists predominantly of alpha and beta


activity.




Posterior dominant rhythm was 8-9Hz present and reactive.



The background is reactive and variable.




There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.

However, at times during wakefulness, there was mild excessive


theta activity noted.




Sleep was characterized by symmetric sleep spindles and/or

K-complexes.




PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Occasional wicket waves


are noted during drowsiness and sleep over the left temporal

region.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present

Overall Summary and impression: This was a non-diagnostic 5 day

video-EEG recording session. No clinical events were captured

despite medication cessation and two nights of sleep deprivation.


Mild inter-ictal abnormalities were noted including wicket

sharps over the left temporal regions during drowsiness and


sleep, and mild diffuse slowing during wakefulness. The

differential diagnosis of seizures versus non-epileptic seizures

versus syncope was discussed with the patient and her daughter.

The patient wished to be discharged off of seizure medications.


Risk:benefit of medication cessation was discussed in terms of

seizures, falls, injury, and death. Possible need for additional


EMU evaluation was discussed.  She will remain on low-dose

topiramate for migraine relief. She will follow up with Dr. Luo

as an outpatient.
