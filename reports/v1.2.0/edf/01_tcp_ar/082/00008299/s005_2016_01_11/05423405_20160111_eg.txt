History:	67 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF FREQUENT FALLS/ ASSOC WITH SYNCOPE..  
	PMHX: DEMENTIA, CHRONIC BACK PAIN, GERD AND ?? SZ. (PRIOR EEG 2011), 
	HTN,  SYNCOPE SEEN IN NEURO
Medications:	Depakote.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Background activity is predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz 
activity, with absence of the normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  During drowsiness,
 the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and 
the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.  
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was 
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing 
and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse 
cerebral dysfunction.
