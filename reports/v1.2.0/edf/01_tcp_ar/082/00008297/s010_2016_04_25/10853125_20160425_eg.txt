DATE OF STUDY: 04/25/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 26 y.o. YEAR OLD FEMALE L HANDED. PT HAS HAD SZ SINCE BIRTH.
MOTHER STAES LAS SZ 1 YR AGO. PMHX, DEVELOPMENT  DELAY



MEDICATIONS:

lacosamide (VIMPAT) 10 mg/mL Solution, Take 150 mg by mouth 2 times daily.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves
(some asymmetric vertex  and sleep spindles are also seen), sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow
wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to the asymmetric vertex and spindles.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

The asymmetric spindles and vertex may imply a disconnection between hemispheres. No focal or
epileptiform abnormalities are seen.
