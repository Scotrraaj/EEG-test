HISTORY:

64 y.o. MAN WITH H/O SEIZURES.  CC OF SEIZURES.  PMHX: SZ, CVA, HIV,
HTN


MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


phenytoin (DILANTIN) tablet 100 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 10 mg


PARoxetine (PAXIL) tablet 20 mg

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB



SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


A posterior dominant rhythm that at best reached 7Hz was present. Background activity was
characterized by diffuse theta with some delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to
posterior gradient of frequencies.



Some state changes were seen with vertex and spindles intermittently.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate diffuse slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.



No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
