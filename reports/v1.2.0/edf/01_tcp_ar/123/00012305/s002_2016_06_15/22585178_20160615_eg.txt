HISTORY:

83 y.o. female with a history of syncope vs seizure.



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:






The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the left anterior temporal region.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Occasional mild-to-moderate left anterior temporal focal slowing.

2. No stage II sleep

3. No epileptiform discharges




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


Occasional mild-to-moderate left anterior temporal focal slowing.  This finding is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.
