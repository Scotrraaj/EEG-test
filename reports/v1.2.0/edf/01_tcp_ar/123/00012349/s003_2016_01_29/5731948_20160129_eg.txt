MEDICATIONS:

by mouth daily.

VIT C/VIT E/LUTEIN/MIN/OMEGA-3 (OCUVITE PO), Take  by mouth.

rectally daily.


sodium phosphates (FLEET ENEMA) 19-7 gram/118 mL Enema, Place

rectally.


magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) 400 mg/5 mL Suspension,

Take  by mouth.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right


hemisphere maximal at C4 region. There is an also increased

amplitude in this region consistent with a breach.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation was not performed



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Continuous focal slowing and breach in the right hemisphere

maximal in the central region

2. Breach rhythm



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous


focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximal in the central

region and associated breach.  This finding is indicative of a

focal structural lesion in this region. No seizures were seen
