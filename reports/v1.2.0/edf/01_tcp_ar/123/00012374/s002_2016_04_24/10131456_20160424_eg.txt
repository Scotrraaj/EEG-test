HISTORY:

65 y.o. male with a history of CVA, DM2 referred for routine EEG for screening for
subclinical seizures. Patient presented with acute change in mental status earlier this morning and
on exam was quite lethargic, with a stiff neck, and a temperature of 102. The technician notes that
the patient was vocalizing during the hook-up.




MEDICATIONS: metoprolol



SEDATION: None listed


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG. Note that the patient was not stimulated during the recording.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The majority of the study consists of drowsiness and sleep, which consist of 6-7.5 Hz theta alternating
with diffuse delta. Sleep transients are not captured.



During very brief arousals, the background reacts with faster frequencies, but a well-formed posterior
dominant rhythm is not sustained.



Mild generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing and absence of well formed sleep transients


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific indicators mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may at least in part
be associated with a suboptimally awake state. If clinically warranted a repeat study with
stimulation/alerting maneuvers can be performed for further assessment.
