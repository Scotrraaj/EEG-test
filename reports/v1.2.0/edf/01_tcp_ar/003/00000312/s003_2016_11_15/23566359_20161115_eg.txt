HISTORY:

39 y.o. male with a history of medically refractory epilepsy (onset of seizures
age 9, seizure free for years) referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 100 mg tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth every evening

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 150 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. Brand nec,
documented break thru seizures with generic


ergocalciferol, Vitamin D2, 50,000 unit Capsule, take 1 capsule by mouth every week


CALCIUM CARBONATE/VITAMIN D3 (CALCIUM+D ORAL), Take 2 tablets by mouth daily.


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:






A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7-7.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with fair cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces scant
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.






IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
