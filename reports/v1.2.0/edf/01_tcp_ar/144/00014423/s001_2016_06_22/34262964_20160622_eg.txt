HISTORY:

57 y.o. male with a history of  Epilepsy and Down Syndrome, s/p several seizures
today, brief. 20 second duration,  referred for routine EEG for treatment of seizure and screening for
subclinical seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


levetiracetam (KEPPRA XR) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY 12 HOURS

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, TAKE ONE CAPSULE BY MOUTH EVERY DAY



SEDATION:  Ativan


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.  Snore artifact was seen.


EEG BACKGROUND:



The background is characterized almost exclusively by sleep. During drowsiness, slow rolling eye
movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.


Stage II Sleep dominates most of the record with  normal sleep transients, with synchronous and
symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
Limited wakefulness includes low amplitude but  symmetric mixture of theta and delta frequencies,
with a scant reactive theta pattern . The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is absent





Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Stimulation produces an arousal.



EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 104 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with post ictal state or other diffuse disorder of
cerebral function.
