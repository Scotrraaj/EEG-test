HISTORY:

This is a 64 y.o. female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring
with a history of: TSC 1 s/p R frontal tuberectomy, with new events of unclear etiology involving
staring.



Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events (staring).



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded
referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive.  Periods of interest
were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 12-24 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION: None



DAY 1 (6/20/2016, 13:09 - 6/21/2016, 06:00)


BACKGROUND:



The waking background is continuous, reactive, well-organized, and consists predominantly of alpha
with admixed beta, organized in a normal anterior-posterior gradient with a posterior dominant
rhythm of 9 Hz present in wakefulness that attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.


There is continuous right hemispheric polymorphic delta activity.

Background rhythms are >50% higher in amplitude over the right hemisphere, consistent with breach
rhythm.




Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and
further background slowing.

Sleep is characterized by synchronous spindles, vertex waves, and K complexes which are at times
seen better over the left hemisphere.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Occasionally sharp waves are noted over the right temporal region (T4 max >T2/T6), activated by
drowsiness


2. Rare left temporal spikes (T1/T3 max), activated by drowsiness



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

1. Continuous right hemispheric polymorphic delta activity


2. Right hemispheric breach rhythm

3. Occasional right temporal sharp waves (T4 max >T2/T6), activated by drowsiness


4. Rare left temporal spikes (T1/T3 max), activated by drowsiness


These findings are consistent with right hemispheric dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.

Right hemispheric breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known history of craniotomy.


There are potential epileptogenic focuses over the right and left temporal regions, independently.

INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: as on day 1, with the additional finding of:

1. Rarely the right hemispheric slowing is rhythmic and sharply contoured at 1.5-2 Hz for <10 seconds



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Occasionally sharp waves are noted over the right temporal region (T4 max >T2/T6), activated by
drowsiness

2. Rare left temporal spikes (T1/T3 max), activated by drowsiness



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None

Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds on 6/21 at 11:19 with good
cooperation and produces no effect.

at 11:25 does not produce any EEG changes.

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 60s.




DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patients interictal findings were significant for a posterior dominant
rhythm of 9 Hz, with continuous right hemispheric polymorphic delta activity that was rarely rhythmic
and sharply contoured, correlating with right hemispheric cerebral dysfunction.  Additionally, a right
hemispheric breach rhythm was present, consistent with this patient's known history of prior
craniotomy.  There were occasionally sharp waves noted over the right temporal region (T4 max
>T2/T6), activated by drowsiness and rarely left temporal spikes (T1/T3 max), activated by
drowsiness, consistent with independent epileptogenic potential over these regions.





ICTAL FINDINGS:


The patient did not have any clinical events.


SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:


1. No seizures/events captured during this 5-day study


EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:


1. Complex partial (suspected)


CONCLUSION:


was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video EEG.
This was an elective EMU monitoring session for evaluation of staring episodes.  The patient's
antiepileptics were unchanged during the admission.  No targeted episodes were captured.



We recommend that she follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an
outpatient.


We also recommend follow-up with her internist/cardiologist for the sinus tachycardia that was
captured occasionally upon getting out of bed.
