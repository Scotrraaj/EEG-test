HISTORY: 38 y.o. MAN PRESENTS FOR PULMONARY THROMBOENDARTERECTOMY, TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM, ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM.  INDUCTION MEDS: VERSED, FENTANYL, ETOMADATE, ROCURONIUM  AND ISOFLURANE/ PERFUSION  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  INCISION 8:30AM , START COOLING AT 9:38AM, BURST SUPPRESSION APPROX 10:02AM, SUPPRESSION ACHIEVED 10:31AM RE-WARMING  11:40 AM  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well-organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.    As the study continues with induction the background become composed of more theta then delta. It then progressively starts becoming more attenuated and later burst suppression is seen followed by complete suppression.  After rewarming the background slowly increases in amplitude and more faster frequencies are seen.  Sleep is not captured  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Frequent left F7/F3 sharp waves are seen at time with a Fp1 component. This are more prominent in sleep, during induction they becoming periodic for seconds with no evolution. Rare F8 sharp waves are seen.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of  bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: 1. Uneventful EEG during PTE. 2. Bilateral frontal (left much more than right) sharp waves of unclear significance.   CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an uneventful 8 hrs EEG during intraoperative monitoring. All changes were reported to primary team. The frequent sharp waves are concerning for a potential epileptogenic focus in this region. In the absence of a reported history of seizures/epilepsy the significance of this findings is unclear. An evaluation by an epileptologist may be beneficial if clinically needed.
