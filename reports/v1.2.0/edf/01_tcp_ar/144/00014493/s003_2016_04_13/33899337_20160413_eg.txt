HISTORY:

38 y.o. male with a history of a recent

pulmonary surgery.



MEDICATIONS:

Propofol


precedex


SEDATION: Propofol


precedex


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.



During periods of agitation, the background consists of diffuse

slow polymorphic delta activity with underriding fast activity.

During periods of quiescence, polymorphic theta appears and brief

periods of background discontinuity are captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


Diffuse slowing - severe

No electrographic seizures



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal portable 21-minute EEG due to severe diffuse

slowing.


This finding is indicative of severe diffuse cerebral

dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
