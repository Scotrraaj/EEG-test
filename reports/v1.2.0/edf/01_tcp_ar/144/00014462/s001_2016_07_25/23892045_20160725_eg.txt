HISTORY:

70 y.o. MAN WITH RIGHT ISCHEMIC THROMBUS.  NOW WITH CHANGE IN
MENTAL STATES WITH NEED TO BE INTUBATED



MEDICATIONS:


DILAUDID,  (7/24 MIDAZOLAM 2MG, LORAZEPAM 2MG), METOPROLOL, ASA, PROTONIX,
ATORVASTATIN, HEPARIN



SEDATION: See above.



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:





No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage almost completely attenuated delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to
posterior gradient of frequencies.




Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Some muscle reactivity is noted with ocular stimulation.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Severe diffuse background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal routine EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
