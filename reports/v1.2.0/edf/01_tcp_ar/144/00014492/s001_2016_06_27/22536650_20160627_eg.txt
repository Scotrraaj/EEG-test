DATE OF STUDY: 06/27/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep


HISTORY:

a 40 y.o. Man p/w CC of acute L side weakness for a couple months. PMH:
Panic attacks. CTH negative



MEDICATIONS:


ASA


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The limited waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a
moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Patient rapidly goes to Sleep and it is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and
symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. Please note patient had a very short sleep latency.
This may be indicative of a sleep disturbance.













Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
