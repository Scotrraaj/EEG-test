DATE OF STUDY: 01/19/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 60 min - 3 hr, awake and asleep



HISTORY:

a 24 y.o. male with a history of  Single tonic clonic seizure referred for routine EEG
for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


zonisamide (ZONEGRAN) 100 mg capsule, Take 3 capsules by mouth daily for 360 days.

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily for 60 days.

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.






During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles POSTS  and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
an increase in amplitude.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE: A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION: This is a normal 1 hour awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or
electrographic events reported or detected.
