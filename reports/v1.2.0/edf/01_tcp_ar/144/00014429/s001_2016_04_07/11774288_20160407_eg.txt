HISTORY:

64 y.o. male with a history of syncope.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

celecoxib (CELEBREX) 50 mg capsule, Take 50 mg by mouth daily.


sertraline (ZOLOFT) 25 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth nightly.

valsartan (DIOVAN) 160 mg tablet, Take 160 mg by mouth daily.

ETODOLAC PO, Take  by mouth as needed.


gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 600 mg tablet, Take 300 mg by mouth 3

times daily. As needed

OXYCODONE HCL/ACETAMINOPHEN (PERCOCET PO), Take  by mouth. As


needed


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.







SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of

very low amplitude diffuse beta activity.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric


background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54-60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 31-minute routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
