DATE OF STUDY: 01/17/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 39 y.o. male with a history of anxiety, depression, and gun shot would who presented
with 15 min of left arm and face numbness, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal
events.




MEDICATIONS:

No current facility-administered medications for this encounter.


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

[START ON 1/18/2017] aspirin 81 mg chewable tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

sertraline (ZOLOFT) 50 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 12 hours for 360 days.


oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 4
hours as needed for Pain.

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) 40 mg tablet,



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.


If clinically warranted, a recording with stage II sleep may be helpful.
