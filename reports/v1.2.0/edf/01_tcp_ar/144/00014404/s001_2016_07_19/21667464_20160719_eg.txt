HISTORY:

55 y.o. female with a history of hypoxic respiratory failure and difficulty weaning
from sedation, and workup for lung transplant referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental
status change.



Patient is on ECMO.


MEDICATIONS: FENTANYL, VERSED, PRECEDEX



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:





The background is symmetric and continuous but poorly organized and consists of mostly delta with
occasional admixed alpha and beta frequencies. There is no reactivity to noxious stimulation,
variability, or state change.




Severe generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal coma study portable EEG due to:


1. Severe generalized slowing, with poor organization and lack of reactivity/variability/state change


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which
may in part be related to sedating medications.
