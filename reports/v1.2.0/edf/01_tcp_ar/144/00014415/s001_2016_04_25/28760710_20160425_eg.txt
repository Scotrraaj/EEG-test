DATE OF STUDY: 04/25/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only





HISTORY:

a 56 y.o. MALE P/W APHASIA AND RIGHT SIDED WEAKNESS / STROKE ALERT.
PMHX: SEVERE COPS, HLD, HYPOTHYROIDISM, ALCOHOL ABUSE



CTH: NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL ABNORMALITIES



CTA HEAD/NECK: LEFT CAROTID OCCLUSION 100% BLOCKAGE


MEDICATIONS:


HEPARIN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to movement and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 77 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Generalized slow waves, moderate to severe.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake only routine limited EEG due to diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
