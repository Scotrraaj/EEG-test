HISTORY:

71 y.o. female with a history of AKI and

syncope referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status


change.


MEDICATIONS:


No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.

SEDATION: morphine



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram


(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with

T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a

technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of


EKG and verbal stimulation.  Muscle artifact was prominent.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha, theta  and beta


frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 5 Hertz posterior

dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient

of frequency and amplitude is present.  FIRDA was present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.

Delta increases in drowsiness.


Moderate generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: verbal stimuli elicits alerting and slow

alpha/ PDR.


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate generalized slowing

2. FIRDA


3. Slow alpha.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findingsare frequently found in association with toxic or


metabolic encephalopathy.
