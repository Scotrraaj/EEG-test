HISTORY:

34 y.o. female with a history of seizures

referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


ferrous gluconate 324 mg (37.5 mg iron) Tablet, Take 1 tablet by

mouth 2 times daily (with meals).

docusate sodium (COLACE) 100 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth


2 times daily.

Prenatal Multivit-Ca-Min-Fe-FA (PRENATAL VITAMIN) Tablet, Take

one tablet daily


labetalol (NORMODYNE) 200 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2

times daily.

multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth


daily.





No current facility-administered medications for this visit.





SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A regular heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy 22-minute routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
