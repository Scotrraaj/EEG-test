HISTORY:

27 y.o. male with a history of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.

testosterone (ANDROGEL) 1 %(50 mg/5 gram) gel, Place 5 g onto the skin daily.


ETHOSUXIMIDE PO, Take 1,000 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None






TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Patient remains awake throughout the recording.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

A 2.9 second burst of generalized frontally predominant spike and wave discharges with a repetition
rate of ~3.5-4 Hz is captured during hyperventilation.  Patient is not tested during the burst and no
clinical change is reported by the EEG technologist.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

none



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.





HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. A 2.9 sec burst of 3.5-4 Hz generalized spike and wave





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This finding is suggestive of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.
