SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to frequent movement artifact and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well poorly symmetric mixture of mainly
theta frequencies and some intermittent faster frequencies are seen, with a posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR)  That at best reached 8 Hertz . There normal anterior-to-posterior gradient is present at
times and not well established.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


Mild generalized slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Mild diffuse slow waves and disorganization


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to mild diffuse slow waves and
disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
