HISTORY:

This is a 39 y.o. right handed man presenting with episodes of strange smell, abdominal pain,
diarrhea followed by loss of consciousness, shaking since age 7.




Seizure semiology:

Type 1: Starts with strange smells of burning, garbage, sometimes floating lights, metallic taste in
mouth, abdominal pain and loss of bowels followed by loss of consciousness and left sided shaking,
then generalized shaking. Occurs 1-2 times per month.





Type 2: Feels aura symptoms with sweating followed by diarrhea.




Type 3: Staring episodes for few seconds, sometimes followed by confusion.




Current AEDs:


Keppra 500mg - 1000mg

Divalproex EC 1500mg BID


Ativan 2mg for frequent auras.



Prior AEDs: None.




Epilepsy risk factors:

Prolonged birth time, full term, no NICU admission, multiple hospital admissions with asthma,
pneumonia and needed oxygen, no developmental delay, no intracranial infection, no family history
of seizures, multiple mild head injuries, no alcohol or other drug use.





PMHx: Epilepsy, leukemia on gleevac theapy, HTN, DM



PSHx: Vasectomy, Appendectomy.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Characterization of seizures.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patient's exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.







Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 24 hr tablet 1,500 mg



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate

attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.

sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.

Conclusion:

1. Probable psychogenic non-epileptic seizures



This EMU admission captured type 2 events but not type 1. had a conversation with
patient and mother about the likelihood that all the semiologies are likely not epileptic despite not
being captured. Unfortunately, since the type 1 episode was not captured epilepsy cannot be
definitively ruled out. He was recommended to have psychological and psychiatric follow up. He will
also follow up. Keppra was not restarted but Depakote will remain.
