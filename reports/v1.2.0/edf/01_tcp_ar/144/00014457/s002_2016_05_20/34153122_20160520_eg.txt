DATE OF STUDY: 05/20/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, critical care EEG




HISTORY:

 a 71 y.o. female with a history of acute seizures after thoracic artery aneursym
repair. Possible L MCA CVA,  referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Vecuronium given during EEG




SEDATION: ativan



TECHNIQUE:

BEDSIDE Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically unsatisfactory record and included a single channel of EKGand verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The initial background is initially obscured by muscle. With a paralytic agent, there is 6 minutes of
good quality EEG demonstrating a lower voltage suppressed pattern on Right, with a more
continuous pattern on the left with bursts of theta.


Generalized slowing is present.


Focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile stimulation produces a more continuous pattern on left



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 156 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal ICU routine EEG due to:


1. Suppressed pattern on right

2. Slow pattern on left, but reactive.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with a structural or functional process on the right,
as well as a bihemispheric process.  Ongoing observation and a repeat 20 min good quality EEG are
advised to understand the discrepancy between the CT and EEG findings.
