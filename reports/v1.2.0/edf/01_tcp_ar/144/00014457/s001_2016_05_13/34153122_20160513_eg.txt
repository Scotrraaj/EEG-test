DATE OF STUDY: 05/13/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only





HISTORY:

 a 72 y.o. female who presents with change in mental status and a possible seizure.



MEDICATIONS:

Xanax, percocet




SEDATION: xanax



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background consists of diffuse excess beta activity.





Occasional polymorphic theta activity is seen over the left temporal region.



Patient remains awake throughout the recording.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~100 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Occasional mild left temporal focal slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly
structural in origin.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.



No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
