SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening and a largeamount of generalized beta activity.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves and
sleep spindles.



Right facial twitching was accompanied by muscle artifact but no associated epileptiform cerebral
activity was seen.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.






OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 68 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
