HISTORY:

90 y.o. female with a history of r pontine meningioma with mass effect, L frontal
encephalomalacia, R gaze deviation and obtundation referred for routine EEG for screening for
subclinical seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Keppra



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal/ tactile  Stimulation.  The patient is somnolent,
but not intubated.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is abnormal, asymmetric and  characterized by a low voltage suppressed pattern on
the right. The left is primarily 4-5 theta and delta activity, sharply contoured




Generalized slowing is present.


Focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional /Intermittent  T3, C3


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

Tactile stimulation elicits an increase in theta/delta on the right.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of  96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Irregular.

IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:


1. Markedly slow and lower voltage pattern on the right

2. Slow but theta background on the left with intermittent sharp waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings  are suggestive of a potentially epileptiform focus on the left.  The right hemisphere is
markedly slow.  Given the concerns for subtle seizures, EEG monitoring will follow.
