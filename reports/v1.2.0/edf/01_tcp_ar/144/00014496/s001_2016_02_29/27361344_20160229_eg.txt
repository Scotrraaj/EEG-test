HISTORY:

60 YO MALE P/W LEFT SIDED WEAKNESS. NO SPEECH

OR VISION CHANGES. H/O SZ SINCE AGE OF 20 YEARS.


PMH: ASTHMA, HTN, SZ.

CTH- NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE. CHRONIC AREAS OF FOCAL

INFARCTION IN THE DEEP CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES (B/L)



MEDICATIONS:

ASA, LOVENOX, LISINOPRIL, KEPPRA, TRILEPTAL, THERAGRAN, LOVENOX,


TYLENOL




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the




International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The limited waking background is symmetric, reactive, and

consists of a mixture of low amplitude alpha and bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


However diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity

is also seen. Again limited wakefulness is characterized by a


symmetric and reactive low amplitude 11 Hertz posterior dominant

rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. A normal routine


EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication

effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
