HISTORY: 62 y.o. female with a history of HHNK, obtundation, abnormal Neuro exam referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures. Prior To LTM patient had paroxysmal L gaze deviation with nystagmus and unresponsiveness.   

MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: insulin regular 100 units in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion sodium chloride 0.45 % infusion sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units insulin regular (HumuLIN R,NovoLIN R) injection 7 Units levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB lactulose (CHRONULAC) solution 20 g dextrose 5 % and sodium chloride 0.45 % IV bolus  

SEDATION: None 

TECHNIQUE: A continuous video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.  DAY 1 (8/25/2016- 8/26/2016, 06:00)  

BACKGROUND: The waking background is markedly abnormal, with a bi-hemispheric low voltage slow pattern, more suppressed on the left. As the EEG continues, there is eye movement, variability in the record and intermittent symmetric theta, alternating with a suppressed pattern. This transition to a theta pattern in the overnight hours, and by the AM 8/26 the EEG is symmetric with 7.75 Hz PDR.  

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  

EVENTS: None  

EKG: A single lead captured HR 80 BPM 

DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: Initially markedly slow and asymmetric background with marked improvement over time.  Nearly normal background by the end
