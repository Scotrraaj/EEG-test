HISTORY:

62 y.o. female with a history of schizophrenia, Hep C, HHNK. Glucose now in
range but obtunded with L gaze deviation and nystagmus referred for routine EEG for screening for
subclinical seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


insulin regular 100 units in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion

sodium chloride 0.45 % infusion

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg


ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg

heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

lactulose retention enema




insulin regular (HumuLIN R,NovoLIN R) injection 7 Units

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.  Patient is somnolent.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The  background is characterized by a diffusely slow pattern, with a markedly suppressed pattern on
the left, low voltage delta/theta. On the right and in central regions there is intermittent rhythmic
theta.




Marked generalized slowing is present.

Focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  Stimulation of the patient produces some periodic slowing R>L

EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal ICU routine EEG due to:


1. Markedly slow background

2. Asymmetry- more suppressed on the left



CLINICAL CORRELATION:




These findings should be correlated with imaging and current exam. Given the exam findings earlier
today, LTM is recommended.
