DATE OF STUDY: 08/15/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 1 hour, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 37 y.o. MALE PRESENTS WITH TRAUMATIC SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE
WITHOUT LOC. EEG TO R/O SZ



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet 2 tablet

oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet 1 tablet


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 500 mg

potassium, sodium phosphates (PHOS-NAK) packet 1 packet

lidocaine-epinephrine 1 %-1:100,000 injection 5 mL


ondansetron (ZOFRAN) tablet 8 mg

ondansetron (ZOFRAN) tablet 8 mg

nicotine (NICODERM CQ) patch 21 mg


diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) capsule 25 mg




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of  66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:




This is a normal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
