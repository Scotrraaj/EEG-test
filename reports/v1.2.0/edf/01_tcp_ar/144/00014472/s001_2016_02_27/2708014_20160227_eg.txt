HISTORY:  A 92-year-old woman with right PCA infarct, abrupt

onset today of drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and worsening of


left hemiparesis, found to have acute small right pontine

infarct.



MEDICINES:  Protonix, valsartan, others.


INTRODUCTION:  Bedside portable digital video EEG was performed


using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel

EKG.  This is primarily drowsy, but briefly awake record.  It is

technically satisfactory.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the

background EEG is diffusely slow, relatively low voltage.  There


is shifting asymmetry noted.  In some sections of the record,

particularly drowsiness, the EEG maybe slower on the left, low

voltage and more featureless.  Intermittent focal slowing may


also be seen in the right posterior quadrant.  There are handful

of bursts that sharply contoured delta from the right hemisphere.

Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response with a


glimpse of a 7-8 Hz alpha rhythm, better identified on the left




than the right.  The maximally waking background demonstrates of

a clear asymmetry with faster frequency activity on the left.


Brief sleep includes vertex waves.



Heart rate:  78 bpm.


IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:



Shifting slowing, more remarkable in the right hemisphere in

sleep.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.

These findings maybe correlated with this patient's clinical

picture and imaging.
