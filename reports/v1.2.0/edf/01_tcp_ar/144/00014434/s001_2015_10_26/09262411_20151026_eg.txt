History:	55 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF ? CVA YRS AGO NO TESTING, FEBRILE SZ, PSYCH ISSUES. NOTE PT HAIR MATTED IN BACK UNABLE TO GET ACCURATE MEASUREMENT AND VERY DIRTY.
Medications:	UNKNOWN Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. No sleep was captured

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation is not performed. HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake only. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
