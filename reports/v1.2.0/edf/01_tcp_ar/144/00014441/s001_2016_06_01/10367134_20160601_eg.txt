HISTORY:

64 y.o. female with a history of severe dementia, now presents with several
convulsions.



MEDICATIONS:


Depakote




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.


The background consists of a mixture of moderate amplitude theta and delta activity with underriding
low amplitude fast activity.



During sleep, subtle sleep spindles are captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Frequent rapid eye blinking artifact is present.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.






EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  Frequent premature QRS complexes are
seen on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate diffuse slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
