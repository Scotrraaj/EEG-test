carbonate 600 mg with Vitamin D3 200 unitsSig: 1 Tablet PO TIDDisp #90 (Patient taking
differently: as needed. Calcium carbonate 600 mg with Vitamin D3 200 unitsSig: 1 Tablet PO
TIDDisp #90)



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background consists of low to moderate amplitude diffuse prominent beta activity.


Patient remains awake throughout the study.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.



A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.


No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.




Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
