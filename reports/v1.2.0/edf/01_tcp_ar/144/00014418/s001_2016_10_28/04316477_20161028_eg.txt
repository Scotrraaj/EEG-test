SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of poorly organized low to medium voltage
7-8 Hertz activity over central and posterior scalp regions, poorly reactive to eye opening and closing.
Low voltage frontally predominant beta activity was seen with large amounts of eye blink artifact.
The patient was noted to exhibit chewing movements intermittently throughout the recording with
associated large amounts of muscle artifact.





During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 58 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Diffuse background slowing and disorganization.


2. Poor reactivity of posterior rhythmic activity to eye opening and closing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific and indicated a mild bihemispheric functional disturbance such as
that seen with a variety of mild generalized encephalopathies of various etiologies. No persistent
focal or lateralized slowing and no clinical or electrical seizure activity were recorded.
