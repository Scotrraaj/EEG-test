DATE OF STUDY: 05/13/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only





HISTORY:

a 31 y.o. female with a history of PEA and now coma.



MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.






The background is completely suppressed with no discernable electrical activity present.



No normal sleep architecture is seen



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal comatose EEG due to:

1. Complete burst suppression


2. Lack of the background reactivity.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


This is an isoelectric EEG was NOT performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the
determination of electrocerebral inactivity.
