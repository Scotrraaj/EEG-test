EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists primarily of diffuse low amplitude 
polymorphic delta activity with occasional polymorphic theta activity.  Patient remains awake 
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Patient moves and moans throughout 
the recording.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
	No epileptiform discharges

This is an ABNORMAL portable awake 23-minute EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse

dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Patient moves and moans throughout the recording.
