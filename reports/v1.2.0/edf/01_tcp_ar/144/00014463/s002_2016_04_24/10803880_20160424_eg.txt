START DATE OF STUDY: 04/24/16 at 11:46 END DATE OF STUDY: 04/25/16 at 08:46  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 56 y.o. male with a history of prior R temporoparietal infarct, HIV, HCV, who presented with L sided weakness and slurred speech as a stroke alert. Patient now referred for EEG for evaluation of episodes of generalized stiffening.  MEDICATIONS: None listed  SEDATION: none listed  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (4/24/2016, 11:46 - 4/25/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The background is continuous and reactive.  It consists of fairly organized low amplitude alpha, beta, and delta rhythms, with occasional fragments of an irregular posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz. There is continuous right posterior quadrant polymorphic slowing.  Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by further slowing of the background. Well-formed sleep transients are not seen.  There is mild to moderate generalized slowing. There is continuous right posterior quadrant polymorphic slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 60s.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Mild to moderate diffuse slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Continuous right posterior quadrant polymorphic slowing.  These findings are consistent with right posterior quadrant cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, superimposed on a mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.      -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (4/25/2016, 06:00 - 4/25/2016, 08:46)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change from day 1. No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.      -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Mild to moderate diffuse slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Continuous right posterior quadrant polymorphic slowing.    FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are consistent with right posterior quadrant cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, superimposed on a mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
