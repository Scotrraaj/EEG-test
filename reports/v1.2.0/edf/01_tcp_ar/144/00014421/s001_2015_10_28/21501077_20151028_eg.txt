Medications: Sedation:
â€¨53 year old woman with a history of events concerning for seizures. Their onset was about 1 year ago. In recent months their frequency increased to 2-3 events per month. no AEDs

EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
	
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11-11.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left temporal region. No clear epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates. A single EKG lead demonstrates regular heart rate.

Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, left temporal No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 28-minute EEG because of occasional mild focal slowing in the left temporal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non- specific, but possibly structural in origin.
