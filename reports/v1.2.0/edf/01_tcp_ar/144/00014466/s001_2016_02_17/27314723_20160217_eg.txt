HISTORY:

35 y.o. female with a history of

DIZZINESS AND BLACKOUT SPELLS  ONSET 2 YRS AGO, BECOMING MORE


frequent.  DIZZINESS 1-2 X A MONTH; referred for routine EEG for

evaluation of paroxysmal events. She reports episodes of near

syncope while in HD but she felt hot/ sweaty and with CP during


those episodes.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

cinacalcet (SENSIPAR) 30 mg tablet, Take 30 mg by mouth.

polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) 17 gram/dose powder, Take 17 g by


mouth as needed.

DOC-Q-LACE 100 mg capsule, Take 100 mg by mouth as needed.

calcium acetate (PHOSLO) 667 mg Capsule, Take 1,334 mg by mouth 3


times daily (with meals).




methimazole (TAPAZOLE) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth

daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 1 hour digital video21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record; though there was significant muscle artifact

and included a single channel of EKG, HVand photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.





Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  The patient

transitions in and out of stage II sleep.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


A single C3 spike was noted in stage II sleep, and differs in

morphology from the subject's more common vertex sharp waves



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: produces an increase in amplitude of the

background.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1 hour routine EEG.

While there is a single sharp wave, it must be considered an

artifact.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal 1 hour routine EEG.  The background is well

organized and  normal.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
