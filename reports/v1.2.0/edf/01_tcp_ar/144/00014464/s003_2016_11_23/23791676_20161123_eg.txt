SEDATION: fentanyl (received during the study) and propofol (stopped prior to the study)



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.



The background consists of attenuated slow delta activity without evidence of reactivity.




Large portions of the recording contain high amplitude marked EMG artifact over the lateral leads.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no change in the background activity to visual, auditory,
tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 120s-140s bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal comatose1 hour routine EEG due to:

1. Marked background slowing and attenuation without evidence of reactivity.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is etiologically nonspecific.


Large portions of the recording contain high amplitude marked EMG artifact over the lateral leads-
this limits interpretation of those regions when artifact is present.
