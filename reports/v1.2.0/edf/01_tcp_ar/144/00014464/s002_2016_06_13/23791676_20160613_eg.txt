HISTORY:

75 yo man had seizure at home and fell. Pt had another seizure in the
ED. Pt had back surgery and still has altered mental status.





MEDICATIONS:

Morphine, Hydralazine, Ofirmev, Acetaminophen, Insulin, Heparin, keppra, Famotidine, Atrovastatin,
ASA, Plavix, Amlodipine, Metoprolol, Dilantin



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to diffuse muscle artifact seen frequently and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:



No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate to severe diffuse slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal limited awake only routine EEG due to moderate to severe diffuse background
slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
