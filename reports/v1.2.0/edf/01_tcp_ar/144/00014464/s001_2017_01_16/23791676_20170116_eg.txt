DATE OF STUDY: 01/17/17 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only    HISTORY: a 76 y.o. MALE WITH PMHX OF SEIZURES AND SDH.  PRESENTS FROM NURSING HOME WITH SZS, 2' TO UTI AND SUB THERAPEUTIC DRUG LEVELS. .  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: valproic acid (as sodium salt) (DEPAKENE) 500 mg/10 mL (10 mL) solution 1,000 mg sodium bicarbonate tablet 650 mg aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 4 Units amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 80 mg carvedilol (COREG) tablet 6.25 mg docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 7 Units pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet tamsulosin (FLOMAX) 24 hr capsule 0.8 mg dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN) 2 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited due to patient movement record and included a single channel of EKG.   EEG BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta and tetha activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Sleep is not captured  Moderate generalized slowing is present.     EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate generalized slowing is present.    CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
