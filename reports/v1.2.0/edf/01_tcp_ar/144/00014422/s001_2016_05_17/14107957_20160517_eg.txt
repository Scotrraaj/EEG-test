DATE OF STUDY: 05/17/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 34 y.o. female with a history of recent possible seizure  referred for routine EEG for
evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


buPROPion (WELLBUTRIN SR) 150 mg 12 hr tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH DAILY FOR THE
1ST THREE DAYS THEN TAKE 1 TABLET TWICE DAILY


oxybutynin (DITROPAN) 5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

FLUOXETINE HCL (PROZAC PO), Take  by mouth.

ZOLPIDEM TARTRATE (AMBIEN PO), Take  by mouth.


CLONAZEPAM PO, Take  by mouth.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:




A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG , HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 12 Hertz , 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Generous beta was noted.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: produces an increase in amplitude



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding. Supraharmonic driving was seen.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A  Regular heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:






This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Generous beta may be due to the current medicines.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
