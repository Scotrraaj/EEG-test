HISTORY:

This is a 50 y.o.female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring
with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.



She notes first episode was in July and passed out for about 40 minutes (which was the longest).
Other episodes lasted only minutes. Last thing, she remembers is getting into the car and the next
thing she remembers is waking up and being at home (had to be carried out of the car) THE NEXT
DAY. She was trembling while in the car. This was witnessed by ex-boyfriend and doesn't know much
of the information.











She notes since July episodes are shorter about couple minutes where she passes out and shivers all
over and afterwards she doesn't know where she is. Brother saw episode where looks around and than
doesn't respond and has fine tremors all over body. She knows the events are coming because she
feels sweaty and gets double vision/blurry vision. Headache almost every time she has event.




Brother notes there are many variety of events unsure of specifics.


Types:

1. Trembling, has to sit down or may fall, but able to get herself back up (happens 2 times a week)

2. Episodes during which she stares and doesn't talk (? Unsure of frequency)


3. Episodes during which she talks to brother and mother and is combative or slurred in speech (?
Unsure of frequency)




She had 3 spells in July and August, 4 in September than started Topamax. October had only 2
episodes. (Last event middle of October). She later said that she has an event at least once per week.




She notes that trembling happens especially at rest all over the body and happens at least once a
day. Usually right side (arm and leg) and now is both sides. Trembling started about 1 year ago. She
notes trembling increases with anxiety and is fine tremors that occur mostly at rest. She takes Ativan
TID for years for anxiety





She notes that has had one whole day which does not remember at all.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.


Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:


- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.


- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;



- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;

- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patientÂ’s exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:







A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

------------------------------------------------------

INDUCTION PROCEDURES:

Sleep deprivation


Exercise


SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:


Interictal Findings:

None





Ictal Findings:


The patient had one clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the
epilepsy monitoring unit. This event had no EEG correlate.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Possible simple partial seizures and complex partial seizures vs non epileptic events




EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:


1. Possible localization related epilepsy


CONCLUSION:


was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 6 days with continuous video
EEG.  This was an nondiagnostic EMU monitoring session because of no events with loss of
consciousness were captured.  The patient was weaned off topiramate and ativan over the course of
her admission. S/he was restarted on his/her medication on the day prior to his/her discharge from the
hospital. No other medication changes were made during the hospitalization. The event captured
during the study had no EEG correlate and as such may represent simple partial seizures which may
only have an EEG correlate 25% of the time or alternatively it may represent a non-epileptic
psycogenic event.







Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
