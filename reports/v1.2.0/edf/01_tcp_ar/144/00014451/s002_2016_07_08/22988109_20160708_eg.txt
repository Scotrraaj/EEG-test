HISTORY:

71 y.o. female with a history of seizures, chronic ischemic changes,
possible CNS Mets,  referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change. Known is
encephalomalacia in the inferior right frontal lobe consistent with chronic right anterior MCA infarct,
increasingly confluent.




MEDICATIONS:

Dilantin


TECHNIQUE:

A bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.  There
is electrode artifact.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by a low voltage, featureless pattern with eye movements,
low voltage delta and smaller amounts of beta



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not otherwise defined.

Moderate generalized slowing is present.


No major focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: verbal stimuli produces brief alerting and some bilateral theta.


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Marked background slowing, low voltage pattern.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific  frequently found in association with a diffuse disorder of cerebral
function.  Post ictal state or toxic-metabolic encephalopathy may play a role. There were no
epileptiform features.
