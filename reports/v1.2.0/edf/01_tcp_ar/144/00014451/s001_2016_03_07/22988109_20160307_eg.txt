DATE OF STUDY: 03/07/2016

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, lethargic





HISTORY:

a 70 y.o. female PRESENTS WITH H/O ALTERED

MENTAL STATUS, FOUND LESS RESPONSIVE AND NOT MOVING LT SIDE. PT


KNOWN TO HAVE RT SIDED FLACID PARALYSIS





MEDICATIONS:

VANCOMYCIN, CIPRO



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was record was at the beginning technically




limited due to a diffuse myogenic artifact and included a single

channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present.


Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta and theta

activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior


gradient of frequencies.



Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology

are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms

demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.



Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Triphasic waves

2. Moderate diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings of frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and

moderate diffuse background slowing are indicative of a severe

diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but

suggestive of a metabolic origin.
