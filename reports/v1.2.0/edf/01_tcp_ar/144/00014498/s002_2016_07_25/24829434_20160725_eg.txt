HISTORY:

52 YR OLD MALE R HANDED. PT ADMITTED FOR SURGERY TODQAY AVR.



MEDICATIONS:

Nonw



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



INCISION 8:52 AM


BOVE 8:53 AM

HEPARIN 9;36 AM,9;41 AM, 9;54 AM

INCISION IN FRONT OF CHEST 9:33 AM




BOVIE 9;34 AM

BLOOD BANK CALLED 9:42 AM


CLOTTING FACTOR 290

TARGET 28



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




This background becomes progressively slow and symmetrically attenuated with intermittent burst
suppression. A around 12Pm it is almost completely attenuated. It the slowly becomes more
continuous and faster frequencies return.




Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of  66bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is an uneventful intraoperative EEG during AVR surgery.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
