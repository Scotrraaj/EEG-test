HISTORY:

48 y.o. MAN p/w Parameoplastic encephalitis. Pt was hooked up to LTM 7/25-
7/26. Follow up EEG



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

SEDATION: see above.


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record
due to sweat artifact and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.



There are intermittent burst of diffuse beta seen.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Severe generalized slow waves


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal routine EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
