HISTORY: 48 y.o. male with a history of systemic follicular B cell lymphoma and bowel resection (2015) referred for routine EEG for evaluation of altered mental status and choreiform movements.   MEDICATIONS: fentanyl drip, versed drip, Benadryl, others  SEDATION: as above  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (7/25/2016, 16:45 - 7/26/2016, 08:13)  BACKGROUND: *at start of study, Versed is at 10 mg/hr  The waking background is symmetric, but poorly organized and consists of diffusely attenuated delta activity. There is no reactivity or state change. Rarely, the background is variable, with <3 min periods of diffuse disorganized theta and alpha.  Severe generalized slowing is present. There is no focal slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 100s  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing, with lack of reactivity  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may at least in part be due to a medication effect.
