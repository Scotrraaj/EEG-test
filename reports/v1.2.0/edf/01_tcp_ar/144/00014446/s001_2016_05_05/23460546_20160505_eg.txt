HISTORY:

73 y.o. male with a history of heart disease, had an amnestic spell referred
for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 25 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

rosuvastatin (CRESTOR) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


clopidogrel (PLAVIX) 75 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

isosorbide mononitrate (IMDUR) 30 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth  daily

aspirin (BAYER) 325 mg Tablet tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and verbalstimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  There is generous beta







Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.


If epilepsy is an important consideration, please consider a more prolonged steady in the lab,
capturing sleep.
