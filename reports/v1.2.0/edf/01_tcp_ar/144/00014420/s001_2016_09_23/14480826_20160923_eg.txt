PMH of CAD s/p 3 stents, DM, HTN, HLD



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

nitroGLYCERIN (NITROSTAT) SL tablet 0.4 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 8 Units

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units


pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg

aspirin EC tablet 81 mg



amLODIPine (NORVASC) half tablet 2.5 mg

hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) tablet 25 mg


metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 24 hr tablet 50 mg




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha/theta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
There is mainly diffuse 5-7Hz activity and patient rapidly goes into sleep.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

1. Mild diffuse generalized slow waves


2. Short sleep latency



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to mild background slowing and slow alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


The short sleep latency may be indicative of a sleep disturbance. No seizures or epileptiform activity
was seen.
