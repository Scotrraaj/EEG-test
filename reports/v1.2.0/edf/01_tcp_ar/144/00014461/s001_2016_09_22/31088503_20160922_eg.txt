HISTORY: 48 y.o. Male- yesterday 9/21 at 11 am he coded on the floor, rhythm was asystole and then V tach for at least 30 minutes with multiple rounds of epinephrine. After ROSC patient required 3 pressors. Cardiology was called and they did a bedside echo that showed a dilated RV with strain which was accounted to a possible massive Pulmonary Embolism. He was never on sedation. Not hypothermic but BP 70/40 with multiple pressors.   Primary team noted absence of gag and corneal reflex and asked for the brain dead exam referred for routine EEG for brain death evaluation.  

MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: phenylephrine (NEO-SYNEPHRINE) 80 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL infusion potassium chloride IVPB 20 mEq 100 mL potassium chloride IVPB 20 mEq 100 mL potassium phosphate 30 mmol in dextrose 5 % in water 250 mL IVPB pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units heparin 25,000 units (100 units/mL) in 0.45% sodium chloride 250 mL infusion (Premix) potassium chloride IVPB 20 mEq 100 mL magnesium sulfate IVPB 4 g 100 mL HYDROmorphone (DILAUDID) 1 mg/mL PCA infusion 50 mL And naloxone (NARCAN) injection 0.4 mg vasopressin (PITRESSIN) 100 Units in dextrose 5 % in water 250 mL infusion sodium bicarbonate injection 100 mEq norepinephrine (LEVOPHED) 16 mg/250 mL (64 mcg/mL) in NSS infusion EPINEPHrine (ADRENALIN) 4 mg in dextrose 5 % in water 250 mL infusion niCARdipine (CARDENE) 20 mg in NaCl (iso-os) 200 mL infusion vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+ piperacillin-tazobactam (ZOSYN) 3.375 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB MB+ DOBUTamine (DOBUTREX) 500 mg in dextrose 5 % water 250 mL infusion hydrocortisone sod succ (PF) (Solu-CORTEF) injection 100 mg morphine injection 1 mg 

SEDATION: None 

TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and Tactile/ Verbal stimulation. This standard ECS montage was used for 30 minutes. Tactile and verbal stimulation were performed, and the technologist confirm the integrity of the system  

EEG BACKGROUND: The background is suppressed. No cerebral activity was identified 

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no change to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli. 

EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  

HEART RATE: A heart rate of 104 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal 50 minute ICUEEG due to: 1. Absence of cerebral activity 

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings, recorded >24 hours after cardiac arrest, in the absence of the use of sedative hypnotic medications or hypothermia support a severe disturbance of cerebral function. This EEG demonstrates electrocerebral inactivity (ECS). Correlation with overall clinical picture is advised.
