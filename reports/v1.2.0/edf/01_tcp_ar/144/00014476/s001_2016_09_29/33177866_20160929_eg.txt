SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by intermittent
rhythmic diffuse delta and at times theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.




Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Moderate diffuse slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to moderate diffuse background slowing and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
