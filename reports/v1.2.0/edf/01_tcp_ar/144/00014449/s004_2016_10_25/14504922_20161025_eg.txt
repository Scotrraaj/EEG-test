HISTORY:

82 y.o. female with a history of massive R ICH, GCS = 3 referred for routine
EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg

piperacillin-tazobactam (ZOSYN) 3.375 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB MB+


vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+

ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg

labetalol (NORMODYNE,TRANDATE) injection 10 mg


docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg

senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet



multivitamin liquid 5 mL

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is characterized an essentially suppressed pattern on the right. There is some
continuous mixed frequency activity on the left, more anteriorly




generalized slowing is present.

Continuous Right  focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

In addition to discrete L frontal sharps, spikes, and L periodic complexes, electrographic seizures of
15-30 seconds are noted with build up of sharp waves and then fast activity and abrupt cessation. No
clinical features were noted.




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile stimulation does not activate the record


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical  events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 86 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal coma  EEG due to:

1. Electrographic status epilepticus seen in a comatose patient without discernable clinical change
noted on EEG or by bedside examine.


2. Suppressed pattern contralateral to epileptiform focus

CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Severe brain injury with seizures emanating from  Cortex contralateral to the hemorrhage


These findings were related to the clinical team.
