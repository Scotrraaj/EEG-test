HISTORY:

65 y.o. male with a history of possible seizure referred for routine EEG for
evaluation of paroxysmal events.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is mildly disorganized and characterized by excess intermittent theta activity.
This is more prominent over the left temporal region. There is a fragmentary 8Hz Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
disorganized.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Generalized slowing is present.

Left temporal focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.





Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 70-80 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. There are intermittent ectopic beats
observed.




IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Diffuse slowing


2. Focal left temporal slowing.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of a possible structural brain lesion in the left hemisphere.
Diffuse slowing may be seen in toxic-metabolic encephalopathies. There were no clinical or
electrographic seizures seen.
