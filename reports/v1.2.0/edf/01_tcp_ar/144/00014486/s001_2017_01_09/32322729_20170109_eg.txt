TECHNIQUE:

A STAT bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using
the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal  Stimulation.  This
is a frail-looking adult, but he is frequently awake



BP (!) 141/81 (BP Location: Left arm, Patient Position: Lying)  Pulse 84  Temp 98.2 F (36.8 C)
(Oral)  Resp 18  Ht 5' 10" (1.778 m)  Wt 98 lb 8.7 oz (44.7 kg)  SpO2 96%  BMI 14.14 kg/m2



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of low to medium voltage, diffuse theta
pattern.  Patient is compliant, looks about and she is quite slow.  There is variability to the flow
pattern and at times there is a bit more faster theta / alpha frequency activity as well as some delta



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements,and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not otherwise characterized



Moderate to marked generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: not done



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 80-90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1.  Generalized background slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are most supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  There are features
to suggest that this is a chronic process.  This is a dynamic record and there are portions of the record
with a bit more alpha frequency activity.  There were no epileptiform features; no seizures were
recorded
