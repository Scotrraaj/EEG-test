HISTORY:

54 y.o. male with a history of posterior circulation CVA, admitted with increasing
vertigo, then unresponsive this AM with worsening L sided weakness but no new CVA on CT referred
for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.

TECHNIQUE:


A STAT portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by a poorly organized asymmetric
mixture of theta, alpha and beta frequencies, with a 5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) present
bilaterally. With maximal stimulation, PDR achieves 7 Hz. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient
of frequency and amplitude is not preserved in this study.Sleep is not well defined.





Generalized slowing is present throughout the study in the L>R frontocentral region.

Intermittent shifting focal slowing is present L>R.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile stimulation produces minimal arousal and minimal EEG
changes.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 92 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. The heart rate is irregular.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized slowing present in the L>R frontocentral region


2. Shifting focal slowing present L>R

3. Tactile stimulation produces minimal arousal and minimal EEG changes




4. Heart rhythm is irregular



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

The patient's mental status appears to be more severe than that predicted by this EEG study. This
phenomenon can be seen in acute encephalopathy. These findings may also be correlated with
neuroanatomical deficits. There were no epileptiform features.
