CLINICAL HISTORY: A 78-year-old male, who had a seizure on October 24th, found on the floor with the fetal position, foaming at the mouth, eyes open with lip smacking movements and had convulsion in the emergency room that day.
MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was deferred. Photic stimulation was completed. This is an awake and a sleep record. Artifact was noted in some sections of the record
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The waking background includes a dynamic pattern. Some sections of the waking background include a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with overall good organization. In wakefulness with a posterior dominant rhythm, there were intermittent bursts of rhythmic frontal delta
{FIRDA). Intermittent bursts of shifting slowing can be seen in wakefulness and early drowsiness. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta as well as an accentuation of the bursts of rhythmic frontal delta. Stage 2 sleep was not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving at intermediate flash frequencies.
A single right temporal sharp wave was identified in the transition to drowsiness. This discharge is seen in the context of electrode artifact.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to;
	•	FIRDA.
	•	Prominent bursts of shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The FIRDA as described above is a nonspecific finding, which can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. The shifting slowing may be correlated with clinical history. Only a single sharp wave was noted, and this discharge is concerning for artifact. In this individual with new onset seizures, a more prolonged study may be helpful to identify epileptiform features.
