HISTORY:


72 y.o. MAN WHO HAD LTM 12/26 FOR

JERKY MM WHILE IN HOSP FOR CABG.  NOW FOR FOLLOW UP EEG AS OP.




MEDICATIONS:

CLOPIDOGREL, METOPROLOL, LEVEMIR, LISINOPRIL, ATORVASTATIN,


GABAPENTIN, TEMAZEPAM, INSULIN, LEVOFLLAXACIN, AMLODIPINE, ASA,

NOBUMETONE, TIZANEDINE, MECLIZINE, OMEPRAZOLE, METFORMIN,

BISACODYL



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system ith T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the T3

region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Intermittent focal slowing in the left mid-temporal region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to

intermittent focal slowing in the left mid-temporal region.  This

finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is

etiologically non-specific.
