HISTORY:

54 y.o. male with a history of fatigue, culminating in TC seizure, found to
Have glucose = 900,  referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

SEDATION: ativan on presentation



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. This is a low voltage
study




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous  sleep spindles and rare,
symmetric vertex waves,and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile stimulation produces an alerting.

EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:




This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Slowing of the alpha rhythm.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are frequently found in association with toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. There are
no epileptiform features.
