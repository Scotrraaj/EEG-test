SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.




During drowsiness, more pronounced diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Mild diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
