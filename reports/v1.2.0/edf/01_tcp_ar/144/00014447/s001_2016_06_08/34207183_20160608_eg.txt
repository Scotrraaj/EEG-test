HISTORY:

26 y.o. female with a history of a single seizure.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


BUSPIRONE HCL (BUSPAR PO), Take 50 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

IBUPROFEN (MOTRIN PO), Take  by mouth.

NORTRIPTYLINE HCL (NORTRIPTYLINE PO), Take 125 mg by mouth at bedtime.


SULFAMETHOXAZOLE/TRIMETHOPRIM (BACTRIM PO), Take  by mouth.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None






TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During intermittent brief drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of
the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

- No epileptiform discharges

- no stage II sleep





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG.



No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
