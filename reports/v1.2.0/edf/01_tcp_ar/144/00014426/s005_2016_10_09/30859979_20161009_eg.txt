Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:



- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patient's exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is  symmetric and reaches 10 Hz.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured..



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness noted over the left> R temporal region

SEIZURES/EVENTS:


There are  Clinical seizures  captured during this study.  The patient was able to push the button for
both, she had bilateral motor activity with preserved awareness, though the first was noted out of
sleep


1. 810  AM 30 seconds - the patient had a headache and was sleeping.  She has an ice pack on her
head and her body is under the covers.  She seems to be awakened by motor activity.  Under the
covers, both hands can be seen trembling, trembling-like.  And she reaches for the button.  In
addition, as she reaches for the button there appears to be tonic extension of the right leg followed
by right arm.  Fencer posture can be seen under the covers at 8:10:26. The nurse enters as the
seizure ends, R leg still extended, R arm flexed. There is no impairment of awareness after the event




EEG: There seems to be an arousal out of stage II sleep.  In the first 3 seconds of the seizure, there is
a burst of delta/theta noted at the midline.  Despite significant artifact, there seems to be a repetitive
discharge noted at the midline, identified best in an average reference with fast activity at FZ.  As
the patient presses the button there is underlying rhythmic theta noted at the midline with bifrontal
fast activity.By 8:10:27 there is clear evolution of the midline activity transitioning to delta frequency
activity.  There is very little in the way of postictal slowing in the EEG quickly returns to a normal
awake background with symmetric reactive alpha and generous beta




2. 5:56 PM 1:22 out of wakefulness patient is awake sitting up in bed.  This seizure has the same
motoric features.  Her arms, and initially, she has peculiar fluttering movements of both hands
followed by tonic extension of the right leg tonic extension of the right arm, eye deviation to the right
and then fencer  posturing.  Patient is responsive during the seizure and complaining of pain.  She
is given a code word which she is able to recall.








EEG: This seizure is also very challenging with a lot of muscle artifact and is best delineated using
an average reference.  There is a burst of rhythmic high amplitude 3-4 Hz activity in the midline
maximum at CZ at the onset of the seizure.  This is accompanied by fast activity.  6 seconds after the
onset of the seizure, there is clear tonic clonic muscle artifact. At 5:56:33 as the activity continues,
very is more well-defined delta noted in the left central parietal electrodes.



The activity slows, as is characteristic of a tonic-clonic seizure and there is excess beta noted
following the event.  The postictal record is remarkable for generous beta however, the patient was
also suffering with an exacerbation of her migraine headaches and receiving medications which
could produce those findings



Heart rate 120 during the event, sustained afterwards


EKG: A single lead captured HR 90BPM


Day 2 Impression/clinical correlation



Although there are no interictal epileptiform discharges, when these 2 events are reviewed together,
it is clear that these is a characteristic appearance of a supplementary motor seizure with fencer
posturing.  The EEG is very challenging, but when reviewed with specific montages, the activity
seems to be arising from the midline in the central region,

INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reaches 10 Hz.Sleep is characterized by
normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-
complexes. Slow wave sleep was  captured..






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY Questionable Pz sharps in transition to SWS



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Rhythmic mid-temporal theta of
drowsiness noted over the temporal regions (L>R, tagged by the tech)



SEIZURES/EVENTS:


There 2  clinical seizures captured during this study and one aura.

11:59 AM - patient feels like she might have a seizure  there was a 3 second burst of midline 3-4 Hz
activity, Cz Max followed by an arousal, she pushes the button within 8 seconds of the first EEG
change and is awake alert and interactive with the nurses.  An alpha rhythm is noted as soon as she is
able to push the button



12:27 PM 01:42 duration - this event is identical to previous prolonged seizure- she is awake, she
pushes the button within 3 seconds of the first ictal change.  The right arm and leg are moving.  The
Hand flutter precedes fencer posture  her head turns to the right.  She is initially somewhat
responsive to the tech  just in the beginning of the seizure. She has clear tonic clonic activity but
partially preserved awareness. She is not able to answer at the end of the seizure but then recalls the
code word


EEG: The ictal pattern is similar to the 2 previous seizures with midline predominant 4 Hz activity
maximum CZ PZ more than Fz, at 12:38:06 the rhythmic activity seems to be in the left central
parietal region more than the right but there is a great deal of artifact, tonic clonic muscle artifact is
noted in the last 30 seconds of the seizure followed by generalized beta and some slowing



EKG sustained tachycardia >130 BPM after the event



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:

Interictal Findings:


Paucity of interictal dischareges


Ictal Findings:


The patient had 4 clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the
epilepsy monitoring unit. Two were prolonged, associated with sustained tachycardia.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Supplementary motor seizures with sterotypic semiology and clear ictal pattern discernable with
Avg reference and 35 Hz filter.


Seizures start Cz Pz and in then move to C3/P3.



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Focal onset epilepsy





CONCLUSION: Medically intractable epilepsy


The patient had a discussion about these epileptic events and the next steps in
this work up including a more detailed MRI, PET and MEG


After this data is acquired she will be presented at surgical conference to discuss the possibility of
intracranial monitoring / electrocorticography as a next step in her surgical evaluation.



Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
