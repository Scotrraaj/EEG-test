HISTORY:

59 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O RT SIDED WEAKNESS, APHASIC. S/P FALL
NOTED WITH 3 MIN GEN T/C SZ WITH BLADDER INCONT.



MEDICATIONS:


DEPAKOTE


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a mixture of alpha and beta frequencies
seen best over the right hemisphere, with an asymmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR)  that at best reaches 9Hertz . The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is present over the right. However there is excessive 5-7 Hz diffuse activity in wakefulness.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



There is continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the
fronto-central region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. There is an associated loss of
faster frequencies over this region.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 42 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Left hemispheric focal slow waves maximal over the fronto-central region and associated loss of
faster frequencies


2. Mild diffuse slow


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the left
hemispheric focal slow waves maximal over the fronto-central region with associated loss of faster
frequencies.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely
structural in origin. In addition there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is non-
specific with regards to etiology.
