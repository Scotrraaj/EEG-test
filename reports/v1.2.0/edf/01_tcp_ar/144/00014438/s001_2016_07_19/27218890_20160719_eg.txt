SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
sharply contoured alpha and excess of beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

Occasional subtle left temporal polymorphic slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Occasional left temporal sharp waves are seen in drowsiness. These have an appearance most
consistent with wicket waves, a benign variant.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.







Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Occasional subtle left temporal polymorphic slowing

2. Occasional left temporal sharp waves are seen in drowsiness. These have an appearance most
consistent with wicket waves, a benign variant.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of left temporal cerebral dysfunction, structural or physiologic in
etiology.


The left temporal sharp waves described above are most consistent with a benign variant based on
appearance.
