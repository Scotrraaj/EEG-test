HISTORY:

23 y.o. male with a history of single seizure while shaving.  EEG in 2014 with 5-6
Hz spikes,  referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

levetiracetam (KEPPRA XR) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, TAKE 2 TABLETS BY MOUTH DAILY.

TECHNIQUE:


A  1hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International
10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically acceptable
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.  There are electrode
issues and had rocking artifact noted in the record




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is  not sustained



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Artifacts are noted in the record during both of the procedures



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal 1 hour awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic
events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
