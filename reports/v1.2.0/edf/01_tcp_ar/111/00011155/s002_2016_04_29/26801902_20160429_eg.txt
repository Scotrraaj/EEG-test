SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


Bed side Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile and verbal
stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND: The overall background is low voltage and slow.  With tactile stimulation, there
is a brief alerting with a 5-7 Hz theta background.  When the patient is unstimulated, she drifts off to
sleep with vertex waves




Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile and auditory stimulation elicits an alerting response



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. generalized slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are nonspecific but are frequently found in association with toxic or metabolic
encephalopathy or other diffuse cerebral process.  No epileptiform features were seen.  Previous EEG
not available for comparison
