HISTORY: 25 y.o. male with a history of seizures, now presents with worsening cognitive slowing.    MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: divalproex (DEPAKOTE DR) tablet 500 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 1,000 mg   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (12/6/2016 - 12/7/2016)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well-organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.5-10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Excessive 5-7 Hz activity is present in wakefulness.  During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep was not captured.  Patient gradually pulls all of the leads off by ~ 2 am.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured heart rate of 60 bpm.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal ~12 hour long term video EEG due to: Mild diffuse slowing  This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.   Patient gradually pulls all of the leads off by ~ 2 am, so no meaningful recording is captured after that.    -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (12/7/2016-12/8/2016)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured regular heart rate  Pt intermittently disconnects his leads and several leads only produce artifact by the end of the recording   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  This 24 hour recording demonstrates the background similar to the day #1 of the recording (mild diffuse slowing).  No events are captured.
