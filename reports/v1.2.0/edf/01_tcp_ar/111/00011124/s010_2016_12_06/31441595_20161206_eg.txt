HISTORY: 25 y.o. male p/w lack of coordination and difficulty forming sentences. Last seizure was 1 month ago. Diagnosed at the age of 12. PMH: MR.   TUH EEG: 2/2014 mild diffuse slowing  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 1,000 mg divalproex (DEPAKOTE DR) tablet 500 mg divalproex (DEPAKOTE DR) tablet 1,000 mg    SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well-organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Excessive 5-7 Hz activity is present in wakefulness.  During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  Mild generalized slowing is present.     EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.   EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: 1. Mild generalized slowing  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing.  This finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
