HISTORY:

53 y.o. MALE  PRESNTS WITH SZ X 2 HX,  PMHX SIG FOR  STROKES X 2 IN
1998, DX WITH SARCOIDOSIS.



MEDICATIONS:


DEPAKOTE, PHENOBARBITAL


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







A poorly formed posterior dominant rhythm that at best reached 8 Hz was present only on the left
hemisphere. Background activity was characterized by mainly diffuse low voltage delta and theta
activity with an disrganized anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. Some infrequent normal
fronto central beta can be seen.  Diffuse, 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. However there was an
attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere maximal in the centro-temporal region.





Normal sleep is not captured, however clear state changes with sleep could be seen.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



1. Right centro-temporal loss of faster frequencies

2. Moderate diffuse slowing

3. Excess beta




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and sleep routine EEG due to right centrotemporal loss of faster
frequencies, which is indicative of structural cortical dysfunction. In addition there is moderate diffuse
background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators
of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
