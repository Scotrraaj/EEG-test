SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric.


The right hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of alpha, theta, and delta, with fragments
of a posterior dominant rhythm of 7-8 Hz.


The left hemisphere consists of a poorly organized mixture of theta and delta posteriorly, with higher
amplitude delta and admixed sharply contoured fast frequency activity over the left fronto-temporal
region (F3 maximum), most consistent with breach rhythm. Posterior dominant rhythm is seen less
clearly on the left.




During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and further
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.


Mild generalized slowing is present.


Continuous left hemispheric polymorphic slowing and attenuation (latter is best seen posteriorly) are
present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) left fronto-temporal (F7>T3) spike-and-wave



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Continuous left hemispheric polymorphic slowing and attenuation (latter best seen posteriorly)

3. Left frontal breach rhythm


4. Frequent left fronto-temporal (F7 max) spike-and-wave



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of left hemispheric dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and
left fronto-temporal epileptogenic discharges superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


The left frontal breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known history of left frontal skull defect.
