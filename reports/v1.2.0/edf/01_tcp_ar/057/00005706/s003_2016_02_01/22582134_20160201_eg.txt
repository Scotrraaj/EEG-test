HISTORY:

55 y.o. Male WITH PMHX OF TBI 1993. RIGHT

CEREBRAL ENCEPHALOMALACIE, SEIZURES, COPD HTN.  PRESENTS TO


EPISCOPAL SZS, GTC 5-6.




MEDICATIONS:

TEGRETOL, KEPPRA




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right


hemisphere maximal in the F8/F4 region during wakefulness,

increasing during drowsiness. There is an associated breach in

this region.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximal in


the frontal region

2. Breach rhythm


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to

continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximal in the


frontal region with an associated breach.  These findings are

indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region and

consistent with the history of TBI.
