HISTORY:

27 y.o. male with a history of medically refractory epilepsy, now presents with
increase in seizure frequency.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 500 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. Indications:
Epilepsy


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.



The background consists of a mixture of diffuse excess beta activity and frequent bifrontal moderate
amplitude prominent semi-rhythmic and rhythmic primarily 4-5 Hz activity that becomes more
pronounced during drowsiness.    This activity does not evolve.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Bifrontal rhythmic focal slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This pattern is of unknown clinical significance and has been seen on many prior EEG.  It is
suggestive of bifrontal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.




Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.



No electrographic seizures are captured.
