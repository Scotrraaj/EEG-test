current facility-administered medications for this visit: Amytal 125 mg





TECHNIQUE:

Continuous video electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system
with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system.  This standard operative montage was utilized.
This was a technically satisfactory study.  If physician was present in the angiography suite throughout
the duration of the recording.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  There is a small amount of theta noted



Intermittent paroxysmal bilateral theta was seen.


RICA injection: The angiogram demonstrated right persistent fetal circulation

Time 1:58 PM

This produced a great deal of muscle and movement artifact but underneath this, rhythmic slowing
from the right hemisphere was noted at 1:59:53.  The study was called unilateral and testing was
performed.  Focal features in the right hemisphere were relatively mild.  In addition, there was a
great deal of muscle artifact noted in both hemispheres



The EEG gradually returned to baseline and testing was completed.

Score 0/9


LCA injection: The angiogram demonstrated no persistent fetal circulation; i.e. No fillng of the L
PCA.
Time 2:40 PM

This produced initially bilateral slowing but then more dramatic left focal slowing at 2:40;25 The
EEG  Gradually returned to baseline and testing was completed.


Score: 0.5/9



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Injection of each carotid artery produced focal features in the EEG, ipsilateral to the injection.
Features were transient and by the end of the study at 3 PM the EEG had returned to baseline.


Clinically, the patient was hemiplegic with each injection.  She was aphasic with the injection on the
left.  Please refer to the neuropsychological report for the overall Wada score.



Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
