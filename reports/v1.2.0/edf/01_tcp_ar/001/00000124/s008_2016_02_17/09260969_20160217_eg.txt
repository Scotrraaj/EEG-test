HISTORY:

This is a 68 y.o. RH woman with seizures since age 6.



Type 1: Staring spells for 2 minutes and post ictal confusion for

30min. Denies TB and bladder incontinence. Current frequency 3


times per week.

Type 2: ? T-C



Epilepsy Risk Factors: Her niece and nephew with seizures.


No complications during birth. Denies a history of head trauma,


previous CNS infection, febrile seizures or developmental delay.






AEDs: Lamictal 225mg bid



Previous: OXC, PHT, VPA



Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Recording of seizures for

presurgical evaluation.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more

of the following reasons:


- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or

clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and

morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and

determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left


untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual

mortality rate.


- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient

number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are

reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures

and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures

and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient


safety during seizures;

- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these

medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses

to document patients exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG

monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of

monitoring.  The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG


monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were

placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20


international electrode system.  Sphenoidal electrodes were not

used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be


below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex

reference, digitized, and stored.  Periods of interest were


subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed

in detail.




Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and

computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG

activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 24


hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A

neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.


The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a

registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and

testing.  During times when a technician was not available, EEG

recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and


nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.



Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were

reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and

detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external

hard drive media.

suddenly waves her right hand in front of

her then slaps it and intermmitently yells

her right around followed by a slight turn if head to the right.

She then commences picking at her clothes with the left hand. She


continues picking at her clothes now with both hand and has mouth

lip smaking movements. She is tested verbally and does not follow


commands. She then appears to nod to questions but does not

follow commands correctly. She looks around and wrings her hands.

bifrontally. It continues to evolve with increased amplitude and

slowing in frequency as is spreads to the left hemisphere.



HR goes from 72 to 120 bpm during the seizure.

starts moving her legs in a rocking motion


intermittently while staring. When tested she cannot follows

verbal or motor commands.

slowing in frequency as is spreads to the left hemisphere. Then

diffuse muscle artifact is seen.

(Clinical seizure appears before EEG) While in bed exhibits some

picking movements with the left hand.

The appears to stare for seconds. Suddenly lifts up her right


hand and it appears to jerk slightly. She then slowly moves her

head to the right her left arm appears to become stiff and she

-----------------------------------------------------------------


INDUCTION PROCEDURES:

1. Sleep deprivation


2. Exercise



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:

Interictal Findings:

1. Frequent left anterior temporal sharp waves

2. Occasional right anterior temporal sharp waves


3. Left anterior temporal focal slow and TIRDA



Ictal Findings:

The patient had 5 seizures while hooked up to continuous

video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy monitoring unit.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. CPS and 2nd T-C



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Localization related epilepsy arising from the temporal lobe



CONCLUSION:

The patientas admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit


for 8 days with continuous video EEG.



The frequent focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region

may indicate a focal structural lesion in that region.



The interictal EEG is characterized by very frequent left


anterior temporal sharp waves and occasional right anterior

temporal sharp waves. This is


indicative of a potential epileptogenic focus in these regions.



We captured 5 seizures with right anterior temporal electrical

onset. However the clinical onset


Appeared to precede the electrical one.


The patient was weaned off lamictal over the course of her

Admission. She was restarted on her medication on the day prior


to her

discharge from the hospital.


No other medication changes were made during the hospitalization.


After this data is acquired she will be presented at surgical

conference to discuss the possibility of intracranial monitoring


/electrocorticography as a next step in her surgical evaluation.



Patient is follow-up with Dr at the Temple Epilepsy

Center as

an outpatient.



I have personally reviewed and interpreted this study, and this

report represents my findings and conclusions.
