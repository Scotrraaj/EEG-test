DATE OF STUDY: 05/01/16- 05/04/2016

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: EMU





HISTORY:

a 38 y.o. female with a history of severe epilepsy, progressive developmental
delay, persistent neurological decline in adulthood, hand washing activity referred for routine EEG
for management of seizure exacerbation and assessment of mental status change.  Mother had not
been able to givethe medication as advised.  Patient has had multiple emergency room admissions
for exacerbation of seizures and then alteration in mental status.  Somnolent after receiving seizure
medications





MEDICATIONS: VPA (level 85), Tegretol (level 14.1), Onfi




TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with
T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and
included a single channel of EKG and tactile/verbal stimulation.




_______________________________________

DAY 1 (May 2, 2016 - 5/03/2016, 06:00)





BACKGROUND:

The waking background is  markedly abnormal. The background is continuous and symmetric but not
clearly reactive, and consists of disorganized delta with occasional admixed faster frequencies.  As
the day continues, there is an increase in beta and theta.



By mid day on the second, the patient was sometimes awake with a low-voltage theta pattern.

Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.



The background is  reactive, variable.


There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was characterized by spindles, low voltage and occasional vertex waves.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional (1/hour to <1min)

1. Occasional (>1/1hr, <1/min)  left fronto-temporal (F3>F7/C3 max) spike-and-wave and sharp-and-
wave discharges


2. Occasional (>1/1hr, <1/min) right fronto-temporal (F4>Fp2/F8 max) spike-and-wave and sharp-and-
wave discharges. Some have bifid morphology and R Centrotemporal spread


3. Occasional (>1/1hr, <1/min) left parieto-occipital (C3>P3/O1) sharp waves

4. Occasional (>1/1hr, <1/min)  diffuse epileptiform discharges .  Some of these are high amplitude
bilateral diffuse spike and slow wave discharges or sharp waves


EVENTS: None



EKG: A single lead captured


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:



The overall background is improving in comparison to the baseline recorded on May 1.  Epileptiform
activity is less prominent in this section of the study.


-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 2 (May 3, 2016, 06:00 - 5/04/2016, 06:00)

The patient is more awake during this period.




AEDs: Tegretol (level 14.1), Onfi



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

There is an awake pattern which can include a low-voltage, reasonably well-organized background.
There is no definitive alpha rhythm.  At other times, the awake background is a lower voltage delta
pattern


Sleep is relatively low voltage, featureless, and with scant vertex waves and spindles.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

At this point, epileptiform activity is seen almost exclusively during sleep.


1. infrequent left fronto-temporal  Or centrotemporal (F3>F7/C3 max) spike-and-wave and sharp-and-
wave discharges


2. infrequent right fronto-temporal (F4>Fp2/F8 max) spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave discharges.
Some have bifid morphology and R Centrotemporal spread

3. rare left parieto-occipital (C3>P3/O1) sharp waves


4. Occasional (>1/10s) diffuse epileptiform discharges .  Some of these are high amplitude bilateral
diffuse spike and slow wave discharges or sharp waves.

At times, the epileptiform activity is low voltage and discrete.



Epileptiform discharges with center temporal maximum and a transverse field are sometimes noted

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



EKG: A single lead captured HR 96 BPM

DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:



The overall background is improving in comparison to the baseline recorded on May 1.  Epileptiform
activity is less prominent and the patient is more awake





-----------------------------------------------------------------




DAY 3(May 4 8:41 AM - 5/04/2016, 13:34)



AEDs: Tegretol, ONFIF



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

This section captures almost exclusively wakefulness.  The patient no longer has epileptiform
discharges in wakefulness.  The overall pattern is low voltage, relatively featureless, lacking an alpha
rhythm.


SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There areno clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



EKG: A single lead captured HR 90 BPM





________________________________________

Impression:


This today and 5 hour continuous video EEG monitoring session was abnormal due to:

1. bihemispheric and complex epileptiform activity which improved during the course of the study but
was present during sleep.  Some discharges were high amplitude others more subtle.  Overall, the
epileptiform activity was much more restricted than on May 1, 2015.


2. markedly slow background in sleep


3. improvement from markedly slow pattern in wakefulness to lower voltage slow featureless pattern in
wakefulness



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of multifocal epileptiform discharges superimposed on severe
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


There were no clinical/electrographic events reported or detected during this study.
