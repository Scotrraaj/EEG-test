HISTORY:

38 y.o. female with a history of Lennox Gastaut Syndrome, referred for
routine EEG for management of seizure exacerbation and assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS: VPA (level 85), Tegretol (level 14.1), Onfi



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous and symmetric but not clearly reactive, and consists of disorganized
delta with occasional admixed faster frequencies.


There is no posterior dominant rhythm.

Sleep transients are not seen.



Spontaneous eyeblinks are observed.

There is severe generalized slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Abundant (>1/10s) left fronto-temporal (F3>F7/C3 max) spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave
discharges

2. Occasional (>1/1hr, <1/min) right fronto-temporal (F4>Fp2/F8 max) spike-and-wave and sharp-and-
wave discharges


3. Occasional (>1/1hr, <1/min) left parieto-occipital (C3>P3/O1) sharp waves

4. Abundant (>1/10s) diffuse sharp waves



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

Single EKG lead was recording suboptimally.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only 52-min EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing with disorganized background and lack of reactivity


2. Abundant (>1/10s) left fronto-temporal (F3>F7/C3 max) spike-and-wave and sharp-and-wave
discharges


3. Occasional (>1/1hr, <1/min) right fronto-temporal (F4>Fp2/F8 max) spike-and-wave and sharp-and-
wave discharges

4. Occasional (>1/1hr, <1/min) left parieto-occipital (C3>P3/O1) sharp waves


5. Abundant (>1/10s) diffuse sharp waves




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of multifocal epileptiform discharges superimposed on severe
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


There were no clinical/electrographic events reported or detected during this study.
