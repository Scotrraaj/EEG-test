SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation. However there was frequent
intermittent bi-occipital 5Hz artifact that occurred in wakefulness and likely related to a mild tremor
although none would be noted clearly on video.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a mixture of alpha and beta frequencies,
with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-
posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. Excess 5-7 Hz activity is seen in
wakefulness. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.





EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Excess theta in wakfulness

2. Excess beta


3. Bi-Occipital intermittent rhythmic, artifact likely tremor



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
