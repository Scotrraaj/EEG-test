DATE OF STUDY: 05/17/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 49 y.o. female with a history of  CPS and TC seizures referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


topiramate (TOPAMAX) 100 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 100 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.

calcium-vitamin D (CALCIUM 500 + D) 500 mg(1,250mg) -200 unit per tablet, Take 1 tablet by
mouth 2 times daily (with meals).


melatonin 3 mg Tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth at bedtime.


CARAFATE 100 mg/mL suspension,

polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) 17 gram/dose powder,

OLANZapine (ZYPREXA) 10 mg tablet,


doxycycline (VIBRAMYCIN) 100 mg capsule,

naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).

multivitamin capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.




CALCIUM CARBONATE (CALCIUM 500 PO), Take 600 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

pyridoxine (VITAMIN B-6) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth daily.


ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet, Take 325 mg by mouth daily (with breakfast).

benztropine (COGENTIN) 2 mg tablet, Take 2 mg by mouth daily.


olanzapine (ZYPREXA) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth nightly.

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 600 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically limited record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.  The patient refused some of the
EEG electrodes and was poorly cooperative




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is disorganized and includes generous, rhythmic diffuse beta, scant 7-8 Hz
L4 rhythm and shifting arrhythmic delta activity.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and an increase in beta were noted.



Sleep is not captured



Generalized slowing is present.

Shifting focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY none


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Produces an increase in slowing


Photic Stimulation: Does not significantly activate the record





EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. generalized background slowing and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral
function.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified
