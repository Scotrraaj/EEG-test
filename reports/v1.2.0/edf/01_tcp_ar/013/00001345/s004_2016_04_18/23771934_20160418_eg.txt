HISTORY:

47 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy,

seizure free for the last 3 years referred for routine EEG for


characterization of seizures.

multivitamin capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.  Generous beta activity is noted


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Prominent wicket activity is identified, left greater than right



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic

stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric


photic driving, which is a normal finding.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. REg


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.

This patient's previous EEGs are not available for comparison at


this time
