â€¨61YR OLD MALE WITH PMHX OF SEIZURES, PRESENTS FOR FOLLOW UP EEG. REPORTS LAST SZ ON 10/6 WITH LOC AND POSTICTAL CONFUSION. KEPPRA,DEPAKOTE

Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg electrodes,awake,drowsy, hyperventilation, photic


Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV,10Hz alpha rhythm,which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness,the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent,and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Rare polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation,and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake only. The rare focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal region may be normal for age.
