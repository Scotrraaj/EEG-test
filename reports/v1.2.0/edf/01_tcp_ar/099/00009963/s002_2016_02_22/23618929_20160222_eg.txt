HISTORY:

76 y.o. FEMALE R HANDED.THIS AM PT. WOKE

UP AND NOTICED HER SPEECH WAS DIFFERENT NIECE SAW PT. YESTERDAY


IN AFTERNOON AND SAID, SHE WAS FINE. PMHX. MULTIPLE MYELOM STAGE

3.



MEDICATIONS:

GABAPENTIN, OXYCODONE, PERCOCET, LISPRO



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

poorly organized symmetric mixture of alpha and theta


frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8 Hertz posterior

dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient

of frequency and amplitude is present but not well organized.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



Occasional polymorphic delta seen in the bilateral anterior

temporal region.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Occasional focal slowing seen independently in the anterior


temporal regions

2. Mild to moderate diffuse slow



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are indicative of focal and diffuse cerebral

dysfunction respectively and are non-specific with regards to

etiology.
