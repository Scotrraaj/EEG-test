HISTORY:

70 y.o. MANTRANSFERRED FROM OSH FOR CONCERN

FOR STATUS. HAD GTC SZ, RECEIVED A TOTAL OF 10 MG, VERSED 4MG


KEPPRA, DILANTIN, VECURONIUM, FENTANYL, ETOMIDATE AND PROPOFOL

FOR INTUBATION.



PMH: SZ POST TRAUMATIC, PSYCHOTIC DISORDER, AORTIC STENOSIS, LBBB


MEDICATIONS:


KEPRRA, VIMPAT


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2




electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was

characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity

with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies.



There is an asymmetry with an increased amplitude and faster


frequencies seen over the right hemisphere maximal in the

temporal region consistent with a breach rhythm.


Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right


midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during

drowsiness.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Continuous right hemisphere maximal in mid-temporal region

focal slowing and associated breach.


2. Moderate diffuse slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to

continuous focal slowing and breach in the right hemisphere

maximal in the mid-temporal region.  This finding is indicative


of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely

structural in origin. In addition there is diffuse background


slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are

etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral

dysfunction.
