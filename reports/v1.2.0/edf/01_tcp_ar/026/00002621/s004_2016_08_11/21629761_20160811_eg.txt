TECHNIQUE:

A one hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is low voltage, symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a
moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 12 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. There is prominent diffuse beta.




During drowsiness, there is slowing of the PDR followed by slow rolling eye movements, attenuation
and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There was generous beta.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
POSTs, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured. There is generous beta
noted in drowsiness.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None

Wicket is seen.





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: produces an increase in amplitude in the background.



Photic Stimulation: a driving response is seen although the patient was falling asleep during photic
stimulation.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. There is generous beta
noted in this record. This is also a low voltage pattern. These findings can be seen in normal adults.


This individual has 6 prior EEGs. Four were available for review. Three, 2010, 2008, 2007
demonstrated left temporal sharp waves.
