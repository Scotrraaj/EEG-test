DATE OF STUDY: 05/13/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 80 y.o. female with a history of a suspected stroke.



MEDICATIONS:

Ativan




SEDATION: ativan



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.





The background over the left consists of 8 Hz theta activity posteriorly, poor AP (anterior-to-posterior)
gradient and excess polymorphic theta and delta activity.


The background over the right consists of a mixture of continuous polymorphic theta<delta activity.



During periods of quiescence, background voltages decrease and theta activity becomes prominent,
mostly over the left.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

An irregular heart rate of ~100 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild diffuse slowing

2. Continuous moderate-to-severe focal right hemispheric slowing

3. Cardiac arrhythmia



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.


Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the right.

An irregular heart rate of ~100 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



No electrographic seizures are captured.
