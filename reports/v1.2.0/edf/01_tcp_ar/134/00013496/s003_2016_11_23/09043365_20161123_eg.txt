SEDATION: unknown



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.




The waking background over the left is characterized by the presence 8-9 Hz activity posteriorly,
subtle underriding delta activity and poor AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient.




The background over the right consists of unstable 6-7 Hz theta activity posteriorly, excess
polymorphic theta activity and slow prominent delta activity that is most pronounced over the
temporal region.  This delta activity becomes prominent during periods of arousals.



Sleep is characterized by increase in diffuse low amplitude theta activity and sleep spindles that are
more pronounced over the right.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 105-118 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep 1-hour routine EEG due to:


1. Mild to moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization

2. Continuous right hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the right temporal region.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Diffuse slowing and disorganization are indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically nonspecific.



Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the right.
