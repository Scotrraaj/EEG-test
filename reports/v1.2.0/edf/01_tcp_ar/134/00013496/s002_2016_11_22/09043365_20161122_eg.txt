HISTORY:

38 y.o. male with a history of R GBM s/p resection, radiation, chemo, and VPS
referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures (gaze deviation) and assessment of
mental status change.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 250 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

metroNIDAZOLE (FLAGYL) IVPB 500 mg


midazolam (VERSED) 50 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL infusion

propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion

white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application




phenytoin (DILANTIN) 150 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB

ceFEPIme (MAXIPIME) 2 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 500 mL IVPB



SEDATION: propofol recently discontinued


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous and consists of disorganized delta, alpha, and beta. There is no
reactivity to noxious stimulation, variability, or state change. The background is otherwise featureless,
with no posterior dominant rhythm or sleep transients.



Delta activity is higher in amplitude over the right temporal region.



There is severe generalized slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:





This is an abnormal coma study portable EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing and disorganization, with lack of reactivity/variability/state change


2. Higher amplitude delta activity over the right temporal region

3. Tachycardia



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which
may at least in part be associated with sedating medications.




Higher amplitude activity over the right temporal region may represent breach rhythm, which is
consistent with this patient's history of right sided craniotomy.



There was no epileptiform activity, nor any clinical or electrographic events captured during this 26-
minute study. However, if subclinical status epilepticus remains a concern, long term EEG monitoring
is more sensitive in the detection of subclinical seizures.
