HISTORY:

60 y.o. MAN WITH A HX OF CPS. PT HAS A

ASTROCYTOMA.



PT JUST FINSIHED RADIATION AND CHEMO FEB. 2016




MEDICATIONS:

PHENOBARBITAL / KEPPRA



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically




satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


characterized by diffuse low voltage delta activity with absence

of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.


Sleep is not captured



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left


anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during

drowsiness.


Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also


seen.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Continuous left anterior temporal focal slow  a

2. Moderate to severe diffuse slow


3. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to


continuous focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.

This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction

in this region, likely structural in origin. In addition there is

diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These


findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate

diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication

effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.


Please note that the left anterior temporal sharp wave seen in a


previous EEG on 04/29/2015 at Jeanes were not seen in this study.
