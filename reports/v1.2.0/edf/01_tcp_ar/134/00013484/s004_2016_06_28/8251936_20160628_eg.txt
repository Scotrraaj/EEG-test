DATE OF STUDY: 06/28/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only




HISTORY:

a 69 y.o. female with a history of COPD, HTN, GERD, and chronic paranoid
schizophrenia who was hypotensive, brought to outside hospital and transferred to TUH s/p code on
6/27 (9:44 pm to 10:16 pm), referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.




MEDICATIONS: DOPAMINE,EPINEPHRINE,NOREPINEPHRINE,VASOPRESSIN



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background consists of a burst suppression pattern.  Bursts consist of disorganized delta and theta
activity and last up to 20 seconds, and are admixed with periods of suppression up to 49 seconds.
There is no reactivity, variability, or state change to verbal or noxious stimulation.




There is severe generalized slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal coma study routine EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing, with burst suppression pattern and lack of reactivity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.




Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
