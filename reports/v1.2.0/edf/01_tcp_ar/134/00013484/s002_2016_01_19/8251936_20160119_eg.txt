HISTORY:

a 69 y.o. female who was transferred from an

outside hospital after being found down unresponsive without a


pulse nad a possible unwitnessed seizure, referred for routine

EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS: FENTANYL, VANCOMYCIN, HEPARIN, NOREPHEPHINE


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a


symmetric mixture of mostly theta frequencies, with a symmetric

and reactive 5-6 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The


normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude

is present but suboptimal.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and further

diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.


Moderate generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

A single sharply contoured theta wave over the right temporal

region, maximal at T2/F8.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. A single sharply contoured theta wave over the right temporal

region, maximal at T2/F8.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of moderate diffuse cerebral

dysfunction.

A single sharply contoured theta wave was seen over the right

temporal region and is of unclear significance.


If clinically indicated, a repeat routine EEG capturing sleep, or

a more prolonged study may be of benefit.
