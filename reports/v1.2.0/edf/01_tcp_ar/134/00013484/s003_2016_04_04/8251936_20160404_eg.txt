HISTORY:

69 y.o. WOMAN WITH 2 EPISODES OF ???

SEIZURE.  EYES BOBBING MUSCLES WERE STIFF, BODY TREMORING,


DROOLING. GIVEN ATIVAN GOT BETTER. PT HAS PSYCH ISSUES NOT

GETTING MEDS..



MEDICATIONS:

VANCOMYCIN, PANTOPRAZOLE, IPRATROPIUM.



SEDATION: Propofol


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


difficult record due to movement artifact and included a single




channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


very disorganized and consisted in wakefulness of high amplitude

delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to

posterior gradient of frequencies. There is intermixed alpha and

beta.



In drowsiness there is diffuse delta intermixed with diffuse


alpha and beta.


Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are intermittent arousals that consist of bifrontal

myogenic artifact with central sharply contoured alpha/beta. No


clear epileptiform activity is seen.

Clinically the patient appears to move her eyes during this


arousals and becomes slightly agitated.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate to severe generalized slow waves and disorganization.


2. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal obtunded only routine EEG due to moderate to


severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These

findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate

diffuse cerebral dysfunction. The episodes described above had no

clear epileptiform EEG correlate. Excessive beta activity could


be secondary to the medication effect.
