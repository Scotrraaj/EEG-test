SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and mildly abnormal

for an adult of this age.  It consists of  a mixture of alpha, ,


background 4 Hz theta activity and a moderate amount of bifrontal

beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior


gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and

reactive 7.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which

attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  There is intermittent

focality in the record with the bit more slowing noted on the


left.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained, but beta spindles are present



Mild generalized slowing is present.  Subtle focal slowing is

present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Photic Stimulation: Scant driving response was noted



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a mildly abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.


1. mild excess theta

2. mild disorganization


3.  Subtle focal features, relatively unremarkable in an adult of

this age


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


No epileptiform features were identified.

This is the second EEG for this adult without epileptiform


features.

This study is markedly improved compared to the first study which

demonstrated all marks of a metabolic encephalopathy including

triphasic waves and marked background slowing


This routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
