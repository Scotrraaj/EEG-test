HISTORY: 57 y.o. female with a history of aneurysm, adenocarcinoma referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.  Several weeks of bizarre behavior, abnormal routine EEG. Prior Status, ? PRES MEDICATIONS: atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 20 mg losartan (COZAAR) tablet 100 mg lactulose (CHRONULAC) solution 20 g glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 4,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A continuous video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and Stimulation. Seizure and spike detection software was uses   DAY 1 (10/32016 - 10/4/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The background is continuous, symmetric, and poorly organized, consisting of a mix of delta and theta with occasional alpha.   Posterior dominant rhythm was present. The background is reactive, variable. Sleep was fragmented  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Wicket, breach   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  This is a chaotic, poorly organized EEG with a markedly slow background.  There are intermittent bursts of sharp waves noted in the left temporal region maximum T1.  The bursts can be relatively prolonged and are often obscured by muscle and movement artifact.  These bursts are identified only in wakefulness.  Consistently, when the patient is stimulated, the EEG becomes better organized and the bursts disappear  In sleep, there is a breach rhythm, but there are also intermittent left temporal sharp waves noted with variable maximum in the temporal region EVENTS:  No electrographic seizures were noted.  The patient was frequently upset but was always consolable and always interactive EKG: A single lead captured irreg 84 BPM  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Prominent epileptiform activity from the left temporal region, in the context of breach rhythm Markedly slow background Metabolic features      ------------------------------\----------------------------------  DAY(10/4/2016, 06:00 - 10/5/2016, 06:00) BACKGROUND: this is basically a slow, theta pattern, slightly less disorganized than the first day.  Breach rhythm persists GENERALIZED SLOWING: a bit better  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Occasional wicket waves are noted during drowsiness over the temporal regions  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) sharp waves are noted in the left temporal region.  When the patient is resting quietly there are paroxysmal bursts of left temporal sharp waves, but the EEG pattern response and with auditory or tactile stimulation the EEG transitions rapidly to a theta pattern.  Testing is never impaired with the bursts of sharp waves   EVENTS: None  EKG: A single EKG lead captured 90 BPM  DAY 2 AND FINAL IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION abnormal due to:  Generalized background slowing Metabolic pattern Focal slowing left temporal region Prominent left temporal sharp waves  No seizures were recorded.
