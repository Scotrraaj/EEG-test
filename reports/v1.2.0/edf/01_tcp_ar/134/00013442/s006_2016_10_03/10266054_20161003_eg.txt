SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.




Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:



Almost periodic to quasi-periodic sharp waves seen at T3>>T5 >T4



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 76 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Very frequent to almost periodic sharp waves seen mainly in the left mid-temporal more than the
posterior temporal region


2. Occasional right mid-temporal sharp waves


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a very abnormal EEG due to very frequent epileptiform discharges in the left mid-temporal
more than the posterior temporal and right mid-temporal region which is indicative of a potentially
epileptogenic foci in those region. In addition there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
