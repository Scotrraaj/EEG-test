TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  unsatisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation. Unsatisfactory due to muscle
artifact, agitation, and headache.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). There are shifting asymmetries in the alpha.  The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of
frequency and amplitude is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Brief trains of Left temporal sharps and spikes, high amplitude, lasting 3-14 seconds.  Stimulation of
the patient produces an alerting response and stops the spiking.  Later in the record, continual facial
muscle artifact obscures much of the EEG.



ACTIVATION:




PHOTIC: Obscured by muscle artifact, however, there is a driving response identified, which is
normal.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal  routine EEG due to:


1. BIRDS- Trains of left temporal spikes

2. Focal slowing in the left temporal region

3. Mildly disorganized background



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

The overall background is markedly improved compared to previous studies this month.  No clinical
seizures were recorded.
