HISTORY:

66 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy

referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule,

QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth nightly.

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 100 mg capsule, Take 100 mg by mouth 2


times daily.

thiamine 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth daily.

LIPASE/PROTEASE/AMYLASE (PANCRELIPASE 5000 PO), Take  by mouth 3


times daily (with meals).

b complex vitamins capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.

ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C) 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth


daily.




levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2

times daily.




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:

A  44 minute 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded

using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and


utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory

record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic


stimulation.  The patient could not tolerate the entire hour.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is asymmetric, but  Reactive. The left is


well organized and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate

amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal


anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by

a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),

which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. The alpha is

better organized on the left




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.






Sleep - stage II sleep was not sustained




No generalized slowing is present.

Notable focal slowing seen in wakefulness and sleep: R temporal

maximum with  focal slowing is present. Arrhythmic delta,

disruption of faster frequency activity and some rhythmicRT4 3-4


Hz activity




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Right anterior temporal sharp waves




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation: seems to accentuate the focal slowing



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION: Abormal

1. R temporal focal slowing, continuous


2. R anterior temporal sharp waves.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This  EEG does support  the diagnosis of epilepsy.  Correlate

with imaging.
