HISTORY:

This is a 48 y.o. female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring
with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events: shaking and LOC



Semiology:

jerking sensation in her chest similar to a hiccup which happens once or twice and then she loses
consciousness. After she awakes, she has no confusion or drowsiness and is immediately normal.




Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:








- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION: None



DAY 1 (2/24/2017, 14:30 - 2/25/2017, 06:00)



BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and excess beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes.
REM sleep is captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



*Note that record is affected by T5/O1 artifact despite tech's best efforts.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.



EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 80s-100s


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake video EEG


Excess beta can be seen in the setting of a medication effect (i.e., benzodiazepines and/or
barbiturates).

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



EKG: A single lead captured 80-96 BPM


DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION and overall CONCLUSION: This patient's
Symptoms are well controlled at this time.  The EEG was NORMAL. There were NO epileptiform
discharges. No events were recorded.  Benzodiazepines were cautiously held, but no symptoms were
elicited by this change.






At this time, the patient herself states that as long as she takes her medicines regularly there are no
events. Alternative strategies may be considered if additional information is needed.


Consideration for a STAT 1 hour EEG after the next event might be elucidating.
