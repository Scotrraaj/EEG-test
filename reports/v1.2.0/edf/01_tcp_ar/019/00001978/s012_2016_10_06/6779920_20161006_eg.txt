HISTORY:

48 y.o. female with a history of lifelong  Seizures with  Semiology:


The pt's seizures are characterized by a jerking sensation in her chest similar to a hiccup which
happens once or twice and then she loses consciousness. After she awakes, she has no confusion or
drowsiness and is immediately normal.  referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10  Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. There is prominent EKG artifact



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured

No generalized slowing is present.


In drowsiness, subtle left temporal  focal slowing is present. There is also L temporal beta
accentuation.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: despite EKG artifact, there is a discrete Left temporal spike, max T3> F7
>T1, very focal but with clear aftergoing slow wave. There are rare low amplitude bifed spikes.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: produces an alerting response







Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an  abnormalroutine EEG:

1. Left temporal focal slowing and discrete spikes.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This routine EEdoes  support  the diagnosis of focal epilepsy.
