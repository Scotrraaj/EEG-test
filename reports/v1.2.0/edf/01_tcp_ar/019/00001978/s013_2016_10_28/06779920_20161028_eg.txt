SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel one hour electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic
stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by symmetric and reactive 20-30 uV 9-10 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Low amplitude
frontocentral 18-30 Hz activity was seen. Moderate amounts of low amplitude muscle artifact, EKG
artifact, and occasional electrode artifact were noted.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy one hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
