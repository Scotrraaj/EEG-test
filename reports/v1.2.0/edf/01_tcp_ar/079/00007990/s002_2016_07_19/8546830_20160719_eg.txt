SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8-8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slowing, then attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing with increase in theta frequencies, are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric K-complexes.
Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Borderline mild generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.







Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a borderline normal awake and asleep routine EEG on the basis of a borderline normal
posterior dominant rhythm frequency.   There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a borderline normal awake and asleep routine EEG on the basis of a borderline normal
posterior dominant rhythm frequency.  Differential diagnosis includes excess drowsiness vs a mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


This EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
