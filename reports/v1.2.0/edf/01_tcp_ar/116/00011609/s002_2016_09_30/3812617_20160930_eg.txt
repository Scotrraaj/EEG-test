SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse high
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.


Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the
recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.


At times this discharges are sharply contoured.



Sleep is not captured


Moderate generalized slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.







EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



1. Triphasic waves

2. Moderate diffuse slow waves and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  1hr EEG due to frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves
and moderate diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse
encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
