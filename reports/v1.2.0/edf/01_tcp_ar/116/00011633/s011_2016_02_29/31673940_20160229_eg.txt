HISTORY:

54 y.o. FEMALE WITH A HX OF SZ. . PT BEING WORKED

UP FOR ANOTHER EMU STAY FOR PRE - SURGICAL EVALUATION.LAST SZ



MEDICATIONS:

ZONISAMIDE, VIMPAT, XANAX, DEPAKOTE, KEPPRA, LAMICTAL, TOPAMAX



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also


seen. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.


Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present


throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left

anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during

drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness noted over the left and

right.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces focal slowing in the

left anterior temporal region



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Intermittent left anterior temporal focal slowing


2. Excessive theta in wakefulness

3. Excess beta


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of left anterior temporal

and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction respectively and are


non-specific with regards to etiology. No seizures were seen.

Lastly, excessive beta activity could be secondary to the

medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
