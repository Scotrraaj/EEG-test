History:	54 year old woman with a history of medically refactory seizures.
Medications:	VIMPAT, ZONISAMIDE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow 
There is subtle paucity of faster frequencies over the right anterior temporal - it becomes more 
apparent during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse 
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, right temporal, anterior, subtle
	No epileptiform discharges
	No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 27-minute awake and briefly drowsy EEG due to subtle mild right anterior 
temporal focal slowing that becomes more apparent during drowsiness.  This finding is indicative of
 focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.
