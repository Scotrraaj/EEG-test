START DATE OF STUDY: 04/20/2016 at 22:54 END DATE OF STUDY: 4/21/2016 at 11:57  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 55 y.o. male with a history of seizures, HTN, substance abuse including xanax, and psychiatric disorder referred for EEG for assessment of mental status change. Received Ativan 1 mg in ED and became obtunded.  As EEG leads were being connected patient woke up and admitted to taking extra xanax earlier that day.  MEDICATIONS: Ativan 1 mg  SEDATION: as above  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (4/20/2016, 22:54 - 4/21/2016, 11:57)  BACKGROUND: The record opens to diffuse muscle artifact, which becomes most prominent over the bitemporal regions within minutes. The technician notes the patient is visibly shivering at this time.  Over the next hour, the muscle artifact gradually resolves, revealing a background with fair organization, consisting of alpha and excess frontal beta, and fragments of a posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and further background slowing. Well formed sleep transients are not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 60s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Suboptimal organization  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Excess beta activity is consistent with this patient's documented history of benzodiazepine use.
