HISTORY:

62 y.o. male with a history of CHF, lung nodule, hepatitis C, stroke, with
sudden onset speech difficulty and right hemiparesis after left femoral endarterectomy, referred for
routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically suboptimal
record, with excessive muscle and 60 cycle artifact, and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is characterized by low voltage poorly organized 7-8 Hz activity over the posterior
head regions, better developed on the right. Continuous irregular delta and theta frequency slowing
are seen over the left hemisphere, maximum over central and temporal regions. A large amount of
muscle, 60 cycle, and occasional frontal eye movement artifact is noted, obscuring portions of the
underlying cerebral electrical activity.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm with intermittent PVCs is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep EEG due to:

1. Left hemispheric slowing and attenuation of posterior rhythmic activity.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a functional disturbance but only involving the left
hemisphere without any clinical or electrical seizures and with no paroxysmal epileptiform discharges
recorded.
