SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that is best seen
over the left hemisphere. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present over the left hemisphere.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the anterior right hemisphere (maximum at T2/T4
and also at P4) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



No generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):




None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Continuous focal slow waves at right hemisphere maximum at anterior temporal region.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the right
anterior temporal region. This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region,
likely structural in origin consistent with the known stroke.
