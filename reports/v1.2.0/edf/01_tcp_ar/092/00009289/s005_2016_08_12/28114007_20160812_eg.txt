HISTORY:

25 y.o. male with a history of localization related epilepsy 2/2 right
temporoparietal encephalomalacia referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

levetiracetam (KEPPRA XR) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily for 360 days.

levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily for 360 days.

HOURS
albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs
every 6 hours as needed for Wheezing.


aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth once daily



Hearing Aid Accessory Misc, by Misc.(Non-Drug; Combo Route) route.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric sleep spindles
and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

Abundant right temporal polymorphic slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Abundant (>1/10s) right anterior temporal (T2/F8>T4 max) spike/polyspikes, activated by sleep. At
times these occur in 1-Hz runs for 2-3 seconds at a time but never evolve



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:




There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

An irregular heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Abundant right temporal polymorphic slowing


2. Abundant (>1/10s) right anterior temporal (T2/F8>T4 max) spike/polyspikes, activated by sleep

3. Irregular heart rate



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of right anterior temporal epileptogenic potentials
superimposed on a right temporal cerebral dysfunction. This study is similar in spike burden to routine
EEGs performed 6/2013 and 10/2013. These findings were discussed with the ordering doctor.
