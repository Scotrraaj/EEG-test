HISTORY:

47 y.o. male with a history of nonepileptic

events referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal


events.


MEDICATIONS:

lungs.


amitriptyline (ELAVIL) 75 mg tablet, Take  by mouth nightly.

pentoxifylline (TRENTAL) 400 mg CR tablet, Take 400 mg by mouth 3

times daily (with meals).

Indications: Hypercholesterolemia


sertraline (ZOLOFT) 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth daily.




lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth

daily.


insulin detemir (LEVEMIR) 100 unit/mL injection, Inject  into the

skin nightly. Use sliding scale


aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.

esomeprazole (NEXIUM) 20 mg capsule, Take 20 mg by mouth every

morning (before breakfast).

metformin (GLUCOPHAGE) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 3


times daily.

cetirizine (ZYRTEC) 10 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.


clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth 2 times

daily as needed.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.





SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).


The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.


Occasional left temporal polymorphic slowing.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and accentuates focal slowing in


the left temporal region


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Occasional left temporal polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of left


temporal dysfunction.
