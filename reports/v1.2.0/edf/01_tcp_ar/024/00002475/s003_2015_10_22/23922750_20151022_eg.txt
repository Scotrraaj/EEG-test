CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old right-handed woman, status post


remote large left MCA infarct and/or aneurysm. History of

epilepsy, evaluate for epileptiform activity.



INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the

lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1

channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation


was deferred.  This is an awake and drowsy record.


DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha


rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.




An asymmetry is noted with higher amplitude activity in the left

hemisphere with sharply contoured or irregular mixed theta-delta


noted in brief bursts lasting 3-5 seconds in duration.

Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling of eye movements,


attenuation of the alpha rhythm, rhythmic wicket, which is

present bilaterally and then accentuation of left temporal

irregular focal slowing.  As the recording continues and the

patient arouses from sleep, the alpha rhythm returns earlier on


the right before the left and again arrhythmic delta activity

with sharply contoured slowing was noted in the left temporal


region.  Despite some overlay of muscle artifact, there does

appear to be rare left temporal sharp waves noted at T1.


Photic stimulation elicited scant driving, obscured by


significant muscle artifact.



Heart rate:  60 bpm.


IMPRESSION:  This is the second EEG for this individual and it

remains abnormal due:


1. Left-sided focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency

activity in the mid temporal region.


2. Sharply contoured slowing.

3. Rare left temporal sharp waves.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports the structural or


functional process on the left.  No epileptiform features were

seen on the right.  In comparison to a previous study,


epileptiform activity did not seem to be as prominent today.
