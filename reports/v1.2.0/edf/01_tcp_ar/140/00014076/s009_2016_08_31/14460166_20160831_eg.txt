HISTORY: 

a 45 y.o. female with a history of anoxic encephalopathy after likely opiate overdose referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.  

MEDICATIONS: 

Current Facility-Administered Medications: fentaNYL (SUBLIMAZE) 1 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg dextrose 5 % and sodium chloride 0.45 % infusion midazolam (VERSED) 50 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL infusion LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg Keppra 

SEDATION: see above  

TECHNIQUE: A continuous, digital video EEG 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.  DAY 1 (8/26/2016, 10:00 to 8/27 6:17 AM)  

BACKGROUND: Markedly abnormal and includes a low voltage, relatively suppressed pattern, with intermittent discontinuity. There appears to be low voltage theta activity noted in the background. Myoclonic jerks were noted which produces artifact in the EEG. There is also some polyspike activity noted. The discharges are relatively generalized, frontally predominant.  Midazolam drip was initiated during this record. With the drip, and time, the discharges are lower amplitude, a bit more blunted and a bit more polyphasic. As the recording continues, it is difficult to determine if the patient is still twitching, but in the early hours of the record, there is clear stimulus-induced myoclonus The background is generally suppressed. Versed was increased to 14 mg. However, the myoclonic discharges increased. The background became more suppressed and bursts of sharp waves or myoclonic spikes persist.  Stimulus induced myoclonus also worsened (see 8PM)  

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  See above: Continual generalized spiking, with polyspike, seen even when patient not twitching. There were several patterns including a higher amplitude bifrontal spike or polsypike and a lower amplitude brief run of sharp waves in the frontocentral regions.  

EVENTS: Spontaneous and stimulus induced myoclonus  

EKG: A single lead captured *HR 80 BPM  

DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: 

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Pattern compatible with severe anoxic encephalopathy with markedly suppressed and at times discontinuous pattern and myoclonic jerks, worsening despite therapy. These results were discussed with the clinical team at the time of recording.
