HISTORY:

45 y.o. female with a history of CHF, DM, HTN, and substance abuse who was
found down in cardiac arrest (unknown time down), referred for routine EEG for assessment of
myoclonic jerks.




MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA,  ATIVAN, FENTANYL DRIP, VECURONIUM



SEDATION: as above


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous and symmetric but does not react to noxious stimulation. The
background consists of a disorganized mixture of mainly alpha and theta with admixed delta.





There is no state change, reactivity, or variability.



There is severe generalized slowing.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY AND EVENTS:


There is continuous diffuse spike- and polyspike-and-wave activity that is associated with diffuse
myoclonic jerks of the body and twitching of the eyes. This electrographic activity persists after 10 mg
vecuronium is administered at 10:00 (clinical myoclonic jerks resolve after this).



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal coma study portable EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing, with background disorganization and lack of reactivity

2. Ongoing myoclonic status epilepticus



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of an ongoing diffuse epileptogenic process in the setting of a
severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Following this study the patient was connected for long term
monitoring. The neurology consult team was notified of these findings.
