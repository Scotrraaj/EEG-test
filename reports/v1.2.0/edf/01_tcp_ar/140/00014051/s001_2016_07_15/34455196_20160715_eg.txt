HISTORY:

69 y.o. male with a history of TBI, Left frontal injury. Patient states he is not
have seizures but is having headaches. NOW referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.
Patient did not share medical records with EEG technician.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


LYRICA 75 mg capsule,

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, TK 2 CS PO BID

OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 150 mg tablet, TK 1 T PO QD


amLODIPine (NORVASC) 5 mg tablet, TK 1 T PO QD


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



TECHNIQUE:






A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a reasonably symmetric mixture of theta,
alpha, and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR) with some theta noted in the Left occipital region as well. The normal anterior-to-posterior
gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. POSTS are present. In transition to
drowsiness there is earlier slowing on the left.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Very mild generalized slowing is present.

Intermittent, subtle, left focal slowing is present in drowsiness



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a mildly abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:



1. Mild excess theta

2. Shifting slowing, left greater than right, primarily of drowsiness



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are non specific. The focal features on the left may be correlated with imaging and
clinical history. No breach rhythm is noted.
