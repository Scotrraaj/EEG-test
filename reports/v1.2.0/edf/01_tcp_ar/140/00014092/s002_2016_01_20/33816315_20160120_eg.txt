History:	62 year old man with left temporal tumor and seizures, now presents with high fever 
	and recurrent episodes of tinnitus, concerning for seizures.
Medications:	DEPAKOTE, KEPPRA, TEMOZOLOMIDE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
During maximal arousal the posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude ~ 11 Hz alpha 
activity with expected AP gradient.  Diffuse excess beta activity is captured.  During drowsiness, 
brief bursts of diffuse delta activity and theta activity are captured.
Frequent polymorphic and rhythmic (TIRDA) delta activity is captured over left temporal region.  
Rare left midtemporal - posterior temporal very low amplitude sharp waves with aftergoing slow 
waves are captured (maximal over T3 and T5 leads).
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart 
rate of ~120-140 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
	Beta, excessive
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left temporal, moderate-to-severe
	TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), frequent, left temporal
	Sharp waves, rare, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy portable 21-minute EEG due to frequent focal left 
temporal slowing, often rhythmic, and rare left temporal epileptiform discharges. These findings 
indicate focal structural epileptogenic lesion.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the 
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
