DATE OF STUDY: 06/27/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 61 y.o. WOMAN R HANDED. PT WAS ADMITTED FOR ISCHEMIC STROKE
WITH THROMBOLYSISI PT IS ALSO APHASIA.PMHX. STROKE R SIDE,HTN.NO H/O SZ.



MEDICATIONS:


ASA




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



Rare polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

An irregular heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1.  Continuous left anterior temporal focal slowing


2.  Rare focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:







This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the left
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region,
likely structural in origin and consistent with the known stroke. In addition there is rare focal slowing
in the right anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.





Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
