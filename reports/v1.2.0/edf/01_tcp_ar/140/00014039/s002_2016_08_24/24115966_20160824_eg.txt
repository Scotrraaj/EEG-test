HISTORY:

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of rhythmic and reactive 9-11 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR) on the right and low voltage anteriorly predominant bilateral beta activity.
Continuous irregular low to medium amplitude 2-7 Hz activity is seen over the left hemisphere.
Moderate amounts of muscle and frontal eye movement artifact are seen.




Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 70 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake EEG due to:

1. Continuous left hemispheric slowing. This abnormality is consistent with the patient's known
diagnosis of left MCA stroke. No clinical or electrographic seizures and no pathologic paroxysmal
epileptiform discharges were recorded.
