HISTORY:

44 YR OLD MALE INDICATION STROKE R/O SZ, LARGE LEFT MCA,CVA,
NAUSEA,VOMITING THAT STATRTED AT 3.:00 AM ON 7-20-16 CURRENTLY CAN ONLY SAY
YES PTIS APHASICALONG WITH R SIDED WEAKNESS.



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra




SEDATION: none




TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:



Asymmetric. On the right the background is well organized with a PDR that at best reaches 8.5 Hz.
However, there is excessive theta present in wakefulness. On the left hemisphere there is continuous
polymorphic delta activity maximally seen at F7. There is associated loss of faster frequencies over
this hemisphere.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm is only seen over the right side.



Sleep is not seen




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



1. Continuous focal slowing present in left hemisphere maximal in the frontotemporal region with
associated loss of faster frequencies.


2. Excessive theta present in wakefulness



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing present in left
hemisphere maximal in the frontotemporal region with associated loss of faster frequencies, which is
indicative of a focal structural lesion involving cortex. This is consistent with patient's known left MCA
stroke. In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is non specific with
regard to etiology.
