HISTORY:

44 y.o. female with a history of HIV and SIRS with increasing confusion referred
for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 500 mg


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

TECHNIQUE:


A  Bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized somewhat slow with a low voltage 9-10 Hz alpha rhythm,
frontocentral beta activity.  There is an amplitude asymmetry with slightly higher amplitude activity
in the left hemisphere.  In wakefulness and drowsiness, sharply contoured slowing is noted in the left
hemisphere with a broad field of spread including T1, T3 and F7.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Leftfocal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

none



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Sharply contoured activity left hemisphere



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: not done



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized background slowing


2.  Sharply contoured slowing from the left hemisphere particularly left temporal region


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



The findings of generalized slowing is a nonspecific finding particularly in the context of sepsis and
HIV disease.  The focal findings may be correlated with imaging.  There were no epileptiform
features noted.
