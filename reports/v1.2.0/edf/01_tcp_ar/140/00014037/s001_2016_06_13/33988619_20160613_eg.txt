HISTORY:

61 y.o. MAN WITH RESPIRATORY FAILURE. POSSIBLE ? LUNG
TRANSPLANT.NO H/O SZ.





MEDICATIONS:

HEPARIN,SEROQUEL



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:





No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




Some background reactivity to stimulation is seen with muscle artifact and some slightly faster
frequencies (theta).



Normal sleep is not captured but at times some central 12-15 Hz discharges consistent with spindles.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Moderate to severe diffuse slow waves


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal obtunded and asleep routine EEG due to moderate to severe diffuse background
slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
