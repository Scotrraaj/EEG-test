HISTORY:

57 y.o. male with a history of acute stroke, transferred to ICU for worsening
mental status,  referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:

unknown



SEDATION: None reported



TECHNIQUE:

A bedsideICU  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by an intra hemispheric asymmetry characterized by 2
patterns
1. Left - PDR with alpha 9.7 as well as diffuse theta, underlying almost continuous mixed theta /
delta

2. Right - alpha at 11 Hz, small theta, intermittent delta



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is asymmetric, no sustained stage II captured. Vertex waves, spindles, POSTS seen.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Left temporal wickets noted in transition to STAGE II sleep


Few bursts sharply contoured slowing on the left.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 74 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Focal slowing on the left

2. Right - mild intermittent slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are suggestive of a structural lesion of the left. No stage II sustained sleep is captured.
If there is any question, consider additional prolonged study capturing more  stage II sleep.
