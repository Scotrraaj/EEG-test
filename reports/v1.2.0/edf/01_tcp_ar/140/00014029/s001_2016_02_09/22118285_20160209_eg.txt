HISTORY:

84 y.o. male with a history of dementia and

hypertension referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental


status change.


MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Heparin, s/p Haldol the night prior



SEDATION: as above



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically suboptimal record as the

patient is not stimulated from sleep so that the waking

background can be assessed. It included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The record consists only of sleep.



Sleep is characterized by rudimentary sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow

wave sleep was not captured.


Background slowing cannot be assessed as there is no wakefulness


during this recording.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

CLINICAL: patient has a body jerk in sleep


EEG: there is no cerebral correlate to this movement, only

movement artifact


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a limited but abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Mild disorganization of sleep transients



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of mild diffuse cerebral


dysfunction.

If clinically indicated, a repeat study capturing wakefulness


could be useful to further assess degree of cerebral dysfunction.

A body jerk captured during sleep had no EEG cerebral correlate


and is unlikely to represent a seizure.
