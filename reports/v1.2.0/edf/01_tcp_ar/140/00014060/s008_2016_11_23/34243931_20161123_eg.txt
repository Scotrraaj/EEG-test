SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.



There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.


During arousals the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta <<delta activity.  During
sleep, theta activity becomes more prominent and sleep spindles appear.  They are more prominent
over the left.




Frequent non-evolving T4 and C4 polymorphic sharply contoured fluctuating 3-5 Hz activity is seen
in runs of variable duration.  This activity appears during periods of quiescence.







EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No clear epileptiform discharges are present but activity over the right is frequently sharply contoured.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


EEG technologist observes eye deviation towards the right.  There is no appreciable change in the
background during that episode.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing

2. Focal right hemispheric slowing




CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.

Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the right.



An episode of gaze deviation to the right was not associated with a change in the background.



No electrographic seizures are captured.  Even though no clear epileptiform discharges are present,
there is a large amount of sharply contoured activity over the right due to a prior craniectomy.
