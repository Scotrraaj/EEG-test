HISTORY:

83 y.o. 83 WOMAN PRESENTS WITH H/O ACUTE ONSET OF WEAKNESS AND
FATIGUE. CTH SHOWED RT FRONTOTEMP ICH.



MEDICATIONS:


KEPPRA




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The limited waking background with stimulation is characterized by the presence of a poorly
symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present. There is excessive 5-7hz activity seen diffusely throughout the record.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



1. Continuous focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the right
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region,
likely structural in origin and consistent with the known hemorrhage.
