SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized  mixture of theta and
some alpha frequencies, with an 8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by vertex waves. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present occasionally throughout
the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.



Intermittent to frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Intermittent to frequent right anterior temporal focal slow waves

2. Triphasic Waves


3. Mild to moderate diffuse slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the right
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific. In addition there is occasional frontally-maximal triphasic waves and
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a mild to moderate diffuse
encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
