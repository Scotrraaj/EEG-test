HISTORY:

83 y.o. male with a history of mild dementia

and L PCA infarct referred for routine EEG for assessment of


mental status change. Head CT shows right parietooccipital edema.


MEDICATIONS: none listed



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha, beta, and theta


frequencies, with a posterior dominant rhythm of 7 Hz that is at

times seen better over the left. The normal anterior-to-posterior


gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.


Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS:


3/1/16 at 12:45

CLINICAL: Tech notes a body jerk. On camera, the patient is lying


in bed when he suddenly has a truncal jerk, extending his body.

EEG: No EEG changes from background, aside from movement

artifact, were seen



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. A posterior dominant rhythm that is not as well visualized at

times on the right


3. A body jerk noted by technician which has no EEG cerebral

correlate



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific indicators of the presence of

right occipital dysfunction and mild diffuse cerebral


dysfunction. The body jerk noted above had no EEG cerebral

correlate and is unlikely to represent seizure activity.
