HISTORY:

83 y.o. male with a history of mild dementia


and L PCA infarct referred for routine EEG for assessment of

mental status change. Head CT shows right parietooccipital edema.

PRES vs CVA.



MEDICATIONS: Norvasc, Lipitor, Carvedilol, recently treated with

IV BP medicines



SEDATION: None



Technical: Introduction: Continuous video EEG monitoring is

performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of placement

with one channel EKG.  Seizure and spike detection software was


utlilized.  No seizures were identified by the clinical team. The




EEG begins at  1 PM on 03/01/2016 and concludes at 9 AM.

BACKGROUND:

In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and

disorganized low voltage with scant alpha.  The primary frequency

in wakefulness this theta



Sleep is extra spill low-voltage slow pattern with some


superimposed subtle, low voltage focal delta in the right

posterior quadrant.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: None, this is a bedside ICU record for an


awake patient



SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



EKG: A single lead captured HR 60-72 BPM



Impression and Clinical Correlation:

No epileptiform features were identified.  The generalized

background slowing described above is compatible with a clinical

syndrome of PRES, or other diffuse disturbance of cerebral


function.  The intermittent, right posterior quadrant focal

slowing is congruent with the focal imaging findings
