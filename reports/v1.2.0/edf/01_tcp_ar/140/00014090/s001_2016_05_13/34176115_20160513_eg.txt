DATE OF STUDY: 05/13/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 41 y.o. female with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

RIFAMPIN, OXYCONTIN, CLARITHOMYCIN, KEPPRA, LEVOTHYROXINE, ESITALOPRAM,
OXYCODONE, ATIVAN, TOPIRAMATE, TRAZADONE




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKGand photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is aborted early due to patient's discomfort.  It
produces no effect.



EVENTS:

Patient has frequent brief head jerks as well as subtle continuous head jerks.  These are only
captured during wakefulness/ drowsiness but not during stage II sleep.  They are associated with EMG
artifact.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.




A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.



Fequent brief head jerks as well as subtle continuous head jerks are not seen during stage II sleep
and are associated with EMG artifact.



No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are captured.
