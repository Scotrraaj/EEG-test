HISTORY: 28 y.o. male with a history of cocaine, opiate, and benzodiazepine abuse who was found down with PEA arrest referred for EEG for assessment after a possible clinical seizure (eyes rolled back, shaking) and screening for subclinical seizures.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: midazolam (VERSED) 1 mg/mL infusion sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg chlorhexidine (PERIDEX) 0.12 % solution 15 mL hydrogen peroxide solution 3%  SEDATION: on versed gtt 6 mg/hr, being tapered down starting 8/5/2016 17:00  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (8/5/2016, 16:30 - 8/6/2016, 11:45)  BACKGROUND: The record opens to a background that is discontinuous, symmetric, and poorly organized, consisting of low amplitude theta admixed with periods of beta. The background is variable but not reactive. There is no posterior dominant rhythm; sleep transients are not seen.  Just after 17:00, spontaneous eyeblinks are noted.  As the day progresses, the background becomes increasingly continuous, then discontinuous again.  Severe generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS:  8/5/2016 at 22:52 (duration: ~14 min 31 sec) CLINICAL: patient is on vent, increasingly tachypneic. Appears to have respirations out of synch with ventilator. Nurse suctions him intermittently. Patient rocks trunk forward, synchronous with his respirations - still appears to breathe out of synch with ventilator. A nurse can be heard saying, "Don't bite the tube" at 23:03. patient appears increasingly uncomfortable/tachypneic. At time of heart rate abrupt decrease (23:03), patient stops moving. Nurse calls a code and begins chest compressions. A nurse says, "he looks like he's having a seizure" at 23:04 - patient appears uncomfortable due to respiratory discomfort. A nurse says, "he's biting down." Someone says, "He's probably seizing." EEG/EKG: First change is heart rate increases gradually from a baseline of 84 bpm. EEG shows diffuse intermittent lower amplitude muscle artifact; in between periods of muscle artifact it is suppressed.  HR increases to 130s without change in EEG activity. As patient becomes increasingly tachypneic, EEG is obscured by muscle artifact. HR increases to 150s.  At 23:03, HR abruptly decreases to 80s, then 40s. At this time muscle artifact resolves, revealing attenuated background. Nurse calls a code and chest compression artifact is seen. There is no underlying ictal cerebral correlate.   EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 90s-100s except as noted above.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing with background disorganization and lack of reactivity 2. Episode of tachypnea without associated seizure activity  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are consistent with a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may at least in part be due to a medication effect. The episode on 8/5 22:52 is not a seizure.
