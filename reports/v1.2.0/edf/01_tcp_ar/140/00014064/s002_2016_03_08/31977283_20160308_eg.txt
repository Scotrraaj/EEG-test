HISTORY:

48 y.o. man found down on a bus after a

suspected overdose. EMS gave narcan with minimal response.


Patient was intubated and had cardiac arrest in ambulance and in

ED. ROSC achieved after >12 of epi and defibrillation x3. Patient

referred for routine EEG for as an evaluation for electrocerebral


silence.


MEDICATIONS: EPINEPHRINE, DOPAMINE, NOREPINEPHRINE,


PHENYLEPHRINE, VASOPRESSIN, VANCOMYCIN, ZOSYN, AZITHROMYCIN,

HEPARIN



SEDATION: none


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the




International 10-20 system and utilized a NicOne system. This was

a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel


of EKG and EMG. The study was analyzed at a sensitivity of 2

microvolts per millimeter with electrodes at double distances


using an electrocerebral silence montage, in accordance with ACNS

guidelines. Technician tapped each electrode to ensure system

integrity. Core temperature was measured at 99 degrees F.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is suppressed, without discernable cerebral


rhythms. There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the

recording. There is diffuse EKG artifact, continuously present,

in all leads. There is no reactivity to noxious stimulation

(including clapping, ocular stimulation, calling the patient's


name, and applying stimulation to lower extremities). There is no

variability nor is there state change.



Profound generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured

during this study.



HEART RATE: A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG

lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal EEG, performed in accordance with ACNS


guidelines for electrocerebral silence, due to:

1. Profound cerebral dysfunction, with absence of cerebral


rhythms, and lack of reactivity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of profound cerebral


dysfunction.

Cerebral rhythms are not detected.
