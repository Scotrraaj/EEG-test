HISTORY:

48 y.o. male 48 YO MALE FOUND DOWN ON BUS

AFTER SUSPECTED OD. EMS GAVE NARCAN - MINIMAL RESPONSE. PT


INTUBATED, AND HAD CARDIAC ARREST IN AMBULANCE AND ED. ROSC

ACHIEVED AFTER > 12 OF EPI AND DEFIB X3.  UDS WAS NEGATIVE



MEDICATIONS:

AZITHROMYCIN, HEPARIN, ZOSYN, VANCOMYCIN, TYLENOL



SEDATION: None reported


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record however


EKG and ventilator artifact were present and included a single




channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present.



Background activity was characterized by the absence of any

normal electrical activity or the expected anterior to posterior

gradient of frequencies.



There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the


recording.


There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no

change with visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli.



This EEG was not performed according to the guidelines of the


American Clinical Neurophysiology Society for the determination

of electrocerebral inactivity.


Sleep is not captured





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to:


1. Electrocerebral silence


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an isoelectric EEG but not performed according the ACNS


guidelines for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.

This EEG is consistent with, but not diagnostic of, cerebral


death. Please note that the ventilator and EKG artifact are

continuously present and interferes the definite

interpretation/declaration of electrocerebral silence.
