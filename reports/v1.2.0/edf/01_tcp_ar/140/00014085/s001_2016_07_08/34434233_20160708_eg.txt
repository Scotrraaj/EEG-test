HISTORY:

34 y.o. man p/w headache for 1 month was found to have left frontal brain mass.


Drain placed on left side near P3


MEDICATIONS:


Ofirmev, Insulin, Ancef, Keppra


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:






No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




Sleep is not captured


Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal at C3 with
associated loss of faster frequencies.


At times the slowing appears to become slightly rhythmic.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere maximal in the left central region

2. Moderate generalized slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere
maximal in the left central region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in
this region, likely structural in origin. In addition the is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
