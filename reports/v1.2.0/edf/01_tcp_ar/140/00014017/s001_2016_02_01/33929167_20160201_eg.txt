HISTORY:

17 y.o. Man R HANDED. PT STATES HE HAD SZ AS A

CHILD AND THE AT AGE OF 7 OR  8 THEY STOPPED. HIS STEP MOTHER IS


HERE TODAY AND SAYS HE HAD A WITNESSED SZ. ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

SYNCOPE? SZ. 53 CM HEAD

PMHX. N/A



MEDICATIONS:

None



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Bursts of frontal predominant spike and wave at 4hz with a slight

asymmetry and right predominance, at times in fragments.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1. Fast frontal predominant spike and wave with slight asymmetry.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal EEG awake and drowsy due to frontal

predominant spike and wave. This may be representative of a

generalized epilepsy however the asymmetry may reflect a focal


focus with rapid bilateral spread. Repeat EEG capturing sleep may

aid in elucidating the nature of this discharge.
