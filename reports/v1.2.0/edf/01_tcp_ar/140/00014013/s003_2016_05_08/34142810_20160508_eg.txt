HISTORY:

75 y.o. female with a history of  Pulmonary HTN referred for routine EEG for
assessment of mental status change, after new onset a Fib and acute drop of hemoglobin.  On
maximum ventilatory settings.




MEDICATIONS:

Epinephrine, norepinephrine, Primidone, vancomycin



SEDATION: propofol d/c at 5 AM

TECHNIQUE:

A STAT Bediside portable  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded
using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile/verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is characterized by the presence of 4-6 Hz theta activity with bursts of 1-2 Hz delta,
and brief 0.75-1 sec attentuations. There are ocassional triphasic waves seen.


Generalized slowing is present.




Subtle left focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

There are sporadic sharp waves noted, independently at T3, F7 and T4.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY none

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile stimulation increases the theta noted in the background



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 132 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal ICU coma  EEG due to:


1. Generalized background slowing.

2. Triphasic waves.

3. Sporadic simple sharp waves from either hemisphere.

4. Somewhat slower background on the left.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with an underlying bihemispheric disturbance of
cerebral function.  The triphasic waves are hallmarks of metabolic encephalopathy. The sharp waves
are simple in morphology. They suggest a potential for seizures. The presence of reactivity and
variability are positive prognostic findings for this critically ill patient.
