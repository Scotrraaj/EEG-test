DATE OF STUDY: 05/18/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only





HISTORY:

 a 36 y.o. male with a history of drug overdose and anoxic brain injury, now with
episodes of foot tremors and facial twitching.




MEDICATIONS:


No AEDs and no sedation




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.



The background consists of a moderate amplitude polymorphic primarily 3-5 Hz diffuse activity.
Passive eye openings are noted - no appreciable change in the background is seen during these
events.



No normal sleep architecture is seen and no clear periods of quiescence are observed.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No clear epileptiform discharges are noted.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no clear reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious
stimuli.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

Several events of subtle right foot twitching are captured.  None are associated with an ictal
correlate.

No episodes of facial twitching are captured.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate diffuse slowing




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.


Several events of subtle right foot twitching are associated with an ictal correlate.




Prolonged EEG could be of benefit in this patient.



These findings were conveyed to the neurology consult team.
