HISTORY:

86 y.o. female with a history of dementia, now presents with acute delirium,
agitation.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is a large amount of diffuse EMG artifact throughout the recording.  Due to patient's altered
mental status, the EEG technologist is not able to eliminate the artifact despite many efforts.



When EMG artifact lessens, the background consisting of low amplitude diffuse polymorphic 5-7 Hz
theta activity becomes apparent.




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal technically limited (due to large amount of EMG artifact due to patient's
noncooperation) awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate diffuse slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.



Due to large amount of EMG artifact obscuring large portions of the recording, focal slowing,
epileptiform discharges and seizures could have been missed.
