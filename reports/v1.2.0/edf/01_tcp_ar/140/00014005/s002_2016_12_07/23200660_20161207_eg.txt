HISTORY: 25 y.o. female with a history of drug use, who is currently pregnant, had a seizure earlier today in the setting of flumazenil administration and hypoglycemia.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: ampicillin-sulbactam (UNASYN) 3 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB MB+ acetaminophen (TYLENOL) suppository 650 mg cyanocobalamin injection 1,000 mcg ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM ULTRA-FILTERED PLUS) injection 300 mcg dextrose 5 % and sodium chloride 0.9 % with KCl 20 mEq/L infusion sodium chloride 0.9 % 1,000 mL with folic acid 1 mg, MVI 10 mL, thiamine 100 mg infusion haloperidol lactate (HALDOL) injection 2 mg betamethasone acet-betamethasone sod phos (CELESTONE) injection 12 mg Lorazepam (ATIVAN) injection 0.5 mg dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg Propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion midazolam (VERSED) 50 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL infusion fentanyl (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection 50 mcg glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg dextrose 20 % 1,000 mL with thiamine 100 mg infusion   SEDATION: Propofol, versed, fentanyl  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (12/7/2016- 12/8/2016)  BACKGROUND: With simulation/ during periods of arousals, the background consists of a mixture of frequencies (polymorphic theta, delta, alpha and beta) without the posterior dominant rhythm or AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient.  During periods of quiescence, the background consists of low amplitude slow delta activity with overriding diffuse 12-14 Hz sleep-spindle-like waveforms.    PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured heart rate of ~ 120 bpm.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal ~13 hours long term video EEG due to: Moderate-to-severe diffuse background slowing.  This finding is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  In this patient, however, it is at least partially related to the medication effect (sedative medications that she is receiving).  No electrographic seizures are captured.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (12/8/2016-- 12/9/2016)   BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured regular heart rate   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  This is an abnormal 24-hour continuous EEG recording due to moderate diffuse slowing.  This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but, again, in this patient, at least partially related to the medication effect (sedating medications that she is receiving)  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:   This is an abnormal 2-day video EEG due to:  1. Moderate diffuse slowing that does not change much throughout the monitoring period  FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but, in this patient, at least partially related to the medication effect (sedating medications that she is receiving)
