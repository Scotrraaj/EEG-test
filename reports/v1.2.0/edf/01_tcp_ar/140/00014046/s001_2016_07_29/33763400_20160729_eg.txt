HISTORY:

51 y.o. female with a history of reported Rett's syndrome and epilepsy, referred
for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS: VPA, Keppra



SEDATION: received Ativan in ED



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record
due to periods of diffuse muscle artifact. The study included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of diffuse low voltage fast frequencies.
Occasionally, fragments of a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz are visible.  The normal anterior-to-
posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.






During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and further
background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


Mild-moderate generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild-moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of the presence of mild-moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.



Low voltage record may be a feature of chronic Rett's syndrome, but may also represent a normal
adult variant.
