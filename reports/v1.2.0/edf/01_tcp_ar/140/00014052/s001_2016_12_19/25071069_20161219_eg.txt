SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory
limited record due to almost continuous myogenic artifact and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a mixture of alpha and beta frequencies,
with a reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) seen best over the left. The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present over the left hemisphere.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal over the right
frontal F4 region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. There and associated increased
amplitude and faster frequencies over F4 consistent with a breach.  There is very frequent sharply
contoured activity over this region but not definitively epileptiform.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by sleep transients, with vertex waves, sleep spindles seen best over the left
hemisphere. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

See above.




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximal in the frontal region and associated
breach.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and limited asleep routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the
right hemisphere maximal in the frontal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral
dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin.
