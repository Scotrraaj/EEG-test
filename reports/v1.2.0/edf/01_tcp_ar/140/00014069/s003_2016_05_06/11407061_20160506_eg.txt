A  Bedside portable 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International

software was used.

DAY 1 (05/06/2016, - 5/7/2016, 10:00)



BACKGROUND:

The waking background is  continuous, somewhat asymmetric, poorly-organized, and consists
predominantly of theta with admixed irregular delta, and smaller quantities of alpha and beta.


Posterior dominant rhythm was rarely present, L>R, and better visualized later in the record. .


The background is reactive and variable.



There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was difficult to define, but on the morning of the 7th, the overall organization was improving,
there were clear EOMs, and the theta was more rhythmic.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

occasional sharp waves are noted in this sharply contoured background, more so in the left temporal
region, more remarkable on the 6th.




EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected


EKG: A single lead captured 127 BPM



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Although there is a sharply contoured background and there are sharp waves noted in the left
hemisphere, there were no seizures.  Overall, during the 24 hour section, the background is
improving and the patient seems more awake, as judged by EOMS and presence of posterior
dominant rhythm.


No seizures were identified.
