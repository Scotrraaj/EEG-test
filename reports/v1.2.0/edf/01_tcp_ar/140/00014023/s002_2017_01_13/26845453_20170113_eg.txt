HISTORY: 34 y.o. FEMALE PMHX SIG OF SURGERY 7 YRS AGO IN FRONTAL PART OF BRAIN.  NOW WITH SZ, LT FRONTAL LOBE MASS, ALTERED MENTAL STATUS  LT-23  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg insulin lispro (Humalog) injection 2-10 Units sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL acetaminophen (TYLENOL) suppository 650 mg morphine injection 2 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet Bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) EC tablet 10 mg magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) packet 17 g alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL dexamethasone (DECADRON) injection 10 mg levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion gentamicin PF 8 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.   DAY 1 (01/13/2017, 16:16 - 1/14/2017, 07:00AM)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Sleep was not captured.  Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left fronto-temporal region.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right fronto- temporal region.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured 60  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to frequent focal slowing in the left fronto-temporal region and intermittent focal slowing in the right fronto-temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. In addition there is moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
