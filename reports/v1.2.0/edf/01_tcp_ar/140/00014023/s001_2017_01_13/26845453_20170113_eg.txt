HISTORY:

34 y.o. female with a history of left frontal oligodendroglioma resection 7/2009, with
recurrent frontal mass, hydrocephalus, altered mental status, acute PCA infarct, and seizures, referred
for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of poorly organized 7-9 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). Low amplitude widespread 18-25 Hz activity is seen, most prominent over
central and temporal regions. A moderate amount of muscle artifact is seen. A large amount of
medium to high amplitude irregular left greater than right frontotemporal 1-3 Hz activity is noted.




During drowsiness, attenuation of muscle artifact and beta activity are seen along with diffuse left
greater than right hemispheric slowing are seen.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional (1/hour to <1min) sharp transients and sharply contoured slow waves are seen in the left
anterior temporal region at F7-T3.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Disorganization and diffuse background slowing.

2. Prominent left greater than right hemispheric slowing, maximum anteriorly.


3. Infrequent sharp transients in the left anterior temporal region.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are indicative of a prominent left greater than right hemispheric functional
disturbance with infrequent irritative features (sharp transients) in the left anterior temporal region.
