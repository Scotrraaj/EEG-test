HISTORY:

76 y.o. WOMAN PRESENTS WITH H/O NEW ONSET OF LEFT SIDED WEAKNESS
AND LT HAND TREMORS. PMHX SIG FOR RT HEMIPARESIS FROM OLD STROKE.



MEDICATIONS:


None AEDs


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactiveposterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at
best reaches 9 Hertz  The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left more than right anterior temporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

An irregular heart rate of 66 bpm was captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Intermittent focal slow waves seen in the left more than right anterior temporal regions.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the left more
than right anterior temporal regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction these
regions, which is etiologically non-specific but likely related to her known strokes. No seizures or
epileptiform activity was seen.
