HISTORY:

43 y.o. MALE WITH SEIZURE PER PT SECONDARY

TO TAKING WELLBUTRIN. UNABLE TO LOCATE CHART.  PER PT NEVER HAD


SEIZURE


MEDICATIONS:


DEPAKOTE, BENADRYL, TESSALON, PROMETHAZINE, INSULIN, PROTONIX,

ZOFRAN



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present.



Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage

delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to

posterior gradient of frequencies.



Frequent bursts of 100uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal maximal slow

waves occur throughout the recording, increasing in frequency


during drowsiness also known as FIRDA.


Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate diffuse slow and FIRDA



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of


moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

No seizures were seen.
