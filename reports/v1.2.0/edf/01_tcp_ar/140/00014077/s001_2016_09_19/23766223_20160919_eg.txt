SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a symmetric mixture of alpha and beta
frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. Excessive 5-7 hz activity is seen
in wakefulness. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the T3 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None





OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



1. intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region

2. Excess theta in wakefulness


3. Excess beta


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the left
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.



In addition there is mild diffuse background slowing.  This finding is an etiologically nonspecific
indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
