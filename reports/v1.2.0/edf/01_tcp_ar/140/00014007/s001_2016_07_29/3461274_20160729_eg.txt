HISTORY:

76 y.o. female with a history of altered mental status and left facial weakness
referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically difficult record due to periods of excess muscle artifect, and included a single channel of
EKG and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is continuous, symmetric but consists of poorly organized alpha with admixed excess
theta and delta. There is no definite posterior dominant rhythm. The background is probably
reactive, with quieter states consisting of attenuation of alpha activity.




There are no sleep transients captured.



Moderate generalized slowing is present.

Occasionally alpha activity is seen less clearly on right occipital region.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no change in the background activity to visual, auditory,
tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal, technically suboptimal, awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate generalized slowing.


2. Occasional subtle attenuation of alpha on the right.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:





These findings are etiologically non-specific indicators of right hemispheric dysfunction
superimposed on moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
