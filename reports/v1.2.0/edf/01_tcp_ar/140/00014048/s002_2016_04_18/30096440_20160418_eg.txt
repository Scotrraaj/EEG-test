HISTORY: 46 y.o. woman with a PMH of seizures and alcohol abuse, now presents after a prolonged generalized convulsion.  She is subsequently intubated.    MEDICATIONS: ATIVAN 4 MG  KEPPRA  ETOMIDATE  ROCURONIUM *Ativan while in the ED, versed on admission  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (4/17/2016, 21:57 - 4/18/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous and consists of mostly delta frequencies with superimposed alpha and excess of beta.  There is no posterior dominant rhythm. Sleep transients are not captured.  Definite wakefulness not captured yet.   PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Occasional right anterior temporal (F8/T2 max) sharp waves 2. Occasional left frontal (Fp1 max) sharp waves  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 120s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video ~8-hour EEG due to: 1. Severe diffuse slowing 2. Occasional independent left frontal and right anterior temporal epileptiform discharges.  Diffuse slowing is indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but, in this case, at least partially related to the medication effect.  There are two independent epileptogenic foci (left frontal and right anterior temporal regions).  No electrographic seizures are captured.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (4/18/2016, 06:00 - 4/18/2016, 15:37)  BACKGROUND: improvement in degree of generalized slowing. During periods of arousal, there is a fairly organized mixture of alpha, excess beta, and admixed excess theta/delta, with fragments of an irregular posterior dominant rhythm approaching 10 Hz. Wakefulness is maintained for only brief periods before the background slows to a sleep pattern. Well-formed sleep transients are not captured.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: mild generalized slowing  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 110s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION 1. Improvement in degree of background slowing to mild 2. Occasional independent left frontal and right anterior temporal epileptiform discharges as seen on day 1. 3. Tachycardia   These findings are consistent with mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, at least in part due to medication effect. As on day 1, there is evidence for two independent epileptogenic foci (left frontal and right anterior temporal regions). Tachycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Generalized slowing, which improves over course of recording to "mild" 2. Occasional right anterior temporal (F8/T2 max) sharp waves 3. Occasional left frontal (Fp1 max) sharp waves 4. Tachycardia   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction, improving to "mild" by day 2, at least in part due to medication effect. There is evidence for two independent epileptogenic foci (left frontal and right anterior temporal regions). There were no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study. Tachycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.
