DATE OF STUDY: 09/01/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 77 y.o. male with a history of abrupt MSE with agitation, visual hallucinations
and impaired memory referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

haloperidol lactate (HALDOL) injection 0.5 mg

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 10 mg


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 975 mg

aspirin EC EC tablet 325 mg

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 5 mg in dextrose 5 % 50 mL IVPB


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 30 mg

senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet

docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg


brimonidine (ALPHAGAN P) 0.1 % ophthalmic solution 1 drop

sodium chloride 0.9 % IV bolus



sodium chloride 0.9 % IV bolus






SEDATION: none


TECHNIQUE:

A bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
theta>alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7.5 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. There are rare bursts of temporal
slowing, L>R




Sleep is not captured


Mild generalized slowing is present.


For an adult of this age: No significant focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild background slowing for age



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are non-specific and can be due to a toxic, metabolic, nutritional or
neurodegenerative  (dementia ) process. There were no epileptiform features.
