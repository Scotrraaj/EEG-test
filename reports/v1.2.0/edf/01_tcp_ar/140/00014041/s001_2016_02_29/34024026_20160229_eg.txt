 HISTORY: 71 YO MALE PRESENTS TO ED WITH SZ. PT HAS PMH OF SZ FOLLOWING STROKE.  IN ED GOT 15 OF HALDOL AND 6 OF ATIVAN   PT HAS SEVERE DEMENTIA  PRIORS UNDER DIFFERENT MRN.  MEDICATIONS: ATIVAN, HALDOL, DILANTIN, KEPPRA  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due to frequent T4 electrode artifact and included a single channel of EKG.  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of diffuse low amplitude delta frequencies, with the absence of a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) or a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. There is an superimposed diffuse beta seen.  Sleep is not captured  Continuous polymorphic delta and attenuation is seen over the right hemisphere maximal in the anterior temporal region.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake routine EEG due to: 1. Continuous focal slowing and attenuation over the right hemisphere maximal in the anterior temporal region. 2. Moderate diffuse slowing  3. Excess beta   CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings indicate the presence of a focal structural lesion in that region. No clinical or electrographic seizures are present. This EEG is distinct to previous ones in that no right temporal sharp waves were seen. However, please note that there was some technical difficulty with the right temporal lobe electrode. Additionally, there is evidence of moderate diffuse background slowing.  This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
