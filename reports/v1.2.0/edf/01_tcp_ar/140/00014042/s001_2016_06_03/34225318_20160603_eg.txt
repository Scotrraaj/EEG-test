HISTORY:

25 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O FOUND DOWN TIME UNKNOWN, POSS
DRUG OVERDOSE FENTANYL ( KILLBILL )



MEDICATIONS:


No AEDs




SEDATION: Propofol


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:





No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.


Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 10-25Hz activity is also seen.



Sleep is characterized by sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, and sleep
spindles.. Slow wave sleep was not captured.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Generalized slow waves, moderate with superimposed alpha

2. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
