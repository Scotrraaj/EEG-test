HISTORY:

25 y.o. man admitted on 6/3 after being found down unresponsive in his car
breathing spontaneously, narcan was given with out improvement. There was a drug found next to
the pt labeled "Kill Bill" along with a woment who was pronounced dead.




MEDICATIONS:

ativan, keppra, insulin



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:





No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




Very frequent diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.


Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 126 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Moderate to severe diffuse background slowing


2. Excess beta


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
