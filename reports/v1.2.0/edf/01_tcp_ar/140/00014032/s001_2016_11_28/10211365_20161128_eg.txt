HISTORY:

45 y.o.WOMAN WITH CC OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE,
PRESENTS WITH SEIZURE.

SEDATION: none



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Excessive 5-7Hz
activity is seen in wakefulness.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Occasional left more than right sharply contoured discharges in drowsiness most consistent with
benign epileptiform transients of sleep (BETS).



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.








EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. BETS

2. Mild diffuse slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing.  This
finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


BETS are a benign variant of unclear significance.
