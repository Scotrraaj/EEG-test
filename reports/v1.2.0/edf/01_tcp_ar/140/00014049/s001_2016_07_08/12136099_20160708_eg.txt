SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background symmetric and reactive.



is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta
frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




This patient appears to be very drowsy transitioning quickly into stage 1 or 2 sleep. During drowsiness,
slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and
diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured. POSTS are vigorous and
present.


Mild generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare (<1hour) There is a single Left temporal sharp wave noted.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Photic Stimulation: was performed while patient was in stage 2 sleep and did have a driving
response at 5 Hertz


EVENTS:

The patient had a headache at 3pm, EEG at this time was characterized by a normal awake pattern.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Mild background slowing and disorganization




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

The mild background slowing described above may be due to patients medication or other process.
Because only a single sharp wave was noted, this must be disregarded. If patient's nocturnal events
require additional assessment, consider 24hr inpatient or outpatient recording.
