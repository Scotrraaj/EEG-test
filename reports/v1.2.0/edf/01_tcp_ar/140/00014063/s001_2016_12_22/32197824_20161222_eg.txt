HISTORY: 67 y.o. male with a history of recent intubation, slow to return to baseline, referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: dextrose 5 % in water solution 1,000 mL labetalol (NORMODYNE) tablet 300 mg famotidine (PEPCID) tablet 20 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units insulin lispro (Humalog) injection 2-10 Units SEDATION: None BP (!) 159/90 (BP Location: Left arm, Patient Position: Lying)  Pulse 92  Temp 98.9 °F (37.2 °C) (Oral)  Resp 20  Ht 1.702 m (5' 7.01")  Wt (!) 148 kg (326 lb 4.5 oz)  SpO2 99%  BMI 51.09 kg/m2 TECHNIQUE: A bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.  EEG BACKGROUND: The background is characterized by a somewhat disorganized, mixed frequency pattern of theta and delta.  There is a glimpse of a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Occasional bursts of irregular generalized delta were noted.  Minor shifting asymmetries were seen Moderate generalized slowing is present.    No significant focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in alpha and theta frequency activity EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to: 1.  Generalized background slowing, with shifting asymmetries  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific in an adult of this age, in this particular clinical context.  This EEG can be seen in the context of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  No epileptiform features were identified.  There were no specific hallmarks of the specific type of encephalopathy
