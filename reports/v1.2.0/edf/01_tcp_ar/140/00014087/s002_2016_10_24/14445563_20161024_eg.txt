SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm is present.



The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen.


There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or
tactile stimuli.




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Intermittent generalized periodic discharges at 0.4- 0.6Hz

At times with associated muscle twitching seen on video consistent with myoclonus.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. GPD's with associated myoclonus

2. Severe background slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal coma  40 min routine EEG due to severe generalized slow waves and GPDs.
This is indicative of severe cortical dysfunction and irritability. In the setting of hypoxic injury this
pattern is indicative of a poor prognosis.
