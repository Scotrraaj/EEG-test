HISTORY:

22 y.o. FEMALE SZ SINCE 8 DAYS OLD, LAST GTC

WAS FEB 18TH, 2015.  BORN FULL TERM.


NO HX OF STROKE. WEAKER ON RIGHT SHUNT ON THE RIGHT SIDE, SKULL

DEFECT LEFT PARITAL / RIGHT FRONTAL

PRIOR EEG AT OSH ABNORMAL



MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA, LAMICTAL, OXYCARBAZEPINE



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present.



Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage

delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to

posterior gradient of frequencies.



Sleep is not captured



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the F4 region

during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. There is an

associated breach in that region.



Very frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F7/T3


region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.


During drowsiness there are intermittent burst of irregular delta

with some sharply contoured frontal discharges that are not


clearly epileptic.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


During drowsiness there are intermittent burst of irregular delta

with some sharply contoured frontal discharges that are not


clearly epileptic.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.






EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Continuous right frontal focal slow and associated breach


2. Very frequent left anterior temporal focal slow

3. Moderate diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to

continuous right frontal focal slow and associated breach. This


finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this

region. In addition there is very frequent polymorphic delta


activity present in the left anterior temporal region during

wakefulness. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral

dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. Lastly, the is

moderate diffuse background slowing. This finding is indicative


of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically

nonspecific.


The sharply contoured frontal discharge are not clearly epileptic

however to clarify this an EEG capturing sleep may be beneficial.
