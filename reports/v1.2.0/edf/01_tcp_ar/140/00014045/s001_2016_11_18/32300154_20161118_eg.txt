SEDATION: Fentanyl



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically suboptimal record
secondary to excessive muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is significantly degraded by excessive high amplitude muscle artifact,
obscuring much of the underlying cerebral electrical activity. Readable portions of the tracing
demonstrated predominantly irregular low to medium and medium amplitude 5-7 Hz activity seen
best over central and posterior scalp regions along with intermixed irregular medium amplitude
delta. The patient was noted to be grinding her teeth and tightening her facial muscles. 2 doses of
fentanyl 25 mg were administered with only slight facial muscle relaxation. The patient was noted to
be responding to questions, complaining of feeling cold. At 2:26:18 and 2:26:24, isolated focal spike
and slow wave discharges were seen in the right posterior temporo-parieto-occipital region. The
patient was then observed to make several gagging or grunting noises and a short while later, at
2:27:12, the EEG demonstrated rhythmic focal sharp and slow wave activity at 3-5 Hz in the same
right posterior quadrant















region, persisting for about 20 seconds and then slowing in frequency before subsiding at 2:27:12.
Several additional right posterior isolated spike-wave discharges were seen over the next 20-30
seconds, after which the EEG returned to previous baseline of muscle artifact and irregular delta and
theta frequency slowing. During the rhythmic discharge noted above, the patient appeared to be
lying quietly. After the discharge subsided, she made several additional gagging noises but was
responsive to questions or commands.





Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Several right posterior quadrant spike-wave discharges and rhythmic ictal-type activity detailed above.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There was a single 20 second electrographic event captured during this study as detailed above.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy one hour EEG due to:

1. Diffuse background slowing.


2. Several right posterior hemispheric spike-wave discharges.

3. A single 20 second ictal-type rhythmic sharp and slow discharge in the right posterior quadrant,
preceded and followed by gagging vocalization, although no obvious behavioral manifestation was
seen while the rhythmic sharp and slow activity was occurring.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate irritative activity and brief electrographic seizure in the right posterior
temporo-parieto-occipital region.
