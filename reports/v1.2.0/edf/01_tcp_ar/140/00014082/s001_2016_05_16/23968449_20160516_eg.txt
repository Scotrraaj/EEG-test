DATE OF STUDY: 05/16/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 28 y.o. WOMAN PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ ONSET CHILDHOOD. LAST SZ X 3-4
MONTHS AGO WITH LOC, SHAKING, TONGUE BITING, BLADDER INCONT AND POSTICTAL
CONFUSION.


MEDICATIONS:



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG HV, and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does have some
photic driving which is a normal response. However she had an event. See below.




EVENTS:

During photic stimulation with eyes closed the patient starts moving her head side to side followed by
hyperventilating. Next she exhibits irregular body trembling that starts and stops. She is questioned
by the technician and she does not follow verbal commands. The event lasts for 2 min. Right after
she stops shaking she is able to rapidly follow command and its oriented x 3.




EEG during the event reveals a normal awake background with no epileptifom activity.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:




This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG. The event described above had no EEG correlate
and it is most consistent with a psychogenic non-epileptic event.
