This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (09/20/2016, 10:03AM - 9/21/2016, 01:18PM)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse very low voltage delta with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Around 7:30PM the background increases in amplitude and a diffuse theta frequency discharge can be seen.  Intermittent diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.   There is also continuous attenuation of faster frequencies and focal slowing over the left frontal region.  Sleep was not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured   DAY 1 IMPRESSION  1. Improving diffuse slow wave and attenuation from severe to moderate 2. Intermittent triphasic waves 3. Continuous focal slowing and attenuation over the left frontal region  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to intermittent triphasic waves and moderate diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic vs hypoxic in origin.  In addition there is continuous focal slowing and attenuation over the left frontal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin.
