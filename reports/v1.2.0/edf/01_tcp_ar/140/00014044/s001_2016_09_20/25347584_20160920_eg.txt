DATE OF STUDY: 09/20/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:


EEG TYPE: 16 min 33 sec, coma study


HISTORY:

a 53 y.o. male with a history of CAD s/p DES, ESRD on HD, severe AS/MS, hepatic
dysfunction with ascites, DM2 who is s/p code (50 min CPR, 1 shock, ECMO started), currently
undergoing hypothermia protocol, referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.
Patient temperature is 34 degrees.




MEDICATIONS: REHVEIA, LOPRESSOR, VANCOMYCIN, ZOFRAN, HEPARIN, PROPOFOL,
ALBUMIN


SEDATION: as above



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background consists of diffuse, disorganized, suppressed delta activity. There is no variability or
state change; however there is no noxious stimulation during this exam.




The background is severely slow.


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal coma routine EEG due to:


1. Severe generalized slowing and background disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Contributing factors
include propofol and hypothermia. The patient was continued on long term EEG monitoring
following this study.
