25 y.o. female with a history of LVAD drive


line infection, now with continuous L arm twitching.  referred

for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.

Current facility-administered medications not reported by the

Technologist.




SEDATION: Ativan, Versed



TECHNIQUE:

A  Bedside portable video digital 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with

T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a


technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of

EKG but no HV nor photic stimulation.  The video captures the


left arm twitching.  The patient is intubated and poorly

responsive.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The  background is is partially of scattered by muscle artifact,

but the overall pattern is a low voltage, slow, featureless


pattern with delta>theta and slow intermittent eye movement.

Twitch artifact can be picked up in the initial sections of the


record.  Tactile and auditory stimuli do not seem to alert the

patient


Generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: See above


EVENTS:

Left arm twitching is observed on the video, but does not have an


EEG correlate



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is abnormal ICU STAT EEG.

1. replacement abnormal background with low voltage featureless


pattern.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is EEG supports a diffuse, bihemispheric disturbance of


cerebral function.  The use of benzodiazepines may play a role in

the pattern described above.  No epileptiform features were


identified.
