HISTORY: 25 y.o. female who was admitted for LVAD infection, s/p code on 3/17/16 with hypothermia protocol and ECMO, now undergoing rewarming and referred for EEG for as part of hypothermia protocol.  MEDICATIONS: include morphine, ASA, protonix, neurontin  SEDATION: None listed  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG   DAY 1 (3/18/2016, 18:48 - 3/19/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The record opens to a background that is continuous, symmetric, and poorly organized, consisting of delta and theta with admixed faster frequencies.  The background demonstrates state change, with more quiet state consisting of delta with attenuated faster frequencies.  There is no posterior dominant rhythm. Rarely, sharply contoured theta waves are seen phase reversing bilaterally synchronously over the central regions (C3, C4). These have an appearance consistent with vertex waves.  There is moderate to severe generalized slowing. Occasionally, there appears to be subtle attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 90s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and background disorganization 2. Occasional subtle attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere  These findings are consistent with moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere can be consistent with cortical injury over the right hemisphere, or with etiologies that increase the distance between the brain and recording electrodes, such as subdural hematoma or scalp hematoma.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (3/19/2016, 06:00 - 3/19/2016, 13:27)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 90s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change from day 1.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and background disorganization 2. Occasional subtle attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are consistent with moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere can be consistent with cortical injury over the right hemisphere, or with etiologies that increase the distance between the brain and recording electrodes, such as subdural hematoma or scalp hematoma.
