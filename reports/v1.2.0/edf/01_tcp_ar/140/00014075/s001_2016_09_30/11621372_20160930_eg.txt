HISTORY:

88 y.o. female p/w PEA arrest, 3 rounds of CPR 9/28/2016. EEG for neuro
evaluation


MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


fentaNYL (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection 50 mcg

amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg

dextrose 50% injection 25 mL


dextrose 50% injection 50 mL

glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 2-10 Units


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg


senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet




heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

midazolam (VERSED) 1 mg/mL injection 2 mg



SEDATION: None for 24hrs



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse
attenuation and  absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.


There is intermittent asymmetric low voltage delta activity seen in either hemisphere.




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no change in the background activity to visual, auditory,
tactile stimuli.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 76 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Severe diffuse attenuation and non reactivity.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal comatose EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
