HISTORY:

73 y.o. WOMAN WITH CC OF SYNCOPE EVENTS.  PMHX:
FORGETFULNESS VS DEMENTIA.  NOTE PT WITH BRAIDS AND DREAD LOCKS UNABLE TO
MEASURE


MEDICATIONS:


SYNTHROID, MEVACOR, COZAAR, HYROTEN, ASA


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a moderately organized symmetric
mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Excess 5-8 Hz activity is seen diffusely.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Excess theta in wakefulness



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing.  This
finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
