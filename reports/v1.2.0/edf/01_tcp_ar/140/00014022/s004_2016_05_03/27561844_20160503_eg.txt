HISTORY: 65 y.o. male with a history of right parieto-occipital CVA (LUE weakness) referred for EEG for management of seizure exacerbation and screening for subclinical seizures.  MEDICATIONS: Fosphenytoin load, then later Vimpat  SEDATION: s/p Ativan 2 mg, Versed 1 mg, Haldol 5 mg  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. seizure and spike detection software was utilized   DAY 1 (5/1/2016, 22:56 - 5/2/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric. The left hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of alpha and beta. The right hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of delta, theta, and more attenuated faster frequencies.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Continuous periodic 1-Hz right fronto-temporal (Fp2>F4/F8) spike-and-wave discharges with broad hemispheric field (lateralized periodic discharges also known as LPD+FR/PLEDs). Occasionally these nearly evolve at 2.5 Hz for <8 seconds.  EVENTS: Multiple electrographic seizures are captured: 5/2/2016 at 00:22, 00:36, 01:46, 01:54, 01:56, 02:04, 02:55, 03:03, 03:16, 03:30, 03:55, 04:05, 04:16, 04:26, 04:35, 04:41, 04:47, 04:58, 05:17, 05:37, 05:44 (duration: 4 sec up to 30 sec) CLINICAL: no clear clinical correlate. Patient intermittently agitated or lying still in his bed. EEG: aforementioned right fronto-temporal discharges develop increasing underlying rhythmicity, increase in frequency to 3.5-4 Hz, increase in amplitude and spread over right hemisphere, at times reflect over left hemisphere, and slow to 2.5-3 Hz  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 100s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Continuous right hemispheric slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies 2. Right fronto-temporal highly epileptogenic discharges 3. Right fronto-temporal electrographic seizures, ongoing.  These findings are diagnostic for focal epilepsy of right fronto-temporal origin, with ongoing electrographic seizures. There is additional evidence for right hemispheric cerebral and cortical dysfunction. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (May 2, 06:00 - 5/03/2016, 06:00) Clinical: The patient is awake but very confused.  He demonstrates a significant left hemiparesis, which his family states later on it is more remarkable than his baseline AEDs: phenytoin, Vimpat  TECHNIQUE: Seizure and spike detection software was utilized.  Electrode artifact is noted in substantial portions of the record on the morning of May 2. INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric. The left hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of alpha and beta. The right hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of delta, theta, and more attenuated faster frequencies.  Sleep: drowsiness is characterized by a dropout of faster frequency activity on the right before the left.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: 1. By noon, the EEG quality it has improved.  Even when the EEG is markedly limited, it is possible to see intermittent bursts of rhythmic sharply contoured slowing in the right hemisphere maximum in the temporal regions. 2. Intermittent right temporal periodic lateralized discharges are noted without definitive frequency evolution 3. despite the electrode artifacts, multiple electrographic seizures can be identified including 12:28 PM of 32 seconds duration.  The typical ictal pattern is similar to that described above with repetitive sharp waves spikes and frequency evolution, sometimes waxing and waning in a 30-60 second seizure See also: 16:56 PM, similar discharge out of sleep.  4. F8 discreet sharp waves 5. "BIRDS" of 5-8 seconds duration, right mid anterior temporal maximum. OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  SEIZURES/EVENTS: There are multiple clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  See above.  Examples: 12:28 PM, 16:56,  18:02- 22 seconds duration, without clear change in level of function.  Noted to breathe heavily during the discharge but answers questions appropriately as soon as the event is over. 18:53 28 seconds 19:12 20 seconds - NCS but no testing  21:13:48:00- NCS  EKG: A single lead captured 78 BPM, occ irreg Impression-Clinical Correlation: Over the course of this section of EEG monitoring, there are a few were sustained ictal discharges.  Seizures may be under recognize as the patient had difficulty keeping the EEG electrodes on. The EEG by the end of the 24-hour period is transitioning to more benign pattern with intermittent seizures and then infrequent seizures, right hemispheric focal slowing and occasional slow periodic discharges.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY  3 (May  3, 2016, 06:00 - 5/04/2016, 06:00) AEDs: phenytoin, Vimpat  TECHNIQUE: Seizure and spike detection software was utilized.  Electrode artifact is noted in substantial portions of the record on the morning of May 2.  AEDs: Vimpat, multiple modest phenobarbital infusions.   INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: The background is asymmetric.  The left hemisphere is slightly disorganized but there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz.  The right hemisphere demonstrated significant disruption of faster frequency activity  Sleep characterized by an increase in background slowing, rare vertex waves and right hemispheric periodic complexes.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: multiple electrographic seizures typically of 30 seconds duration were noted. The ictal pattern is unchanged with rhythmic sharply contoured slowing and or repetitive sharp waves in the right temporal region. Looking at the video, the patient seems to have motion arrest and does not seem to be able to use his left hand during the discharges. In comparison to the previous days of recording, the patient is now more awake alert, on camera and participating in self-care.  This, it is easier to see if he has an impairment Examples:  8:35 AM 12:04 PM 18:45 Motion arrest 21:47 OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: no SEIZURES/EVENTS: There are multiple clinical or electrographic events captured during this study. See above  EKG: A single lead captured HR 80 BPM DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: Seizures seemed to abate after the infusion of phenobarbital.  Focal slowing and some periodic complexes persist in sleep. Clinical correlate of seizures were relatively social to the team at the bedside.  Overall seizure duration was brief.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 4(May 4, 06:00 - 5/05/2016, 14 :15)  AEDs: Vimpat, Phenobarbital  INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: The  posterior dominant rhythm reaches 9 Hz on the left but the overall activity on the right remains somewhat slow with generalized theta and without a clearly defined alpha rhythm  Sleep is remarkable for prominent arrhythmic delta in the right hemisphere and slow periodic complexes without evolution Focal slowing is present Generalized slowing is resolving EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: 1. Broad R temporal PEDS in sleep 2. temporal sharp waves/sharply contoured slowing drowsy  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  SEIZURES/EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  EKG: A single lead captured HR regular, 80    -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is abnormal video EEG due to:  1. multiple electrographic and at times clinical seizures from the right temporal region, typically of 30 seconds duration.  Clinical characteristics included motion arrest, change and respiratory rate or inability to use left arm or inactivity of left hand. 2. Right hemisphere, particularly right temporal focal slow, improving by the end of the EEG monitoring session 3. R frontotemporal sharp waves or spikes  FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are congruent with a localization-related or complex partial status epilepticus with resolution of seizures following the infusion of phenobarbital.  The findings were discussed with patient and family and correlated with imaging.
