50 YEAR OLD WOMAN FOUND DOWN UNRESPONSIVE, MULTl ORGAN FAILURE, PEA UPON ARRIVAL TO RICU. PMH: DEPRESSION AND HTN CTH: 10/24 NO ACUTE ABNORMALITY
10/26 PENDING
INSULIN, HEPARIN, VANCOMYCIN, ZOSYN, FENTANYL, PROTONIX, VERSED SMG GIVEN 10/25@ 11:10PM, AND 10/26 1:40AM

Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes


Description:
	
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by an almost continuous diffuse delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. Intermittent diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording. These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. HR was 102


Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate to severe diffuse background slowing, absent alpha rhythm and intermittent triphasics. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology. However, the triphasics may be suggest that the findings may be due at least in part to a metabolic component. No
clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
