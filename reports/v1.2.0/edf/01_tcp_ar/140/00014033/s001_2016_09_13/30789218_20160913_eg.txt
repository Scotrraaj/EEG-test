DATE OF STUDY: 09/13/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 7 min study, awake only




HISTORY:

a 24 y.o. male with a history of episodes of LOC in 2007 x2 and head shaking,
referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

ALCOHOL PREP PADS Pads, Medicated,

CONTOUR NEXT EZ STRIPS Strip,


hydrOXYzine (VISTARIL) 25 mg capsule,

ketoconazole (NIZORAL) 2 % cream,

MICROLET LANCET Misc,


lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 5 mg tablet,

lovastatin (MEVACOR) 20 mg tablet,

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule,


predniSONE (DELTASONE) 5 mg tablet,

risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) 1 mg tablet,



warfarin (COUMADIN) 5 mg tablet,



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



Note that after 7 minutes, the patient became agitated and was unable to complete the study.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but
suboptimal.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:




These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


The patient was only able to tolerate 7 min of recording.

If clinically indicated, a repeat study capturing sleep could be obtained when the patient is calmer
for further information.
