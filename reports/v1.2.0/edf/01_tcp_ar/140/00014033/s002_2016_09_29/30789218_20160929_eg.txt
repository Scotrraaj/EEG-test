HISTORY:

24 y.o. male with a history of asthma and sarcoid with recent seizure referred for
routine EEG for characterization of seizures.


The patient was feeling unwell at the time of the EEG and the family was present during the
recording of the study


MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


ALCOHOL PREP PADS Pads, Medicated,

CONTOUR NEXT EZ STRIPS Strip,

hydrOXYzine (VISTARIL) 25 mg capsule,


ketoconazole (NIZORAL) 2 % cream,

MICROLET LANCET Misc,

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 5 mg tablet,


lovastatin (MEVACOR) 20 mg tablet,

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule,

predniSONE (DELTASONE) 5 mg tablet,




risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) 1 mg tablet,

warfarin (COUMADIN) 5 mg tablet,





TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is  Somewhat disorganized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta
frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  The overall background is
sharply contoured and there is excessive background theta




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  There are a few bursts of high
amplitude rhythmic frontal delta noted in the transition to sleep




Sleep is not sustained


Mild generalized slowing is present.


Intermittent shifting focal slowing is present in wakefulness.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Sharply contoured activity

FIRDA in transition to sleep



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) induces scant symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1.  Excess theta

2.  Some what disorganized pattern with shifting slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


There were no definitive epileptiform discharges in the sharply contoured record.  The background
slowing and disorganization may be correlated with imaging and clinical history.  If needed, a repeat
study may be obtained with the patient is feeling  better and sleep can be obtained
