HISTORY:

67 y.o. FEMALE WITH EPISODE OF SYNCOPE.

PMHX: MULTIPLE CHRONIC INFARCTS. RIGHT SUBARACHNOID ICA ANEURYSM


CLIP.  SKULL DEFECT WITH PLATE.


MEDICATIONS:


TOPIRAMATE, FIORCET, INSULIN, PROPRANOLOL, LOVENOX, PROTONIX,

LISINOPRIL,PLAVIX, PREDNISONE, LIPITOR.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due to


occasional movement artifacf and included a single channel of




EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



Frequent independent bilateral anterior temporal and mid-temporal


focal slowing


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Frequent independent bilateral anterior temporal and

mid-temporal focal slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of independent bilateral

anterior temporal and mid-temporal focal cerebral dysfunction,

which is non-specific with regards to etiology.
