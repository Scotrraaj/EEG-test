History:	43 year old man with a history of childhood seizures.  Patient had a stroke in 2014.  
	He now presents after a repored nocturnal convulsion.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the study
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse 
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
	No epileptiform discharges
	No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute awake-only EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide 
additional information.
