HISTORY:

39 y.o. female with a history of episodes of loss of consciousness.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


loratadine (CLARITIN) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily. Indications: Allergic Rhinitis

azaTHIOprine (IMURAN) 50 mg tablet,

levonorgestrel-ethinyl estradiol (AVIANE,ALESSE,LESSINA) 0.1-20 mg-mcg per tablet, Take 1 tablet
by mouth daily.


levocetirizine (XYZAL) 5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every evening.

fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray, 2 sprays by Each Nare route daily.


LIALDA 1.2 g EC tablet,


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.






SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During very drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Nearly continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the anterior temporal
regions, left>right.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and briefly drowsy  1 hour routine EEG due to:


1. Nearly continuous bilateral shifting moderate anterior temporal focal slowing, left >>right


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Focal slowing is suggestive of focal structural lesions over the bilateral anterior temporal regions.
