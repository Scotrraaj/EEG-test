HISTORY:

71 y.o.WITH SEIZURES.  PMHX: OCCIPITAL MENINGIOMA RESECTION, RIGHT
FRONTAL SHUNT HYDROCEPHALIS CVA, DEPRESSION.



MEDICATIONS:


KEPPRA


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
systemwith T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.


Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the T3 >> than T4 region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Rhythmic central theta or Ciganek rhythm



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



1. Independent bilateral (left much more than right) midtemporal focal slowing





CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
(left much more than right) midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
