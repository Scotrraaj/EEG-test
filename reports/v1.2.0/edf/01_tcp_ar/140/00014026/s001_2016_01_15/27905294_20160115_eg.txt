HISTORY:

56 y.o. male with a 1 year  history of

Epilepsy referred for routine EEG for characterization of


seizures. Fell, struck his head and incurred a concussion with a

result in seizure. He was hospitalized for one week at ARIA

Frankford division


Review of  radiologic study at the time of the head trauma. Reads

without displaced fracture




MEDICATIONS:

by mouth daily.

as needed for Anxiety.

thiamine 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

potassium chloride (KLOR-CON) 8 mEq tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY


MOUTH TWICE DAILY



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.






SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically challenging record and

included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.


This study is challenged either incorrect electrode placement or

craniotomy deformity in left frontal region



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.






Sleep is not sustained




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:




Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces minimal symmetric photic

driving, which is a normal finding.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.  However,

there may be a skull deformity in the left frontal region




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG. This routine EEG

does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

Correlation with imaging is suggested.
