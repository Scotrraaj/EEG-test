HISTORY:

50 y.o. Female p/w ? seizure. PMH significant for psychiatric hx, DM,
hypothyroidism



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

benztropine (COGENTIN) injection 1 mg

fluphenazine (PROLIXIN) solution 5 mg


glipizide (GLUCOTROL) tablet 5 mg

hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) tablet 25 mg

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


valproate (DEPACON) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



Excessive 4-7 Hz diffuse activity is seen in wakefulness. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-
25Hz activity is also seen.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Some stage I sleep is captured.


Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:



There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Mild diffuse slow waves

2. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing.  This
finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
