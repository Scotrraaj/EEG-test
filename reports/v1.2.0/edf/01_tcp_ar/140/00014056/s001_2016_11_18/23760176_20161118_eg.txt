HISTORY:

27 y.o. female with a history of asthma, anxiety, depression, panic attacks who
has had left-sided weakness, numbness and syncope, referred for routine EEG to evaluate for possible
seizure activity.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 2.5 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

[START ON 11/19/2016] LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg



Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

ALBUTEROL IN, Inhale  into the lungs.






SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by symmetric and reactive 10-11 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. A large amount of generalized low
voltage 20-30 Hz activity was seen along with occasional muscle, frontal eye blink, EKG, and 60
cycle artifact.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:






This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
