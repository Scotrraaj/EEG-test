DATE OF STUDY: 09/22/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient  8 West


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 63 y.o. male with a history of episode yesterday of apparently shaking that prompted
the resident to call RRT. Interrogation of the AICD by the heart failure team showed that it fired X 2 .
referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


heparin 25,000 units (100 units/mL) in 0.45% sodium chloride 250 mL infusion (Premix)

warfarin (COUMADIN) tablet 5 mg

polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) packet 17 g


pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg

furosemide (LASIX) 40 mg in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB

cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) tablet 5 mg


hydrALAZINE (APRESOLINE) split-tablet 5 mg

isosorbide mononitrate (IMDUR) 24 hr tablet 30 mg

abacavir (ZIAGEN) tablet 300 mg




atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 10 mg

carvedilol (COREG) tablet 12.5 mg


lamiVUDine (EPIVIR) tablet 150 mg

nevirapine (VIRAMUNE XR) 24 hr tablet 400 mg


oxyCODONE (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 10 mg

oxyCODONE (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 15 mg

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) suppository 10 mg


docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg

senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet


cyanocobalamin tablet 1,000 mcg

folic acid (FOLVITE) tablet 1 mg

thiamine tablet 250 mg

TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal  stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is very low voltage but characterized by the presence of a well organized
symmetric mixture of theta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. Scant
alpha and beta are seen




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,and
K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild, relatively symmetric and continuous generalized slowing is present.

A single burst of right focal slowing is present in drowsiness



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE: A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
This patient's multiple medical problems may play a role in this pattern.  The single burst of right
focal slowing is a nonspecific finding in a jolt of this agent may be correlated with imaging.  There
were no epileptiform features
