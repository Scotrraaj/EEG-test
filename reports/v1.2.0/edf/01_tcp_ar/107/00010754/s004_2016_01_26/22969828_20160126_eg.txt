HISTORY:

a 44 y.o. female with a history of TUBEROUS

SCLEROSIS, HTN, CKD, COPD, ANEMIA, DVT, C DIFF COLITIS, referred


for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change. Also

noted to be tremoring in the setting of a fever of 103.

Technician notes that patient squeezed hands and blinked to


stimulation.


MEDICATIONS: LORAZEPAM 2MG (8AM), MIDAZOLAM 2 MG,  HEPARIN,


HYDRALAZINE, METOPOROLOL, TYLENOL, PROTONIX, SPIRIVA, AMLODIPINE,

VANCOMYCIN, AZTREONAM, FAMOTIDINE.



SEDATION: as above


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded at the




bedside using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is continuous and symmetric but consists of

disorganized delta, theta, and alpha frequencies. When

stimulated, the background reacts and consists of disorganized


delta and theta but attenuated faster frequencies. At times delta

and theta appear sharply contoured in the posterior quadrants.


There is no posterior dominant rhythm.


Sleep transients are not captured.



Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

There are no unequivocal sharp waves or spikes. As mentioned

above, at times the delta and theta rhythms appear sharply


contoured in the posterior quadrants.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing with background


disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of moderate to severe

diffuse cerebral dysfunction, a similar finding to EEGs performed

during prior admissions.


If clinically indicated, a repeat study when the patient is out

of the ICU may be of value.
