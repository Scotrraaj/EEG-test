HISTORY: 45 y.o. FEMALE WITH PRIOR EEG NOW FOR LTM PMHX SIG FOR TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS, HTN, CKD, COPD, ANEMIA, DVT, C DIFF COLITIS, ADM WITH CHANGE IN MS.  EEG TO R/O SZ  MEDICATIONS: NO AEDs  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  There was an almost continuous eye fluttering artifact during wakefulness.   DAY 1 (02/10/2016 at 12:38PM - 2/21/2016, 06:42PM)  BACKGROUND: The waking background continuous and symmetric but consists of disorganized delta, theta, and alpha frequencies. When stimulated, the background reacts and consists of disorganized delta and theta but attenuated faster frequencies. There is no posterior dominant rhythm. The background is reactive and variable.  Sleep was limited but characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present.   PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured ~ 90 Bpm  DAY 1 IMPRESSION This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to: 1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing with background disorganization  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings indicate the presence of moderate  to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology. A similar finding to EEGs performed in the past. Please note that an almost continuous eye fluttering artifact was noted during the study.
