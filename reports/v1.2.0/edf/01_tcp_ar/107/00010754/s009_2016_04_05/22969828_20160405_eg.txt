HISTORY:

45 y.o. WOMAN WITH PRIOR EEG AND LTM  PMHX SIG

FOR  TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS, HTN, CKD, COPD, ANEMIA, DVT, C DIFF


COLITIS, ADM WITH CHANGE IN MS. NOW EVALUATE FOR BRAIN DEATH.


MEDICATIONS:


NOREPINEPHRINE, VASOPRESSIN, PHENYLEPHRINE, EPINEPHRINE,

DOPAMINE.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, and EMG




lead. This EEG was performed according to the guidelines of the

American Clinical Neurophysiology Society for the determination


of electrocerebral inactivity.





EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm is present.



The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not


seen.


There is mininimal electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the

recording. It consists of very low voltage diffuse theta activity


that appears to become lower amplitude with blood pressure

changes during the study.



There are very low voltage intermixed faster frequencies, It is

difficult to ascertain if this are artifactual.



There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no

change with visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1. Severe diffuse slowing and attenuatiom



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal EEG for the determination of electrocerebral

inactivity due to severe diffuse background slowing and

attenuation.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific

indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The


background variability appears to be related to blood pressure

changes rather than spontaneous variability on EEG. This is not


an isoelectric EEG performed according the the ACNS guidelines

for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.
