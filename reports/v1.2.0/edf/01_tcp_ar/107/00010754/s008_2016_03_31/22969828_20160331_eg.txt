Current facility-administered medications for this visit.

Meropenem, ethambutol , ciprofloxacin, isoniazid Pyridoxine,

others


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

auditory stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background in the patient's overall mental status are both

abnormal.  The patient either has eye blinking and appears awake


but is interactive or appears drowsy.  In both states, there is a

low voltage featureless pattern.  There is intermittent theta


activity noted in an otherwise delta background

Although there is variability in the record, stimulation of the

patient does not activate the record



Sleep is not captured



Significant generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not

performed.



EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal   routine EEG due to:


1. replacement of normal background with a slow delta featureless

pattern


2. unusual mental status in a patient with eye movement but slow

background and little interaction



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings support an underlying encephalopathy.  There may

be both acute and chronic features which contribute to this


pattern for this individual with a known neuro genetic disorder.

No epileptiform features were identified.  Previous EEGs are not


available at this time for comparison.
