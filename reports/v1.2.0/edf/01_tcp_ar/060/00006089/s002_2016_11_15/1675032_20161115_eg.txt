HISTORY:

83 y.o. female with a history of dementia, psychomotor slowing, syncope, and
possible seizures referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 5 mg

aspirin EC tablet 81 mg


valsartan (DIOVAN) tablet 80 mg

citalopram (CELEXA) tablet 10 mg

cyclopentolate (CYCLODRYL) 1 % ophthalmic solution 1 drop


docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg

furosemide (LASIX) tablet 20 mg

isosorbide mononitrate (IMDUR) 24 hr tablet 30 mg


loratadine (CLARITIN) tablet 10 mg

prednisoLONE acetate (PRED FORTE) 1 % ophthalmic suspension 1 drop



sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


dextrose 50% injection 25 mL

dextrose 50% injection 50 mL


glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 6.5-7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but
suboptimal.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured



Mild-moderate generalized slowing is present.

Occasional left temporal polymorphic slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild-moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Occasional left temporal polymorphic slowing

3. Bradycardia noted in this patient with history of syncope


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of the presence of left temporal dysfunction
superimposed on a mild-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Bradycardia is noted in a single EKG lead.
