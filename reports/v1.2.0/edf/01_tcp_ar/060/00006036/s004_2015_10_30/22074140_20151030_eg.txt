CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 47-year-old woman with epilepsy, previous stroke and Ml, patient was admitted to the Medical Service with pancreatitis. No current seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, morphine, Norvasc, metoprolol, and Creon.
INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode with 1 channel EKG. This EEG captures wakefulness and drowsiness. Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, this is an asymmetric EEG with a low voltage pattern on the left and a glimpse of a 10 Hz alpha rhythm. The right hemisphere demonstrates intermittent underlying focal slowing as well as more blunted posterior dominant rhythm. The overall background demonstrates generous beta bilaterally. The patient is noted to be jittery, but there is also intermittent theta in the right posterior quadrant. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and slow rolling eye movements.
Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was relatively drowsy and did not significantly activate the record.
Epileptiform activity: Intermittent sharp waves were noted in the right hemisphere of variable amplitudes and field, typically maximum at T4, T6 or P4. Some of them are a medium amplitude, others smaller and discrete. They may occur with a slight periodicity, but are not sustained.
Heart rate: 88 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due:
1.	Focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximum in the right poster quadrant.
Sharp waves noted in the right hemisphere with some variability, and ranging from the right mid temporal region to the posterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is characteristic of localization related epilepsy. No seizures were recorded. This EEG is similar to previous EEGs although no seizures were noted in this EEG.
