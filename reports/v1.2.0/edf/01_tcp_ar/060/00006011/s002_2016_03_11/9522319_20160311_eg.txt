HISTORY:

60 y.o. male who presents with change in mental

status.



MEDICATIONS:

NO AEDs



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The background consists of low amplitude 8 Hz polymorphic theta

activity.  The AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient is present.



Diffuse excessive polymorphic theta activity is captured.



There is large amount of anterior EMG, eye movement/ eye blinks

artifact.



Patient remains awake throughout the recording.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.





EVENTS:


Patient is jittery throughout the study


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~70 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


Diffuse slowing - mild

No epileptiform discharges

No stage II sleep

jitteriness


Artifact - EMG and eye movement/ eye blinks



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake-only 21-minute portable EEG due to mild


diffuse slowing.

This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction,


which is etiologically nonspecific.




Large amount of anterior EMG, eye movement/ eye blinks artifact

limits interpretation of the study over the bilateral anterior

quadrants.
