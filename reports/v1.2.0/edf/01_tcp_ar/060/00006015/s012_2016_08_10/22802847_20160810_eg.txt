HISTORY:

Patient is a 37 y.o. right handed male with developmental delay, h/o brain abscess and stroke
admitted to epilepsy monitoring unit for events characterization.


He has history of localization related epilepsy since 2005.



The mother is concerned of an new event when she had a conversation with him while she was
driving a car and after that he forgot the whole conversation, this happened in 04/2016. She was
unable to see if he had any automatism or twitching during this event because she was driving. She
has not noticed any other similar episodes. Patient is unable to describe any different feeling during
this episode.






Seizure semiology:




Type 1: Headache, sees pictures (likes scenes), he gets numbness on the left side. He stares. He could
shake and fall.


He had last event like that in 2/2016.




Type 2: Sudden staring and poor responsive for seconds (see above) .

Possible 1 per week.




Seizure risk factors: Normal birth, no pregnancy complications, he had developmental delay and
needed special education classes, finished high school. He has developmental malformation in brain
with agenesis of corpus callosum and colpocephaly, had brain abscess drainage in 01/2015 and left
temporal stroke. No major head trauma, no family history of seizures.





Current AEDs:

Levetiracetam 1000 mg BID




Prior AEDs: Phenytoin - changed to levetiracetam after his surgery in 2015.



EEG awake or drowsy routine (03/10/2016)


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. focal slowing from the left hemisphere noted in drowsiness and


intermittently in sleep.



CT HEAD WO CONTRAST 09/28/09


Impression:

1. No acute intracranial abnormalities.

2. Colpocephaly with dysmorphic appearance of the ventricular system


and midline developmental anomalies of callosal dysgenesis as

described above.

3. CSF attenuation right frontal parasagittal collection which may


represent an arachnoid vs epidermoid vs porencephalic cyst.

4. Rounded, soft tissue mass lesion in the suprasellar region as

described above, possibly causing patient's underlying visual


disturbances secondary mass-effect on the optic chiasm. This finding

may also be assessed on an MR examination.

6. Mild soft tissue fullness at the foramen magnum, suggesting


tonsillar ectopia possibly due to Chiari I malformation.





05/04/16


MRI brain with and without contrast

Impression: Further expected evolution of left-sided encephalomalacia


and presumed subacute to chronic infarct. Little change otherwise.



Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Characterization of seizures.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION: None



DAY 1 (08/08/2016, 11:11AM - 8/9/2016, 06:00)



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the occipital regions (right more than left) and
independently in the left mid-temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Intermittent focal slowing in the  occipital regions (right more than left) and independently in the left
mid-temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.

Summary:

Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the occipital regions (right more than left) and
independently in the left mid-temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.




Clinical Correlation

Intermittent focal slowing in the  occipital regions (right more than left) and independently in the left
mid-temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.




None of the starring events were captured, which suggest that these events may be behavioral but no
definitive conclusion can be stated because the events were not captured. No changes were made to
the AEDs.
