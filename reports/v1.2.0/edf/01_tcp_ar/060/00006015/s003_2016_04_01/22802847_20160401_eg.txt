HISTORY:

36 y.o.  MAN WITH CC OF SEIZURES.  PMHX: OF

SZS ONSET 2005. STOPPED 2008. RETURNED 2/15.  IN 2016 PT WITH


LEFT CVA / RUE WEAKNESS.   PMHX: MULTIPLE CONGENITAL DEVELOPE

BRAIN ABNORMALITIES.  PT HEAD 65 CM B/L SKULL DEFECT.  FOLLOW UP

1 HR EEG



MEDICATIONS:

levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1,000 mg by mouth 2


times daily.


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2




electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).


The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left


midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during

drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional

abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Intermittent left mid-temporal focal slow


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

There is intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal


region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral

dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
