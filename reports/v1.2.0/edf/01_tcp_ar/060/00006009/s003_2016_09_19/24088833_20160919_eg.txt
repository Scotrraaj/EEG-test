DATE OF STUDY: 09/19/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 32 yo female presents for follow up EEG. Pt has a history of TLE. No convulsions
recently. Pt will have auras when she worries.



Prior EEG showed L focus



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


oxcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 600 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

loratadine (CLARITIN) 10 mg tablet,

levonorgestrel (MIRENA) 20 mcg/24 hr (5 years) IUD, by Intrauterine route.


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. Touch base 1
month re: increase



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.






SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the F7/T3 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness. At times this is sharply contoured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Occasional focal slowing in the left frontotemporal region


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to occasional focal slowing in the left
frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.


No clear epileptiform activity was seen.
