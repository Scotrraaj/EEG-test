HISTORY:

42 year old man with epilepsy since he was an adult.



Seizure description:

Rising epigastric sensation with falls suddenly yell followed by


tonic clonic shaking for 1-2 minutes. Has had tongue bitting and

urinary incontinence. He is postictal for 1 hour currently they

occur once per year but this is not clear as the wife and patient


were

Giving conflicting and changing frequency.



ERF:  Had febrile seizures at age 1-3 year old. Has two sisters




with febrile seizures only.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Recording of seizures for

presurgical evaluation.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more

of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or


clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and

morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and


determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left

untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual

mortality rate.

- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient


number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are

reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures


and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus;

- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures

and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient

safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these

medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses


to document patientÂ’s exam  (9) there have been 13 reported

deaths during various video-EEG

monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of


monitoring.  The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG

monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were

placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20

international electrode system.  Sphenoidal electrodes were not


used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be

below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex


reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive.  Periods

of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of


interest and reviewed in detail.




Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and

computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG


activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 24

hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A

neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.

The patient was monitored by a registered nurse with special


training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a

technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and


computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure

testing and electrode maintenance.


Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were


reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and

detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external


hard drive media.


MEDICATIONS:

1. topiramate 00 mg tablet, BID


2. lamotrigine 200 mg tablet, BID stopped on day 1.



SEDATION: None


DAY 1 (02/08/2016 13:25 - 2/09/2016, 08:00)



BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized,


9Hz Posterior dominant rhythm

and consists predominantly of frontal beta with admixed alpha.


The background is reactive and variable.



Sleep was characterized by symmetric sleep spindles and/or


K-complexes.



Frequent polymorphic delta activity is seen frequently over the

bilateral midtemporal regions.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional bursts of 3.5- 4 Hz frontal predominant symmetric

spike and wave as well as polyspike and wave activity


Are seen lasting up to 3 seconds.



No clinical correlate is reported.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or


detected.


DAY 1 IMPRESSION

1. Generalized spike and wave- Fast


2. Focal slow waves bilateral midtemporal



DAY 2 (02/09/2016 8:00AM - 2/10/2016, 11:00AM)


Medication

1. Topiramate 75mg bid



BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized,

9Hz Posterior dominant rhythm

The background is reactive and variable.



Sleep was characterized by symmetric sleep spindles and/or

K-complexes.

No clinical correlate is reported.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or

DAY 2 IMPRESSION


1. Generalized spike and wave- Fast

2. Focal slow waves bilateral midtemporal



INDUCTION PROCEDURES:

1. None



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:

Interictal Findings:


Generalized spike and wave- Fast


Ictal Findings:

The patient had no clinical events while hooked up to continuous


video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy monitoring unit.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. None



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:


1.  Idiopathic generalized epilepsy



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 2 days

with continuous video EEG.  This was an uneventful EMU monitoring

Session because of no seizures were captured.



Focal slowing in the bilateral midtemporal region indicates a


focal cerebral dysfunction in that region, which is non specific

with regards to etiology. Frequent fast generalized spike and

wave are seen in idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Unfortunately

no seizures were captured to clarify if there was concomitant


focal or non-epileptic disease as may be suggested by history.

The patient wanted to leave due to family issues.



The patient was weaned off lamotrigine and topiramate over the

course of her admission. He was restarted on his/her medication

on


the day of discharge from the hospital. No other medication

changes were made during the hospitalization.



Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy

Center as

an outpatient.





I have personally reviewed and interpreted this study, and this

report represents my findings and conclusions.
