HISTORY:

42 YO MALE P/W MULTI SZ AT HOME. PT HAS HX OF SZ.

PRIOR EEG.



MEDICATIONS:

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2


times daily.

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 200 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH 2

TIMES DAILY.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present at T3 and T4

during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1.  Intermittent focal slow in the bilateral midtemporal region.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in

the bilateral midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of

focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
