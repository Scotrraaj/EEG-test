HISTORY:

42 y.o. male MP/W MULTI SZ AT HOME. PT HAS HX OF

SZ.



MEDICATIONS:

FOSPHENYTOIN



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due to

almost continuous movement artifact and included a single channel

of EKG and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present.


Background activity was characterized by diffuse mainly theta

activity with some delta and with absence of the expected


anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. Diffuse, frontally

predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.


Sleep is not captured



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the


bilateral mid-temporal region during wakefulness, increasing

during drowsiness. At

times some of the discharges are sharply contoured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Focal slow, independent bilateral mid-temporal (at times

sharply contoured)


2. Moderate Diffuse slow

3. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of intermittent focal

slowing in the bilateral midtemporal region.  This finding is


indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically

non-specific. In addition there is diffuse background slowing.

This finding is indicative of  moderate diffuse cerebral

dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. Excessive beta


activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as

benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
