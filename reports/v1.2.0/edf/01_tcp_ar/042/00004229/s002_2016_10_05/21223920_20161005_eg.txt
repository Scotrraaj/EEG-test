HISTORY:

29 y.o. female with a history of seizures since age 14, described as scream
followed by LOC and shaking, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) 200 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:








A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically suboptimal
record with excessive muscle and electrode artifact and included a single channel of EKG,
hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5-9 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Excessive muscles artifact obscures
portions of the underlying cerebral electrical activity. In addition, a large amount of eye blink artifact
and electrode artifact at O2 were seen.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 70 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.





A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
