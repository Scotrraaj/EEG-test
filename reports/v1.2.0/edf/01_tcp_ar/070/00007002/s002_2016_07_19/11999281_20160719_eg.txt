HISTORY:

67 y.o. male with a history of GSW to head 1995, presenting w/ episode of loss of
awareness and shaking 2 wks ago after drinking; had similar episode in 2010; referred for routine
EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.




MEDICATIONS: Keppra



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured



No generalized slowing is present.


Frequent left temporal polymorphic and quasi-rhythmic slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and
accentuates focal slowing in the left temporal region



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Frequent left temporal polymorphic and quasi-rhythmic slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of left temporal cerebral dysfunction, either structural or
physiologic.


If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.

Tech notes a prior EEG was done in 2010; results were not available via EMR at time of report
generation.
