HISTORY:

80 y.o. male with a history of DM

presenting with hypoglycemia and altered mental status, referred


for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.


MEDICATIONS: albuterol, aspirin, heparin



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The record opens to a symmetric but disorganized mixture of

theta, alpha, and delta.  There are no sleep transients.  With


verbal stimulation, the background reacts to include a fairly

organized mixture of alpha and theta, with a posterior dominant


rhythm approaching 7 Hz.


There is mild generalized slowing.

There is no focal slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of a mild diffuse cerebral

dysfunction
