HISTORY:

68 y.o. female with a history of MI x2, found unresponsive referred for routine EEG
for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

Facility-Administered Medications Ordered in Other Visits:


potassium chloride IVPB 20 mEq 100 mL

propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion

potassium chloride IVPB 20 mEq 100 mL


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 2.5 mg


amiodarone (CORDARONE) 150 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient was intubated and unresponsive during the study. Background consists of low amplitude
20-30 Hz activity, maximum over central and posterior scalp regions. A large amount of 30-40 uV
1.3-3 Hz activity is seen anteriorly, with large amounts of superimposed frontotemporal muscle and
occasional frontal eyeblink artifact.





With auditory or tactile stimulation, increased low voltage 10 Hz activity over central scalp regions
and increased muscle and eye movement artifact are noted.



No focal or lateralized slowing are present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep EEG due to:


1. Diffuse background slowing and disorganization.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:




These findings are nonspecific and indicate the presence of moderate bihemispheric cortical
dysfunction such as that seen with generalized encephalopathies of various etiologies. No clinical or
electrographic seizures and no paroxysmal epileptiform discharges were recorded.
