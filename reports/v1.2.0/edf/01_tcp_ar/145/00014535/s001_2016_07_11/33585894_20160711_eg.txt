HISTORY:

26 y.o. WOMAN FOUND DOWN AND UNRESPONSIVE BY ROOMATE



MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation. However at high sensitivity there
appears to be a C3 and 01 artifact as well as a 60 Hz artifact which are difficult to eliminated in an
ICU.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm is present.



The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen.



There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording.



There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or
tactile stimuli.



This EEG was not performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology
Society for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Isoelectric EEG


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an isoelectric EEG not performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the determination of
electrocerebral inactivity.  This EEG is consistent with, but not diagnostic of, cerebral death.
