HISTORY:

63 y.o. female with a history of head trauma, presenting with headaches and
seizures, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

phenytoin (DILANTIN EXTENDED) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth 3 times daily.

LORazepam (ATIVAN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours as needed for Anxiety.


neomycin-polymyxin-hydrocortisone (CORTISPORIN) 3.5-10,000-1 mg/mL-unit/mL-% Solution, 3
drops 3 times a day to right ear for 5 days.


butalbital-aspirin-caffeine (FIORINAL) 50-325-40 mg per capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth every 4
hours as needed for Pain for up to 10 days.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:





A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and an excess
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:




This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.


If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.

Excess beta activity can be seen in the setting of a medication effect (i.e., benzodiazepines,
barbiturates).
