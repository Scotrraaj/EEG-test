HISTORY:

49 y.o. female with a history of PEA code on 6/18 referred for routine EEG for
assessment of mental status change.


49 yo admitted on 06/18/16 with PEA s/p overdose, UDS + cocaine, PCP, Benzo, Oxycodone, last
seen normal 30 minutes prior, then found slumped in chair. ROSC after 4 rounds of epi, inubated,
cooling initiated, R frontal Crani defect.


MEDICATIONS:


Valproic acid, Famotidine, heparin, keppra, unasyn, albuterol


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically challenging record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:




The  background is characterized by a low voltage pattern with diffuse muscle artifact. There is more
frontal EOM on the left.


Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present. However, this is a limited EEG.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



No clear change with stimulation

EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 111 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal ICU  EEG due to:


1. Replacement of normal background with a low voltage featureless pattern.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This EEG is substantially obscured by muscle. If additional information is needed, a repeat study with
neuromuscular blockade is suggested.
