HISTORY:

51 y.o. WOMAN PRESENTS WITH H/O R/O SEEN AT

OSH WITH SHIVERING EPISODE.



MEDICATIONS:

Ativan



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and


amplitude is present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right

anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during


drowsiness.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Occasional wicket waves are noted during drowsiness over the

temporal regions


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Intermittent focal slowing in the right anterior temporal

region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and mainly in asleep routine EEG due to

intermittent focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region.

This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which

is etiologically non-specific.
