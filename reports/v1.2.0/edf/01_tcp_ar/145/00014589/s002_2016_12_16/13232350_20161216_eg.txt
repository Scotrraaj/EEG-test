HISTORY:

54 y.o. male with a history of  epilepsy, hepatitis C, emotional difficulties.
Seizures earlier this year with review is unremarkable EEG, referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.  His most recent seizure was in July and may have been associated with
claustrophobia




MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

SPIRIVA WITH HANDIHALER 18 mcg inhalation capsule,

nicotine (NICODERM CQ) 21 mg/24 hr,


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet,

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 300 mg capsule,

baclofen (LIORESAL) 10 mg tablet,


topiramate (TOPAMAX) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily for 360 days.

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

ALBUTEROL IN, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every 4 hours as needed.


fluticasone (FLOVENT HFA) 220 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every 12 hours.


METHADONE HCL (METHADONE PO), Take 50 mg by mouth daily.



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.  Patient seems very tense
and has a lot of muscle until he drops into stage II sleep



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  The overall background is low voltage with scant alpha
and prominent beta.  Prominent head rocking artifact was noted





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: produces an increase in amplitude of the background



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces scant
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This  awake and asleep 1 hour  EEG is within normal limits.  There are no clinical or electrographic
events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.  This is the second EEG
without epileptiform features for this adult
