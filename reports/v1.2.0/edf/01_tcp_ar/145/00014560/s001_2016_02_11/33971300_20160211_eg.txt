CLINICAL HISTORY: Pulmonary thrombosis.
MEDICATIONS: Etomidate, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, others.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous EEG monitoring was performed in the OR using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG and our standard operative montage. The 1st piece of recording was 8:26 a.m. to 8:36 a.m. and then 8:54 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. for a total time of 7:45 hours. Total one-on-one physician review time outside of OR 5 hours.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The first section of the EEG demonstrates an awake pattern with normal, symmetric reactive 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
In the 2nd piece of EEG, the patient is in the OR. There is background artifact. At 9:12 a m, the patient is receiving sedative hypnotic medications.
The patient was placed on bypass at 11:00 a.m. Cooling began at 11:03 a.m. with temperature of 16. Of note, early in cooling, the EEG demonstrates dramatic decrease in amplitude and is intermittently suppressed before target temperature is achieved. At 11:31 a.m., the EEG is very low voltage and nearly completely suppressed. Intermittent artifacts are noted between 11:15 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. The EEG is essentially suppressed at 12:03 p.m. with a temperature of 20.9 and intermittent bursts of delta seen approximately every 5 seconds, which are a likely noncerebral in origin. The patient achieved a temperature of 16 at 12:11 p.m. EEG appears to be suppressed at 12:15 p.m. and then there is a single slow burst of delta. From 12:15 p.m. to 12:21 p.m., there are infrequent bursts of delta of unclear significance and then following this, the EEG is more clearly suppressed, although there are intermittent artifacts noted in the background
Rewarming begins at 1:58. The EEG gradually resumed at 12:34 p.m. and intermittent pattern is noted. At 3:36 p.m., temperature reaches 32.9 and the EEG is continuous.
Heart rate: 60-90 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: EEG monitoring during hypothermia did produce a suppressed rate pattern with an initial marked suppression and then rare bursts of delta, followed by a transient but sustained suppressed pattern.
