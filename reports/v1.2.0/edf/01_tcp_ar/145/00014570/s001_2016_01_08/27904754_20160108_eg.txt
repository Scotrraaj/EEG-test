History:	59 year old woman with a recent nocturnal convulsion.
Medications:	no AEDs, metformin, Januvia, ASA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal 
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric 
Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region 
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional left anterior temporal (F7/T1 
maximal) sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces focal slowing 
in the left anterior temporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
	Sharp waves, occasional, left temporal, anterior, F7/T1 maximal
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior, mild-to-moderate
	Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 26-minute EEG due to intermittent mild-to-moderate left 
anterior temporal focal slowing and occasional left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges. 
These findings indicate a potentially epileptogenic focus in the left anterior temporal region.
