HISTORY:

31 y.o. female who presents with change in

mental status and abnormal arm movements, concerning for


seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


Ativan 2 mg x3 doses




SEDATION: ativan


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


There is frequent movement throughout the study.  Rare fragmented

7-8 Hz polymorphic theta activity is captured posteriorly.


Overall, the background consists of excess diffuse beta activity,

polymorphic theta activity and frequent diffuse

sleep-spindle-like waveforms.



Symmetrical vertex waves are noted.



Patient rapidly transitions between drowsiness and wakefulness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.





EVENTS:

Frequent brief (<10 seconds) events of non-stereotyped arm


movements are captured.  They are not associated with an abnormal

ictal correlate.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

Mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing


Excess beta

Events - many - no EEG correlated



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 25-minute portable EEG due

to mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing that indicates etiologically


nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction that at least partially

related to the medication effect.


Excess beta could be secondary to medications, such as


benzodiazepines or barbiturates.



Frequent brief (<10 seconds) events of non-stereotyped arm

movements are not associated with an abnormal ictal correlate.


These findings were conveyed to the neurology consult team.
