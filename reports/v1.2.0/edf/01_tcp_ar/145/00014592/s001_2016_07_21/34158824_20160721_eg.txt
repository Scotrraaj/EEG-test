HISTORY: 72 y.o. male with a history of long ICU hospitalization, s/p lung transplant May 2016, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.  MEDICATIONS: NSULIN, CLONIDINE, METOPROLOL, CELLCEPT, PROTONIX, LIPITOR, VALCYTE, PREDNISONE, MEROPENEM, METOPROLOL  SEDATION: Haldol fentanyl yesterday, had  No propofol since yesterday at PM  TECHNIQUE: A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation. L arm jerking was noted  EEG BACKGROUND: The background is characterized by the presence of a fairly symmetric mixture of theta, small amounts of delta and scant alpha or  beta frequencies, without  a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. Continuous eye movement was noted  A questionable Drowsy pattern was seen, with more delta and a more rhythmic background but persistent eye movements. Sleep is not otherwise well defined.  Generalized slowing is present.   Shifting slowing is present. Mostly frontal delta  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile and verbal stimuli do not clearly impact the patient nor the EEG  EVENTS: There are  clinical  events captured during this study. Isolated jerks of the face are characterized by muscle artifact only. Left arm jerking was noted, and is characterized by 3 seconds of muscle artifact only. Movement near the patients face produced grimacing  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal ICU routine EEG due to: 1. Generalized slowing 2. Paucity of the normal waveforms of wakefulness or sleep  CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are nonspecific and frequently found in association with toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. The Mental status was difficult for the tech to define at the bedside and is more suggestive of a chronic severe encephalopathy.  The motor features were not associated with epileptiform activity.
