DATE OF STUDY: 06/24/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 36 y.o. female with a history of seizures since , last occurred ~ when she
was in a car accident, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

aspirin EC 325 mg EC tablet,

DOC-Q-LACE 100 mg capsule,


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet,

SENNA LAX 8.6 mg tablet,



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.


Frequent right temporal polymorphic slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Occasional (1/hour to <1min) right anterior temporal (T2>F8/T4 max) sharp waves


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Frequent right temporal polymorphic slowing




2. Occasional  right anterior temporal (T2>F8/T4 max) sharp waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of right anterior temporal epileptogenic potentials
superimposed on right temporal cerebral dysfunction.




Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
