HISTORY:

58 y.o. male with a history of sleep apnea, hypertension, depression,
schizophrenia, referred for routine EEG for possible seizures during sleep.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 150 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 40 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

metformin (GLUCOPHAGE) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).

losartan (COZAAR) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

FLUoxetine (PROZAC) 20 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel 1 hour electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background consists of well developed symmetric and reactive 40-60 uV 8.5-9.5 Hertz
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Low amplitude
18-30 Hz activity is seen, maximum anteriorly. Prominent EKG artifact and a small amount of low
amplitude muscle artifact are seen.





During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
