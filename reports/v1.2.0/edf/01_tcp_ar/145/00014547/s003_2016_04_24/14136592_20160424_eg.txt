START DATE OF STUDY: 04/23/2016 at 11:45 END DATE OF STUDY: 04/24/2016 at 10:18  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 53 y.o. female with a history of R MCA infarct s/p thrombectomy (other PMH: CAD, HTN, HLD, COPD, anemia, mechanical valve on anticoagulation), referred for long term video EEG for assessment of mental status change. This study follows a routine portable EEG, reported separately.  MEDICATIONS: INSULIN, METOPROLOL, FAMOTIDINE, PLAVIX, LIPITOR, ACETAZOLAMIDE   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (4/23/2016, 11:45 - 4/24/2016, 10:18)  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7.5-8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is subtle attenuation of faster frequencies seen intermittently over the right hemisphere.  During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep is characterized by spindles that at times appear less well formed over the right hemisphere.  Mild generalized slowing is present.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.   EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate in the 90s is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and asleep long term video EEG due to: 1. Mild generalized slowing 2. Subtle attenuation of faster frequencies and sleep transients less well formed, both seen at times over the right hemisphere  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings indicate the presence of right hemispheric cortical and cerebral dysfunction superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
