DATE OF STUDY: 04/23/2016

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 53 y.o. female with a history of R MCA infarct

s/p thrombectomy (other PMH: CAD, HTN, HLD, COPD, anemia,


mechanical valve on anticoagulation), referred for routine EEG

for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS: INSULIN, METOPROLOL, FAMOTIDINE, PLAVIX, LIPITOR,

ACETAZOLAMIDE



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 7.5-8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm

(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.

There is subtle attenuation of faster frequencies seen


intermittently over the right hemisphere.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by spindles that at times appear less well

formed over the right hemisphere.



Mild generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing


2. Subtle attenuation of faster frequencies and sleep transients

less well formed, both seen at times over the right hemisphere



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of right hemispheric

cortical and cerebral dysfunction superimposed on mild diffuse


cerebral dysfunction.
