DATE OF STUDY: 06/29/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and asleep



HISTORY:

a 24 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy, severe encephalopathy, history of
hydrocephalus referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL XR) 100 mg 12 hr tablet, Take 3 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.

clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 0.5 mg disintegrating tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.


lidocaine (XYLOCAINE) 2 % Solution mucosal solution, Apply to area around tube every 3 hours as
needed for pain


clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 1 mg disintegrating tablet, 1 at the onset of a seizure

verapamil (CALAN-SR) 120 mg CR tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

acetaminophen-codeine (TYLENOL #3) 300-30 mg per tablet,


PROAIR HFA 90 mcg/actuation inhaler,

montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10 mg tablet,

fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray,




GASTROSTOMY TUBE, Button style. 14F. 2 cm length

oxybutynin (DITROPAN) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth.


tolterodine (DETROL LA) 4 mg 24 hr capsule, Take 4 mg by mouth.

norethindrone (AYGESTIN) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth.


aminocaproic acid (AMICAR) 25 % solution, Take 1 g by mouth as needed.

EPINEPHRINE (EPIPEN JR IM), Inject  into the muscle.

loratadine (CLARITIN) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized a variable pattern.  In general, there is an 8 Hz alpha
rhythm, but at times, it is better represented on the left than the right.  Intermittent attenuation of
faster frequency activity on the right is noted.  There are occasional bursts of focal slowing in the left
hemisphere



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the left
hemisphere becomes more rhythmic but the right hemisphere sometimes becomes a little bit more
irregular




Sleep is characterized by the features described above and FIRDA



Generalized slowing is present.

Focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Sharply contoured activity is noted on the left in drowsiness, rare



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Photic Stimulation: Did not activate the record





EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1.  Mild generalized background slowing


2.  Superimposed intermittent focal slowing from the right hemisphere

3.  Infrequent bursts of sharply contoured slowing from the left


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings may be correlated with imaging.  No epileptiform features were identified.



Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
