HISTORY:

21 y.o. male p/w history of seizure since the age of 12. Admitted to TUH
after having a total of 12 SZ this week.


PMH: Schizophrenia, BPD

Hx of drug abuse: Cocaine, Heroin, Marijuana, K2



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


busPIRone (BUSPAR) tablet 10 mg

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 500 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

valproic acid (DEPAKENE) capsule 500 mg



SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Posterior slow waves of youth are seen.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of  90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:




This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
