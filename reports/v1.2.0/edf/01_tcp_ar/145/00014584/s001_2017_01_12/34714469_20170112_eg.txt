HISTORY:

45 y.o. male with a history of TC seizures after sleep deprivation/EOTH/Stress
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth. 4 pills hs

QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


melatonin 3 mg Tablet, Take 3 mg by mouth at bedtime.

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 300 mg capsule, Take 300 mg by mouth 3 times daily.

DULoxetine (CYMBALTA) 60 mg capsule, Take 60 mg by mouth daily.


meclizine (ANTIVERT) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:





A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV  and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is low voltage, symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a
moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. There is prominent beta




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Single benign epileptiform transient of
sleep (BETS)  was noted from the left temporal region


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Produces an increase in amplitude of the background

Photic Stimulation: Driving response was elicited EVENTS:



There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal low voltage awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic
events reported or detected.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal  routine EEG. The BET is a normal variant.  A normal routine EEG does not support
or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
