HISTORY:

39 y.o. WOMAN PRESENTS WITH H/O DRUG ABUSE- OVERDOSE, NOTED
WITH SZ ACTIVITY T/C FOR 10 MIN.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of poorly organized mixture of alpha and
beta frequencies, with a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at best reaches 9.5 Hertz . The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present intermittently. Overall there is a
predominance of diffuse 5-7Hz activity with a times 1-4Hz activity.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild to Moderate diffuse slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This EEG reveals mild to moderate diffuse background slowing and mild disorganization.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
