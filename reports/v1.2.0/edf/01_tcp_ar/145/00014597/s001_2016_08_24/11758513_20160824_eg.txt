DATE OF STUDY: 08/24/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only




HISTORY:

a 60 y.o. male with a history of late onset seizure disorder with aura of mouth
tingling, most recently occurring 3 weeks ago, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal
events.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 3 capsules by mouth daily. Indications: EPILEPSY

dorzolamide-timolol (COSOPT) 22.3-6.8 mg/mL ophthalmic solution, Place 1 drop into both eyes
every 12 hours.


latanoprost (XALATAN) 0.005 % ophthalmic solution, Place 1 drop into both eyes nightly.

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.

carvedilol (COREG) 6.25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).


amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily.

furosemide (LASIX) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

cloNIDine (CATAPRES) 0.1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a poorly sustained low voltage 9-12 Hz
rhythmic activity posteriorly and a large amount of generalized low amplitude 20-30 Hz beta
activity. Frontotemporal muscle artifact was also seen.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 58 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. If clinically indicated, a
sleep deprived tracing capturing stage II sleep or ambulatory EEG may provide additional helpful
information.
