HISTORY:

54 y.o. male with a history of VBI, L pontine

CVA and episodes of LOC referred for routine EEG for possible


seizures.



MEDICATIONS:




SEDATION: none




TECHNIQUE:

Continuous video  21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

seizure and spike detection software.







Day 1: Jan 7-8 2016

EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is overall symmetric and includes vertex waves, K complexes


and spindles.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None signficant.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none, acute CVA patient

EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




Day 1 IMPRESSION:

This is a normal continuous EEG.  There are no clinical or


electrographic events reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.


For this patient with acute CVA, there were no major focal or

pathological findings
