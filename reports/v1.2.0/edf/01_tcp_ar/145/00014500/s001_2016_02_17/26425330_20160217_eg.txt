HISTORY:

62 y.o. male with a history of syncope

referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.


DRINKS 1 LITER OF RUM  A DAY AND PASSED OUT WHEN HE AWOKE HE WAS

ACROSS THE BED IN A DIFFERENT POSTION AND KNEW HE HAD LOST OF

TIME. PMHX. ETOH ABUSE NO prior seizures



MEDICATIONS:

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit, per

tech.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A digital video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was




recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG but no

HV and no photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is low voltage but symmetric, reactive, and

consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal


beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior

gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and


reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which

attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.




Brief Stage II Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients,

with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
