 HISTORY:

 26 y.o. male with a history of

 wedding and apparently without imbibing excess alcohol he had a


 convulsive episode lasting for several minutes. The seizure began

 without aura or other forms of anticipatory phenomenon and

 included the patient


 was confusion in a post ictal period but no apparent focality. No

 referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.  Past

 history of clubfoot and obsessive-compulsive disorder.


 NULL

 MEDICATIONS:

 Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


 amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet,

 lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 10 mg tablet,

 clomiPRAMINE (ANAFRANIL) 75 mg capsule,


 loperamide (IMODIUM A-D) 2 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.




 NULL

 No current facility-administered medications for this visit.

 NULL


 SEDATION: None

 NULL

 TECHNIQUE:

 A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


 International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

 NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and


 included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.

 NULL

 EEG BACKGROUND:

 The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


 mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

 activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


 Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz

 posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

 with eye opening.

 NULL


 During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

 fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


 background slowing are seen.

 NULL

 NULL

 Sleep- a single vertex wave was captured


 NULL

 No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


 NULL

 EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

 No epileptiform activity is present.

 NULL


 OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

 None


 NULL

 ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


 NULL

 Hyperventilation: Did not significantly activate the record


 NULL

 Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

 is a normal finding.  This was present even though the patient

 was drifting off to sleep

 NULL


 EVENTS:

 There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


 this study.

 NULL

 HEART RATE:

 A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


 NULL

 IMPRESSION:


 This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no

 clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.

 NULL

 CLINICAL CORRELATION:


 This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

 A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


 epilepsy.
