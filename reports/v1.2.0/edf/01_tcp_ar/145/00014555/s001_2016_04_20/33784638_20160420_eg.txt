HISTORY:

20 y.o. female with a history of autism and

seizures, no recent seizures.




MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

loratadine (CLARITIN) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.

white petrolatum-mineral oil (EUCERIN) Cream, Apply  topically.


polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) 17 gram packet, Take 17 g by mouth

daily as needed.

NORETHINDRONE-ETHINYL ESTRAD (ORTHO-NOVUM 7/7/7, 28, PO), Take


by mouth.

olopatadine (PATANOL) 0.1 % ophthalmic solution, Place 1 drop

into both eyes 2 times daily.


SODIUM FLUORIDE (PREVIDENT 5000 BOOSTER PLUS DENT), Place  onto




teeth.

levothyroxine (SYNTHROID, LEVOTHROID) 50 mcg tablet, Take 50 mcg


by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 systemwith T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5-11

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.


There is continuous eye movement and eye blink artifact.



Patient remains awake throughout the recording.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical


or electrographic events reported or detected.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.



No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not


recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep

recording may provide additional information.


Continuous eye blinking and eye movement artifact obscures


anterior EEG leads, so subtle anterior abnormalities might have

been missed.
