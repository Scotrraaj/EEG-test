DATE OF STUDY: 05/19/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy



HISTORY:

a 29 y.o. female with a history of recent alcoholic pancreatitis, seizure, persistent l
sided numbness and left scalp hematoma or dermoid cyst  referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

medroxyprogesterone (PROVERA) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


medroxyprogesterone (PROVERA) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation Aerosol Powdr Breath Activated, Inhale 180 mcg into the lungs
every 4 hours.


pantoprazole (PROTONIX) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.


SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:





A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV  and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.2 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  A single burst of slowing is noted once from the left
temporal region.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


WICKET, RMTD


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are several normal variants: Wicket and
RMTD
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
