SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic occurring at 1hzmorphology are present
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



No tests of reactivity (visual, auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli) are performed.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.





EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Generalized slow waves

2. Triphasic wave



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal EEG which is frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe diffuse
background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is
etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
