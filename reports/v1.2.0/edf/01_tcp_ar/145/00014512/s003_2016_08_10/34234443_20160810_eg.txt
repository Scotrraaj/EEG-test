DATE OF STUDY: 08/10/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 53 y.o. female with a history of PEA arrest, hypertension, Graves'
disease and seizure on 8/9, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


albuterol (PROVENTIL) 2.5 mg/0.5 mL nebulizer solution

potassium chloride 20 mEq in 100 mL IVPB

dextrose 5 % and sodium chloride 0.45 % infusion


ceFEPIme (MAXIPIME) 2 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB

atropine injection 0.5 mg

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB


hydrALAZINE (APRESOLINE) 20 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB

albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 5 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg


chlorhexidine (PERIDEX) 0.12 % solution 15 mL

hydrogen peroxide solution 3%



water, bacteriostatic injection 125 mL

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) suspension 650 mg


bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) suppository 10 mg

clotrimazole (LOTRIMIN) 1 % cream 1 Application


fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray 2 spray

heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

insulin regular (HumuLIN R,NovoLIN R) injection 1-5 Units

levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 37.5 mcg


nystatin (MYCOSTATIN) 100,000 unit/mL suspension 500,000 Units




TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel portable electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded at the bedside using
the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient was noted to be drowsy and restless during much of the tracing. She had intermittent
movements and responded to verbal stimulation with eye opening and closing. Background is
characterized by generalized low voltage beta activity, large amounts of muscle, eye blink and EKG
artifact. A small amount of poorly sustained, low amplitude (less than 10 uV) 6-8 Hz poorly organized
activity was seen over central and posterior scalp regions. In response to verbal stimulation,
increased muscle, movement and eye blink artifact was noted.





Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:

EKG monitor demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 80/m with occasional PACs.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized amplitude attenuation and mild slowing of background activity during periods of
maximum arousal.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are nonspecific and indicating mild diffuse disturbance of cerebral activity such as
that seen with a variety of generalized encephalopathies of various etiologies. No clinical or
electrographic seizure activity and no paroxysmal epileptiform discharges were recorded.
