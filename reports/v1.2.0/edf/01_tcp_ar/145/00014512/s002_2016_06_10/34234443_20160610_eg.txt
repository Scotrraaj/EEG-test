HISTORY:

53 y.o. female with a history of anoxic brain injury who remains in
coma.



MEDICATIONS:


No sedation

No AEDs




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The background consists of a mixture of attenuated polymorphic diffuse theta>>delta activity.  There
is no convincing reactivity to stimulation.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal comatose EEG due to:


1. Moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing

2. No clear reactivity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  When compared to the EEG from 6/8/2016, there has been improvement in the degree
of the background slowing.
