HISTORY:

53 y.o. female admitted after massive blood loss and PEA arrest.




MEDICATIONS:


No AEDs, no sedation since today's am.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




There is no PDR or AP gradient.



The background consists of attenuated very slow delta activity.  With stimulation, diffuse low
amplitude EMG artifact appears but the degree of the background slowing does not appreciably
change.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal comatose EEG due to:

1. Marked diffuse slowing and background attenuation

2. Lack of clear background reactivity.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
