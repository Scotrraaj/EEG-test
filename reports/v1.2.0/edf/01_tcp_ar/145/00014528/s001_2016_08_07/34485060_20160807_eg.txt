HISTORY:

38 y.o. male with a history of seizure, ICH s/p bilateral EVDs, with change in
mental status (more lethargic today), referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric.

The right hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of alpha, beta, and excess sharply
contoured delta. There is an alpha rhythm in the posterior leads of 9 Hz; it is unclear whether this
attenuate to eye opening and thus represents a posterior dominant rhythm.


The left hemisphere consists of a less well organized, more attenuated mixture of alpha and beta,
with excess theta and delta. There is no definite posterior dominant rhythm.




In sleep, the background slows further. Sharply contoured delta slowing over the right hemisphere
emerges. There are no well-defined sleep transients.



Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Attenuation of frequencies over the left hemisphere


3. Tachycardia



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of left hemispheric cortical dysfunction
superimposed on a bihemispheric cerebral dysfunction.



There was no epileptiform activity, nor any clinical or electrographic events captured during this
routine study. However, if subclinical status epilepticus remains a concern, long term EEG monitoring
is more sensitive in the detection of subclinical seizures.
