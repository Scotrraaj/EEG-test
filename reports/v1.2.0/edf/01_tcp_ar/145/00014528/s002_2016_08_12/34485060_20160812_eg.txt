HISTORY: 36 yo male found down at work s/p seizure. Pt has VP shunt. Found to have ICH,   Pt is more lethargic today, EEG to rule out seizures.   Right crani / evd placed near cz  PRESENTS FOR LTM/ R/O SZ
MEDICATIONS: levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB
SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.

DAY 1 (08/12/16 at 10:24AM - 8/13/2016, 08:00PM)

BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric. The right hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of alpha, beta, and excess sharply contoured delta. There is an alpha rhythm in the posterior leads of 9 Hz. There are continuous focal slow waves in the right hemisphere max in the frontal region. The left hemisphere consists of a less well organized, more attenuated mixture of alpha and beta, with excess theta and delta. There is no definite posterior dominant rhythm.  The asymmetry is consistent with a breach on the right hemisphere.  In sleep, the background slows further. Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE: A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

DAY 1 IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to: 1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Right hemisphere focal slow and breach

DAY 1 CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of right hemispheric dysfunction max in the frontal region superimposed on a bihemispheric cerebral dysfunction. There was no epileptiform activity, nor any clinical or electrographic events captured.
