HISTORY:

53 y.o. male who is in coma, now with episodes

concerning for seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs



SEDATION: Precedex and fentanyl until 4/12/2016.



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




There is no PDR or AP gradient.



The background is attenuated and consists of slow polymorphic

delta activity with very low amplitude underriding theta


activity.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Ventilator/ breathing artifact is present.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no change in the background

activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not

performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Severe diffuse slowing

2. Background attenuation

3. No clear background reactivity





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate etiologically nonspecific diffuse


cerebral dysfunction.
