HISTORY:

66 y.o. MALE P/W NEW ONSET SZ 3 WEEKS AGO.

PT HAD LOC WITH GEBERALIZED SHAKING LASTING 2 MIN. NO TOUNGE


BITING OR INCONT. AFTER THE EPISOSDE THE PT FELT DISORIENTED AND

HAD NO AURA. NEG FAMILY HX.



PMHX: STENTS, HTN, ANXIETY


MEDICATIONS:


LISINOPRIL, ASA, TRAZADONE




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the




International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.


Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present

throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness is seen.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Excess theta in wakefulness


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of  Mild


diffuse background slowing. This finding is indicative of mild

diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.


No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
