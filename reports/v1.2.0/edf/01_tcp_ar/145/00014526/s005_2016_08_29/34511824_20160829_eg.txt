SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse
disorganized delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.



Sleep is not captured



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left posterior quadrant region during
wakefulness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Abundant to almost continuous large field periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges are seen at
T5/P3 with a frequency that varies from 2-4Hz with no definitive evolution. This pattern is in the ictal-
interictal continuum.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clear clinical events associated with the PLEDs during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



1. Ictal-interictal continuum with left abundant posterior quadrant PLEDs and no clinical correlate.

2. Continuous focal slow waves present in the left posterior quadrant


3. Moderate diffuse slow waves and disorganization


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to an ictal-interictal continuum with left abundant
posterior quadrant PLEDs and focal slow waves, this pattern is highly epileptogenic and supportive of
an irritable structural lesion in the left posterior quadrant. In addition there is moderate diffuse
background slowing and  disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. This findings were communicated to the neurology team.
