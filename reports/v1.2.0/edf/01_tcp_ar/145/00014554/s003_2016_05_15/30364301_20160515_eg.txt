HISTORY:

91 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy after recent CVA, now with waxing and
waning MSE referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:

Previously on LEV, now receiving VPA.




SEDATION: Ativan during the EEG for seizure



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal  stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







As the study begins, patient is awake. The waking background is characterized by the presence of a
symmetric mixture of 4 Hz theta frequencies, with scant reactive 6 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There is a lot
of muscle and chew artifact and frontal beta.  The patient is demonstrates psychomotor slowing




A burst of frontal fast activity is followed by R temporal ADA and then sharp waves. The discharge
may have started before the EEG began but it is seen  At 10:39. When tested,  the patient has
speech arrest. She received 2 mg Ativan and afterwards, the EEG pattern shifts to symmetric theta,
with prominent delta, and the patient's speech returned.



Generalized slowing is present.

Shiftting  focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:R temporal sharp waves



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Sharpy contoured activity and FIRDA



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile stimulation elicits an increase in theta


EVENTS:


There was one  clinical / electrographic event captured during this study.  See above


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Clinical seizures, with challenging EEG correlate, but likely from the right.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are suggestive of an ictal process as a contributor to the confusion described by the
family.  Although the seizure was characterized by speech arrest, it seems to arise from the right.
