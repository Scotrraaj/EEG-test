SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude 7-8 Hz theta
activity.  AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient is weak.  Diffuse polymorphic theta activity is present.
Brief bursts of moderate amplitude frontally predominant delta activity are captured, increasing in
frequency in drowsiness (FIRDA).




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing

2. FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.



FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) is seen in nonspecific encephalopathy, increased
ICP, bilateral deep white matter lesions.
