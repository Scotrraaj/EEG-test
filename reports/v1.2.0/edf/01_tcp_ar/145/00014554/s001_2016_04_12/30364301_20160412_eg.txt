HISTORY:

91 y.o. female with a history of HTN

referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS: ASA, Norvasc



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a




mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen. There is bitemporal polymorphic

slowing in drowsiness, a finding within normal limits for an


individual of this age.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric POSTS, sleep spindles and K-complexes.


Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No pathologic focal slowing

is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
