HISTORY:

19 y.o. female who presents with change in

mental status, events concerning for seizures, high fevers.



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra


Propofol




SEDATION: propofol


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.

When the patient is agitated, the background consists of diffuse


slow delta activity with superimposed frequent brief generalized

sleep-spindle-like complexes. During periods of quiescence, the

background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta

activity, diffuse sleep-spindle-like waveforms and occasional


periods of discontinuity.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not


performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


Diffuse slowing - severe

No electrographic seizures.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep portable 23-minute EEG due

to severe diffuse slowing.


This finding is indicative of severe diffuse cerebral

dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but in this


patient, is at least partially to the medication effect.
