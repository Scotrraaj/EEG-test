HISTORY: 20 y.o. woman transfer from Jeanes due to abrupt bizarre behavior followed by clenched UE and stiff clenched LE, Rx benzos then propofol drip, aspirated, but w/d all ext. to pain and interactive, T103.
MEDICATIONS:
SEDATION:
TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.

DAY 1 (07/01/2016, 21:36 - 7/2/2016, 08:00)
BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized a burst suppression with intermittent burst that consist of disorganized diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. Some delta is at times sharply contoured but not clearly epileptiform.  There is frequent diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.   Sleep was not captured.
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured 102 bpm
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and burst suppression pattern.These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.

DAY 2 (07/02/2016, 08:00 - 7/3/2016, 08:00)
BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized a burst suppression with intermittent burst that consist of disorganized diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. Some delta is at times sharply contoured but not clearly epileptiform.  There is frequent diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. Around 5 PM the background appears to become more continuous with a diffuse delta with intermixed theta.  Sleep was not captured.
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured 102 bpm
DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and burst suppression pattern which improves mildly. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.

DAY 3 (07/03/2016, 08:00 - 7/4/2016, 08:00)
BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized a continuous with a diffuse delta with intermixed theta at varying degrees with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. At time the delta appears to be high amplitude maximally in the frontal regions an monomorphic for seconds consistent with frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).  There is frequent diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  Sleep was not captured.
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected
EKG: A single lead captured 126 bpm
DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and FIRDA. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.

DAY 4 (07/04/2016, 08:00 - 7/5/2016, 08:00)
BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized a continuous with a diffuse delta with intermixed theta at varying degrees with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. At time the delta appears to be high amplitude maximally in the frontal regions an monomorphic for seconds consistent with frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).  There is frequent diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  Sleep was not captured.
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected
EKG: A single lead captured 126 bpm
DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and FIRDA. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.

DAY 5 (07/05/2016, 08:00 - 7/6/2016, 08:00)
BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized a continuous with a diffuse theta and delta at varying degrees with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. There is frequent diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  Sleep was not captured.
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected
EKG: A single lead captured 102 bpm
DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.

DAY 6 (07/06/2016, 08:00 - 7/7/2016, 08:00)
BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized a continuous with a diffuse theta at varying degrees with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. A PDR reaches at best 7 Hz.  There is frequent diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  Normal sleep was not captured but state changes could be seen with some spindles.
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected
EKG: A single lead captured 102 bpm
DAY 6 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing and a slow alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.

DAY 7 (07/07/2016, 08:00 - 7/8/2016, 10:43)
BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   There is frequent diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  Normal sleep was captured
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected
EKG: A single lead captured 90 bpm 
DAY 7 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.
