HISTORY:

55 y.o. MAN R HANDED. PT. ADMITTED FOR

ALTERED MENTAL STATUS NOT INTERACTING WITH ANYONE USUALLY DOES


LAST 3 DAYS. PT FAMILY WITNESSED SZ. ARMS AND LEGS STIFF AND

TENSE AND MOUTH OPEN.PMHX. DEMENTIA,HTN,DM.




MEDICATIONS:

Keppra



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically




satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


characterized by diffuse marked low voltage delta and theta

activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior

gradient of frequencies.



There is minimal reactivity and variability to verbal and tactile

stimulation.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


The severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm are

etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral


dysfunction.
