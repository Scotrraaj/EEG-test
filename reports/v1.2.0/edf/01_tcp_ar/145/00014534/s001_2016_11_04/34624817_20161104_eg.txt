HISTORY:

38 y.o. male with a history of left temporal region gunshot wound in 2009 and
subsequent daily headaches and seizures characterized by right arm shaking and fluctuating mental
status. He was referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.




MEDICATIONS:

Keppra, Depakote.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by symmetric and reactive medium amplitude 10 Hertz
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Low voltage
anteriorly predominant 18-30 Hz activity was seen. A large amount of frontal eye blink artifact was
noted along with moderate amounts of frontal temporal muscle artifact.




During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Very brief stage II sleep was noted with increased low to medium amplitude slowing and vertex
waves.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm with infrequent PVCs is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
