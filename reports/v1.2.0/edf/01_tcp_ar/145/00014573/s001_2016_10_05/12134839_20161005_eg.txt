HISTORY:

38 y.o. female with a history of HBP and episode of LOC on 9/10, referred
for routine EEG for evaluation for possible seizure.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

METOPROLOL SUCCINATE ORAL, Take 25 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE ORAL, Take 12.5 mg by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:





A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10-12 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Low voltage 18-30 Hz activity is
seen, predominantly over frontocentral regions. A large amount of frontotemporal muscle artifact and
slow frontal eye movement artifact are seen.




Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 58 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.






A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
