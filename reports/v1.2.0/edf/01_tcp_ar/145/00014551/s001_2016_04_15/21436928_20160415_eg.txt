HISTORY:

61 y.o. female with a history of bipolar

disease and cervical pain.  She also has an ill-defined history


of funny spells or depersonalization referred for routine EEG for

characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

ARIPiprazole (ABILIFY) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.


lithium (LITHOBID) 300 mg CR tablet,

VENTOLIN HFA 90 mcg/actuation inhaler,

SPIRIVA WITH HANDIHALER 18 mcg inhalation capsule,


sumatriptan (IMITREX) 100 mg tablet,

oxybutynin (DITROPAN) 5 mg tablet,

clonazePAM (KLONOPIN) 0.5 mg tablet,


ARIPiprazole (ABILIFY) 30 mg tablet,




topiramate (TOPAMAX) 25 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2

times daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.


SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive

10.7Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.  The background is Rich in beta.


There is scant theta.  There appears to be an alpha harmonic in

the background.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Abundant 5 Hz rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness is noted.


It has the characteristic 5 Hz, flat top notch.  It is present

bilaterally but more so on the left than the right.  When the


technologist alerts the patient, it disappears in the alpha is

better defined



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation: Not completed



Photic Stimulation: Does elicit a driving response



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 50 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.


This EEG demonstrates a vigorous example of a normal variant.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more

prolonged study, capturing one of her spells may be of value.
