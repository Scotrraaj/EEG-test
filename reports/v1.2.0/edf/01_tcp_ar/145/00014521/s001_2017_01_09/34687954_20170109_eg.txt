DATE OF STUDY: 01/09/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake- sleep could not be achieved





HISTORY:

 a 48 y.o. male with a history of  mitochondrial disease, recent fall, possible loss
of consciousness, no history of seizures, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) tablet 200 mg

ketorolac (TORADOL) injection 30 mg


dextrose 10 % infusion

b complex vitamins capsule 1 capsule

amitriptyline (ELAVIL) tablet 100 mg


arginine HCl (L-arginine) Tab 2,000 mg

aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg

calcium-vitamin D 500 mg(1,250mg) -200 unit per tablet 1 tablet


cloNIDine (CATAPRES) tablet 0.1 mg

cyanocobalamin tablet 1,000 mcg



diazePAM (VALIUM) tablet 5 mg

levOCARNitine (CARNITOR) tablet 990 mg


metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) tablet 50 mg

multivitamin (THERA) tablet 1 tablet


potassium chloride tablet 20 mEq

triamcinolone (KENALOG) 0.1 % cream 1 Application

Coenzyme Q10 Cap 600 mg



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal  stimulation.


BP 115/66 (BP Location: Right arm, Patient Position: Lying)  Pulse 76  Temp 98.4 F (36.9 C) (Oral)

EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  There is prominent, generalized beta




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, and an increase in beta were noted



Sleep could not be obtained


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: not done

EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:



A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.


The generous beta described above may be due to the patient's medicines

CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an
important consideration, this study should be repeated in the lab with photic stimulation and sleep
