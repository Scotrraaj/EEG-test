DATE OF STUDY: 06/24/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:

AZITHROMYCIN, ALBUTEROL


SEDATION: none reported


TECHNIQUE:


An ICU portable  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.
Initially, there is a great deal of muscle artifact




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is diffusely slow, poorly organized.  There is relatively rhythmic theta, with bursts of
shifting arrhythmic delta.


Moderate generalized slowing is present.

Shifting  focal slowing is present.



Drowsiness is characterized by decreased eye movements and more of arrhythmic theta pattern


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


In a sharply contoured background, there is a single right temporal sharp wave

In addition, there are some posteriorly predominant poorly formed triphasic-like discharges



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Sharpy contoured activity



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile and auditory stimulation produced eye movement and muscle

EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal ICU routine EEG due to:

1. generalized slowing and poor organization.


2. subtle, posteriorly predominant triphasic-like wave forms


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are nonspecific.  They can be seen any toxic or metabolic encephalopathy as well as
a bilateral stroke syndrome.  Poorly formed posterior, triphasic-like discharges may be correlated with
imaging and clinical features. No seizures were recorded.





Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
