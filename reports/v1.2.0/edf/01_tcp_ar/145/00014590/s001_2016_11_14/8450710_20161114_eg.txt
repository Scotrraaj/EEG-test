HISTORY:

50 y.o. male with a history bipolar disease, ?IVDA? Recently  found jerking in

TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND: The patient is markedly drowsy.

The waking background is somewhat disorganized.  There are brief sections wherein the patient is
maximally awake when there is a 10 Hz upper rhythm but much of the time, the record is somewhat
slower with the 7-8 Hz alpha rhythm, generous frontocentral beta and generous diffuse theta.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  Hypersynchronous paroxysmal slowing is
noted with shifting asymmetries


Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained


Moderate generalized slowing is present.

Shifting focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per
second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.






EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal wake, drowsy routine EEG due to:

1.  Background slowing and disorganization


2.  Shifting slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are nonspecific.  They may be correlated with this patient's polypharmacy, bilateral
ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and or use of other sedating agents.  No epileptiform
abnormalities were identified
