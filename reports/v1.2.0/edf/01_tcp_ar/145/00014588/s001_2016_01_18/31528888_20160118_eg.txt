HISTORY: 29 y.o. female with SZS X 5 YRS.  SZ APPROX 2 A MNTHS. ???ASOC. WITH MENSTRUAL CYCLE.  FEELS HOT/ RING EARS/RUBS FINGER TOGETHER, / LOC/ GTC/ TONGUE BITE POST HEADACHE/ SLEEPY.  CONCUSION AGE 13.  MEDICATIONS: Keppra   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.    Sleep is not captured  No generalized slowing is present.    Intermittent focal slowing is present in the left anterior temporal region.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:        Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region       Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.   EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: 1. Intermittent left anterior temporal focal slowing   CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to intermittent left anterior temporal focal slowing.  This is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, which is non-specific with regards to etiology.
