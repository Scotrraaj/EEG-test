DATE OF STUDY: 05/11/16 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, asleep only EEG #: 16-860  HISTORY: a 37 y.o. male with a history of a recent cardiac arrest, now in a coma and worsening cerebral edema.  MEDICATIONS: No AEDs   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  EEG BACKGROUND: There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of monomorphic attenuated slow non-reactive delta activity.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.       Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.       Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.   EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of ~120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal comatose 1 hour routine EEG due to: 1. Marked diffuse slowing 2. Lack of the background reactivity  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings indicate the presence of etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.    Lack of the background reactivity after anoxic brain injury indicates poor chance of neurological recovery.
