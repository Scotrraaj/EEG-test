HISTORY:  A 44-year-old woman with epilepsy since birth,

seizure-free for the past 10 years, past history of asthma and


migraines.


MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin.



INTRODUCTION:  A 24-minute digital video EEG was performed in the

lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1


channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation

was deferred.  This was an awake and drowsy record.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there was a 9

Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal

central beta.  In drowsiness, there was a brief burst of


hypnagogic hypersynchrony.  Other features of drowsiness include

slow rolling eye movements, increase in central theta, and an

increase in beta.






Photic stimulation elicits driving and bilateral lambda.



Heart Rate:  96 bpm.



IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were

identified in this record.  Lambda and hypnagogic  hypersynchrony


are all normal findings.
