CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 35-year-old woman with 1 year history of

epilepsy, seizure at one point attributed to the patient's

medications.  Seizure free one month. Childhood epilepsy.




MEDICATIONS:  Tramadol.




INTRODUCTION:  A 1 hour -minute digital video EEG was performed

in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement

with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is unusual for an


adult of this age.  There is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, but there is

excess background theta and prominent beta.      Other features

of drowsiness include prominent beta and irregular bilateral


slowing.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves and spindles.

There is prominent beta in the transition in and out of sleep.

Shifting slowing was noted.  On one occasion, in the transition


to drowsiness rhythmic mid temporal theta was noted






Hyperventilation produces paroxysmal rhythmic slowing.  Photic


stimulation does produce driving response.




Heart rate:  104 bpm.



IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:

1. Background disorganization.


2. Excess theta.

3. Mild excess beta.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In the sharply contoured background, no

definitive sharp waves were seen.  This EEG is most supportive of

a mild diffuse disturbance of cerebral function including a toxic


or metabolic encephalopathy.




The rhythmic temporal 4.6-5.3 Hz activity noted in the first

study is seen again today but has the characteristic morphology

of the normal variant.  The second EEG for this adult without

definitive epileptiform activity.
