CLINICAL HISTORY: A 35-year-old woman with 1 year history of epilepsy, last seizure 2-3 weeks ago, seizure at one point attributed to the patient's medications.
MEDICATIONS: Tramadol.
INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is unusual for an adult of this age. There is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, but there is excess background theta and prominent beta. In addition, there is significant muscle artifact at F7-T3. In relaxed wakefulness/early drowsiness, there is rhythmic 4.6-5.3 Hz theta activity noted primarily in the left temporal region, but this is slightly irregular. Other features of drowsiness include prominent beta and irregular bilateral slowing.
Hyperventilation accentuates the underlying muscle artifact as well as producing paroxysmal rhythmic slowing, but again seems to slightly accentuate the findings on the left. Photic stimulation does produce driving response.
Heart rate: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to:
	•	Background disorganization.
	•	Excess theta.
	•	Excess beta.
	•	Potentially left temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In the sharply contoured background, no definitive sharp waves were seen. This EEG is most supportive of diffuse disturbance of cerebral function including a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. Exposure to other medications including those listed on the intake sheet might play a role.
There is rhythmic temporal 4.6-5.3 Hz activity, which has some irregularity. This suggests that this discharge is a pathological entity rather than rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness. Correlation with imaging may be of use. A follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
