HISTORY:

78 y.o. WOMAN P/W SZ. PT GOING TO LTM..



MEDICATIONS:

VERSED(4 MG), ATIVAN (2MG) ; phosphenytoin load complete



SEDATION: VERSED


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.


EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was




characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of

the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.



Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also


seen.


Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges at 1.5 to 2Hz in the


O2 region.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Left occipital PLEDs


2. Generalized slow waves


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

The left occipital PLEDs indicate that there is a focus of


irritable cortical structural dysfunction in the region. These

discharges are highly epileptogenic. In addition there is


evidence of diffuse background slowing and an absent alpha

rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators


of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Excessive beta activity

could be secondary to the medication effect, such as


benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Patient will be placed in

longterm monitoring.
