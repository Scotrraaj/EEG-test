TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
theta with admixed delta frequencies, with fragments of a symmetric and reactive 4-5 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present but suboptimal.




Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm and further
background slowing.



Moderate generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:



None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of the presence of a moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
