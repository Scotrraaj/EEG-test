HISTORY: 54 y.o. male with a history of seizures in setting of EtOH withdrawal and hemorrhagic stroke (noncompliant with AEDs and consuming EtOH daily) who was found at home having tonic-clonic seizures, and in the ER noted to have right gaze deviation and tonic posturing, referred for EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.   MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin load 15 mg/kg, now on 100 mg q8h  SEDATION: LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 4 mg midazolam (VERSED) 4 mg/hr  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/6/2016 01:30 EST - 11/6/2016, 06:00 EST)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous and symmetric, but consists of poorly organized featureless alpha and beta frequencies, without posterior dominant rhythm or sleep transients. There is no reactivity, variability, or state change.    There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. There is severe generalized slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 100s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing and background disorganization  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may at least in part be associated with sedation.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (11/6/2016, 06:00 - 11/7/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 90s-100s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (11/7/2016, 06:00 - 11/7/2016, 08:48)  BACKGROUND: consists of disorganized alpha, beta, and delta  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 90s-100s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change in degree of background slowing     -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Severe generalized slowing and background disorganization, with lack of reactivity   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may at least in part be associated with sedation.
