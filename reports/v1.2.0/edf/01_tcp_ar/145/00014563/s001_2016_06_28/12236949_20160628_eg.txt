DATE OF STUDY: 06/28/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 66 y.o. female with a history of symptomatic bradycardia who presented with a
seizure last night, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS: LORAZEPAM,DEPACON,LISPRO



SEDATION: meds as above



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and theta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7.5-8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but
suboptimal.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and further background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured.


Mild generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


1. At times theta activity is sharply contoured over the temporal regions independently, but is not
clearly epileptiform.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.


Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
