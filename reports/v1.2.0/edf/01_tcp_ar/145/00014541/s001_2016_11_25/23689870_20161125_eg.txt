 HISTORY: 39 y.o. female with a history of anoxic brain damage.    MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: dextrose 5 % in water solution 1,000 mL dextrose 5 % and sodium chloride 0.45 % infusion levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB ceFAZolin (ANCEF) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB MB+ magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg gentamicin PF 8 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   BACKGROUND: With stimulation, the background consists of up to 5 Hz theta activity posteriorly and a mixture of diffuse theta and delta activity.  During periods of quiescence, the background consists of predominantly delta activity with diffuse sleep spindle-like waveforms.      PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured an irregular heart rate of ~ 108 bpm.   IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal ~21-hour long term video EEG due to: Moderate to severe diffuse background slowing.  This finding is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  There were clear background reactivity as well as waveforms resembling normal sleep architecture - both of these are good prognostic indicators.  No electrographic seizures are captured.
