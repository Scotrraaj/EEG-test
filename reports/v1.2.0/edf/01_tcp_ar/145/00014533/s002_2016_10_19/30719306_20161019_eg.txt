SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of low-voltage asymmetric predominantly
theta activity with scant alpha and rare appearance of a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR)
which blocks earlier on the right. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is better preserved on the left. The record is complicated by significant EKG artifact.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.

Sleep is characterized by occasional vertex waves but is not sustained. Slow wave sleep was not
captured.


Intermittent generalized slowing is present with underlying subtle focal slowing on R>L.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
asymmetric photic driving, seen better on the left side.


EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE: A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Intermittent generalized slowing characterized by disruption of faster activity on the right and
asymmetric driving response


2. Underlying subtle focal slowing on R>L


CLINICAL CORRELATION:







These findings are frequently identified after stroke involving gray and white matter. There were no
epileptiform features seen.
