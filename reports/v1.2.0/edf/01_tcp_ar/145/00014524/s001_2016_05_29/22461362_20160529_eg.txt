 HISTORY: 47 y.o. male with a history of seizures referred for EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.  MEDICATIONS: No current outpatient prescriptions on file. No current facility-administered medications for this visit.   SEDATION: midazolam and propofol  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (05/29/16, 11:00PM - 05/30/2016, 06:00AM)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, low amplitude beta activity likely due to intravenous midazolam and propofol. The patient is intubated.    Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.  The background is not reactive, and minimally variable.  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Sleep was not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured sinus rhythm.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Diffuse attenuation and beta activity.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (05/30/16, 06:00 - 05/31/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: Patient is having more theta activity and less attenuation. Patient is extubated at 12:03PM. There is a fragmentary posterior dominant rhythm of 6-7Hz.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: there is mild excess low amplitude theta activity.   FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Occasional (1/hour to <1min) left mid-temporal spikes, maximal at T3.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured sinus rhythm.   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Diffuse attenuation and then as sedation is lifted and patient is extubated, there is the appearance of low voltage theta activity and left temporal spikes, T3.
