HISTORY:

52 y.o. man had arm pain and numbness for 2 days, stabbing chest pain. PEA arrest
at home, girlfriend preformed CPR went into V-Fib, shocked 3 times. 100% occlusion of right CEA.



MEDICATIONS:


Zosyn, Propofol, Lovenox, Plavix, Famotidine, ASA, Coreg, Vancomycin, Lipitor




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:





No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. With
stimulation more diffuse theta was seen.




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Moderate to severe diffuse slow waves


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake routine EEG due to moderate to severe diffuse background slowing and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe
diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
