DATE OF STUDY: 05/12/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep



HISTORY:

a 34 y.o. male with a history of possible diabetes, possible alcoholic hepatitis,
recent three-minute tonic-clonic seizure one month ago referred for routine EEG for characterization
of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.


SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically challenging
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:








The waking background is very low voltage, but symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of
alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior
gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  There is generous low-voltage
beta.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  Different electrode artifact is noted in
sleep




Sleep is characterized by spike in vertex waves, spindles and posts



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Elicits an increase in theta

Photic Stimulation: Patient is falling asleep but there is a brief driving response



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a technically challenging low-voltage but otherwise normal EEG.  There are no clinical or
electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


The low-voltage pattern is a nonspecific finding.  The excessive drowsiness may be due to sleep
deprivation.  Given the artifacts, , please consider a more prolonged study or at least a repeat study

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
