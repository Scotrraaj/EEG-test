HISTORY:

35 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy, severe TBI, now with elevated ICP, for
pentobarb therapy referred for routine EEG for medication adjustment.



MEDICATIONS:

SEDATION:  Peridex, propofol, vecuronium, keppra



TECHNIQUE:

A STAT portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The  background is characterized by the presence of a low voltage, featureless pattern with scant
beta, even less alpha frequency and shifting delta.



SEVERE generalized slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 85bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal ICU STAT EEG due to:


1. Replacement of normal pattern with low voltage suppressed pattern.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings suggest a severe CNS insults, but must be considered in the context of imaging and
use of sedative hypnotic medication.
