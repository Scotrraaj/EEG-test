HISTORY: 35 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy, TBI, ICP of 33, referred for EEG for medication adjustment. patient was found to have left frontotemporal contusions and a left subdural hematoma s/p left craniectomy, drain placement and ventriculostomy placement. CT demonstrated: Redemonstrated stable multicompartment hemorrhage status post left craniectomy. Subfalcian and descending transtentorial herniation again noted. No new hemorrhage or infarction identified. MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: sodium chloride 0.9 % with KCl 20 mEq/L infusion gentamicin PF 8 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL chlorhexidine (PERIDEX) 0.12 % solution 15 mL hydrogen peroxide solution 3% white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application Propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion Phenobarbital (LUMINAL) injection 200 mg vecuronium (NORCURON) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion amlodipine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg oxycodone (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 5 mg morphine injection 2 mg famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL multivitamin liquid 5 mL labetalol (NORMODYNE,TRANDATE) injection 20 mg hydralazine (APRESOLINE) injection 10 mg levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB   SEDATION: see Routine study, Vec, others.   TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile Stimulation.  A left craniotomy had been performed. DAY 1 (8/28/2016, - 8/29/2016, 08:00)  BACKGROUND:  The background is characterized by the presence of a low voltage, featureless pattern with scant beta, even less alpha frequency and shifting delta.   SEVERE generalized slowing is present.  Asynchrony between the 2 hemispheres is noted.  There was no evidence of reactivity to external stimuli  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.   DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Replacement of normal pattern with low voltage suppressed pattern. 2. Absence of reactivity  These findings should be interpreted in the context of this patient's clinical exam and anatomical imaging.  No epileptiform features were identified.   rev
