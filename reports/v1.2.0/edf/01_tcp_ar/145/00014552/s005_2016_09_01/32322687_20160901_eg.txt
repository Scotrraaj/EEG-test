HISTORY:

35 y.o. male with a history of severe TBI, elevated ICP, multi-compartmental
syndrome referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

metroNIDAZOLE (FLAGYL) IVPB 500 mg

fentaNYL (SUBLIMAZE) 1 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion


albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 2.5 mg

phenylephrine (NEO-SYNEPHRINE) 80 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL infusion

cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN) 2 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+


sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) injection 90 mg

gentamicin PF 8 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL


oxyCODONE (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 5 mg

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB






TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The  background is markedly abnormal; characterized by low voltage, asynchronous pattern with slow
delta, scant theta, intermittent suppression and rare low voltage beta.


Marked generalized slowing is present.

Shifting focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.




EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal bedside portable routine EEG due to:


1. Markedly slow, asynchronous background

2. There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are suggestive are supportive of a severe CNS insult. No seizures were recorded.
