HISTORY:

64 y.o. male with a history of  alcohol

abuse who fell down the stairs, suffering an L1/L4 fracture


referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.


MEDICATIONS:


None reported


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


tactile and auditory stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:



This is a very drowsy patient.  The primary pattern is a drowsy


pattern with medium amplitude theta background.  With generous

stimulation it is possible to find the waking background iwhich

is characterized by the presence of  a symmetric and reactive 7-8

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal


anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is

present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by vertex waves



Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: See above only



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. moderate background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific but support a diffuse disturbance

of cerebral function such as a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.

This vigorous stimulation, the patient does alert with a

relatively unremarkable background.
