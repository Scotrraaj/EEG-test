History:	65 Y/O MALE R HANDED EPISODES OF UNRESPONSIVE STIFF,FLEXED AND 
	UNRESPONSIVE FOR 10 MINUTES WITH BLADDER INCONT. PMHX. LEFT MCA 
	STROKE,DEMENTIA.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal 
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 84bpm
Summary of Findings:
	No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide 
additional information.
