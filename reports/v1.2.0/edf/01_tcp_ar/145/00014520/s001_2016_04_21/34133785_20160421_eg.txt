HISTORY:

55 y.o. male with a history of cardiomyopathy

and syncope referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal


events.


MEDICATIONS:


No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically




satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and


amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 55 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Reg



IMPRESSION:


This is normal routine EEG




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

NO Epileptiform features were identified but a normal EEG does

not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy
