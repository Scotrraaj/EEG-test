HISTORY:

56 y.o. female with a history of seizures, now presents after a seizure. Patient
has active delusions.



MEDICATIONS:


Dilantin




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. Due to patient's hair condition, many of
the leads are misplaced and occipital leads are moved forwards.  A single channel of EKG is
included.


EEG BACKGROUND:





The background consists of 9-9.5 Hz moderate amplitude reactive alpha activity with expected AP
(anterior-to-posterior) gradient and diffuse excess beta activity.



During drowsiness, alpha activity attenuates and diffuse theta activity appears.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

- excess beta

- No epileptiform discharges


- no stage II sleep

- technically limited (due to hair condition)



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep, albeit technically limited, EEG.

No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
