This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.    EEG BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Sleep is not captured  Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the F3/C3 region with associated loss of faster frequencies.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Some reactivity was noted with stimulation. EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION:  1. Continuous left fronto-central focal slow waves and attenuation 2. Moderate diffuse background slow waves.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the left fronto-central region and attenuation.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cortical cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin. In addition, there is moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
