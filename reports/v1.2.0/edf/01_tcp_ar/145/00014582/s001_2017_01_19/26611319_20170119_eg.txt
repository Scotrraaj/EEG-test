DATE OF STUDY: 01/19/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep



HISTORY:

a 58 y.o. male with a history of TBI referred for routine EEG for evaluation of
paroxysmal events.


58 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O LASPE OF MEMORY LASTING 5 HRS 11-6. PMHX SIG
FOR LEAD POISON AS CHILD, SURGERY ON BRAIN.


MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

meloxicam (MOBIC) 7.5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily for 360 days.

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 800 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily for 360 days.

ferrous sulfate (IRON, FERROUS SULFATE,) 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet, Take 325 mg by mouth
daily (with breakfast).


naproxen (NAPROSYN) 375 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).

TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of
alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior
gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 13 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by  sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep
spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


There are shifting asymmetries noted in stage II sleep.

No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: produces an increase in Beta

Photic Stimulation: is performed while patient in stage II sleep, with scant driving.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

HEART RATE: A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION: This routine EEG is WNL.  Minor asymmetries noted in stage II sleep may be a
reflection of previous craniotomy.  This record captured abundant stage II sleep.  Generous beta was
noted

CLINICAL CORRELATION: A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of
epilepsy.
