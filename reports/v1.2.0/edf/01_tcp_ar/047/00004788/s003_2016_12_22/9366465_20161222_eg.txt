HISTORY:

29 y.o. male with a history of childhood and encephalitis followed by
hydrocephalus, VP shunt developmental delay.  He has epilepsy with several seizures per week, now
critically ill in the ICU, referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.

TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and  Stimulation.  The patient
is intubated, has contractures, has very subtle motor movements during the EEG




EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is characterized by a relatively symmetric diffusely slow theta pattern with smaller
amounts of 2-3 Hz delta activity and frontal eye movements

Marked generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Minimal Tactile or verbal stimulation was documented



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:


1.  Markedly slow background




CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which
may reflect both a chronic encephalopathy and an acute process.  No epileptiform features were
identified
