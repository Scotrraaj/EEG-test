DATE OF STUDY: 01/17/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

 a 55 y.o. female with a history of multiple episodes of LOC of unclear etiology
(most recently 9/2016) referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy 1-hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy 1-hour EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.


If clinically warranted, a recording capturing stage II sleep may be helpful.
