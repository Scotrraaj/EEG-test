DATE OF STUDY: 04/29/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 26 y.o. female with a history of possible new onset seizures over the past month
(aura, LOC, tongue biting, eye rolling, foaming; once weekly), referred for routine EEG for evaluation
of paroxysmal events.




MEDICATIONS: Keppra


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There are
frequent 1-3-second bursts of polymorphic theta in the awake background.






During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:


1. Frequent bursts of 1-3 second duration of polymorphic theta during the awake background

Bradycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings may be consistent with a drowsy state. However, stage II sleep was not captured
during this study. Alternatively, these findings may reflect a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. If
clinically warranted, repetition of the study, capturing stage II sleep may be of benefit.




Bradycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.
