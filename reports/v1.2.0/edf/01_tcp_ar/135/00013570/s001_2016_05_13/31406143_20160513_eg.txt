DATE OF STUDY: 05/13/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only





HISTORY:

a 57 y.o. female with a history of change in mental status and a prior right sided
stroke vs AVM.



MEDICATIONS:

oxycodone




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.  Patient moved a lot throughout the study due to back pain.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 8 Hz theta activity, with poor AP
(anterior-to-posterior) gradient and diffuse excess polymorphic theta activity.





Patient remains awake throughout the study.



Subtle paucity of faster frequencies is noted over the right temporal region.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild diffuse slowing

2. Subtle mild right temporal focal slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.

Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the right temporal region.
