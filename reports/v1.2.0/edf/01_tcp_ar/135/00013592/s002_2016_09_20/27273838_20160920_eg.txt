DATE OF STUDY: 09/20/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep




HISTORY:

a 54 y.o. male with a history of seizures, presents with seizure, now referred for
routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


9/19 MEDS, DILANTIN, HALDOL, ATIVAN

9/20 MEDS DEPAKOTE



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




Most of the record consists of drowsiness and sleep.



During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



During brief periods where the patient arouses, a fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha and
beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), becomes
apparent. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but
suboptimal.




No generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal mostly drowsy and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Suboptimal organization


CLINICAL CORRELATION:








These findings indicate the presence of a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Alternatively, they may
indicate an excessively drowsy state. If clinically indicated, a repeat study when the patient is more
awake could be performed to distinguish between the two possibilities. There were no epileptiform
features identified during this study.
