HISTORY:

53 y.o. male with a history of DM, heart problems, and anxiety, with seizures
from ages 3-17; with recurrence of a seizure 1 month ago, now referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS: Xanax, Klonopin, Ambien



SEDATION: as noted in


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


Much of the record consists of what appears to be a drowsy pattern: there is fair organization with
diffuse admixed theta frequencies.




During brief periods of relative alertness, the waking background is characterized by the presence of a
well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9
Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is present.




Stage II sleep is not captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This awake and drowsy routine EEG is remarkable for:

1. Excess of drowsy pattern throughout record



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings possibly indicate a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Another alternative is an
excessively drowsy state.


If clinically warranted, a repeat routine EEG may be helpful to distinguish between these possibilities.
