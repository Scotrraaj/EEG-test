HISTORY:

88 y.o. WOMAN S/P CODE X2. 18 MIN AND 26 MIN

MOST RECENT 3/29. NO SEDATION.  ECS EVAL.  ADM WITH SOB/ VOLUME


OVERLOAD. FOUND TO HAVE HIP FX. NO SEDATION IN OVER 1 WK.



MEDICATIONS:



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. This

EEG was performed according to the guidelines of the American


Clinical Neurophysiology Society for the determination of




electrocerebral inactivity.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


characterized by diffuse very low voltage almost suppresed delta

activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior

gradient of frequencies.



There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no

change with visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Severe diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal come portable EEG due to severe diffuse

background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are


etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral

dysfunction.


This EEG is not consistent with brain death.
