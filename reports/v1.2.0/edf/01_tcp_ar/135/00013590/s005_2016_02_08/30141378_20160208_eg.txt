DATE OF STUDY: 02/08/2016

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only






HISTORY:

a 74 y.o. MAN LUNG TRANSPLANT ON . PT HAD

AMS ON . STROKE ALERT NOT MOVING LEFT SIDE. CTH NEG.



 FOLLOW UP




MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was

characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity


with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies. Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with

triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording.  These

waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


1. Triphasic waves

2. Diffuse slowing, Moderate



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to frequent

frontally-maximal triphasic waves and moderate diffuse background


slowing.  These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse

encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but


suggestive of a metabolic origin.






Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents

my findings and conclusions.
