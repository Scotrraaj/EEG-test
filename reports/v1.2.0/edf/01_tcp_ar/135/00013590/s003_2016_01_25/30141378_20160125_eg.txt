START DATE OF STUDY: 01/25/2016 at 12:13 END DATE OF STUDY: 1/27/2016 at 09:30  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU EEG TYPE: long term monitoring EEG #: 16-23  HISTORY: a 74 y.o. male who is s/p lung transplant and found to have a right hemiparesis with encephalopathy and right gaze deviation and head shaking. He required intubation for obtundation. He is now referred for EEG for assessment of mental status change and episode of right gaze deviation on 1/25/16.  MEDICATIONS: heparin; loaded with Dilantin 1/25  SEDATION: None listed  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (1/25/2016, 12:13 - 1/26/2016 06:00)  MEDICATIONS: loaded with Dilantin, placed on Versed gtt at 1 mg/hr ~ afternoon 1/25  EEG BACKGROUND: Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  The background is not clearly reactive or variable.  Sleep transients are not seen.  No focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: 1. Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs, also known as LPD+F or lateralized periodic discharges with admixed faster frequencies) are present in the O1 region at a rate of 0.5-1 Hz.  By the evening, the discharges no longer have admixed faster frequencies (LPD).  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: Several electrographic seizures are captured originating from the left occipital region: 12:45, 12:56, 13:07, 13:19, 13:32, 15:11, 15:25, 16:18 CLINICAL: There is no obvious change in the patient's clinical activity. Camera is aimed at his left side; his eyes cannot be seen well on video review. Caretakers at the bedside do not seem to clearly react to any change in his clinical status. EEG: For some seizures (i.e., 12:45), left occipital PLEDS organize into sharply contoured theta with superimposed faster frequencies, then slow to 2-3 Hz spike and wave, increasing in amplitude. Other times (i.e., 12:56), the pattern is reversed, and the seizure begins with 2-3 Hz spike and wave in left occipital region, evolving into rhythmic theta with superimposed faster frequencies, then rhythmic 2-3 Hz spike and wave again. As each pattern progresses, there is spread of ictal activity first to the right occipital region, then throughout the left hemisphere, then more diffusely EKG: No definite change in heart rate  EKG: A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal drowsy routine EEG due to: 1. Left occipital electrographic seizures 2. Left occipital PLEDs 3. Moderate diffuse slowing  This is an ABNORMAL EEG, diagnostic for seizures of left occipital origin. Lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in the left occipital region are indicative of a highly potentially epileptogenic acute focal destructive lesion in the region.   In addition there is continuous diffuse background slowing. This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.     Reading attending:     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (1/26/16, 06:00 - 1/27/2016 06:00)  MEDICATIONS: Dilantin is supratherapeutic; Versed gtt d/c'ed ~09:45 1/26  BACKGROUND: As the day progresses, the background becomes more variable and rare spontaneous lateral and vertical eye movement artifact is detected.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs, also known as LPD) in the O1 region at a rate of 0.5-1.5 Hz. These do not evolve. As the day progresses, these discharges become nearly continuous, with periods of up to 5 seconds without PLEDs.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 100s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  1. Left occipital PLEDs, appearing less epileptogenic in morphology and decreasing in prevalence from continuous to nearly continuous 2. Moderate diffuse slowing, improving to mild to moderate diffuse slowing as the day progresses No electrographic seizures thus far.  Reading attending:    -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (1/27/2016, 06:00 - 1/27/2016, 09:30)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change from previous day  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s-110s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change from day 2  Reading attending:       -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is abnormal video EEG due to: 1. Left occipital electrographic seizures seen on day 1 2. Left occipital PLEDs, improving in frequency, prevalence and morphology by day 2 3. Moderate diffuse slowing, improving to mild to moderate diffuse slowing by day 2 4. Periods of tachycardia  FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of an epileptogenic focus in the left occipital region. Hyperexcitability from this region improved by day 2. There is additionally etiologically nonspecific evidence for diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which improved to mild to moderate by day 2. Periods of tachycardia were noted on a single EKG lead.  Reading attending:
