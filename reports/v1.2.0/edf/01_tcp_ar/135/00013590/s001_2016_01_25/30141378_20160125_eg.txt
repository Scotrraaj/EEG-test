DATE OF STUDY: 01/25/2016

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy




HISTORY:

a 74 y.o. Man s/p LUNG TRANSPLANT ON . PT

HAD AMS ON . STROKE ALERT NOT MOVING LEFT SIDE. CTH


NEG.  EEG TO RULE OUT SZ.  PER NURSE 01/25 AM PT HAD RIGHT SIDED

EYE GAZE  - INTUBATED




MEDICATIONS:

Heparin


Ativan


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None






TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.


EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of

the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.



Sleep is not captured


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) are present

in the O1 region at a rate of 0.5 Hz.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy routine EEG due to:


1. Left occipital PLEDs.

2. Moderate diffuse slow.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of the continuous periodic

lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in the left occipital


region.  These findings are indicative of a highly potentially

epileptogenic acute focal destructive lesion in the region.  In

addition there is continuous diffuse background slowing. This

finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction,


which is etiologically nonspecific.  No electrographic seizures

are present.



Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents

my findings and conclusions.
