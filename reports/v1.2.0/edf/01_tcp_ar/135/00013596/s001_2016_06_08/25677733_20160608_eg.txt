HISTORY:

40 y.o. male admitted with basilar artery occlusion.



MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:






The background consists of diffuse monomorphic low-to-moderate amplitude 9-10 Hz alpha activity.
Occasionally, primarily without provoking factors, EEG changes and becomes briefly (~1-5 seconds)
attenuated with prominent of diffuse beta activity.




No normal sleep architecture is captured.




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal routine EEG in a comatose patient due to:

1. Primarily alpha coma pattern



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Alpha coma is an uncommon pattern seen in patients' with a locked in syndrome.  However, some
evidence of background reactivity are captured.
