HISTORY:

43 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy for many years, though he can't describe
seizures, recent fall with high R FC sm hemorrhage referred for routine EEG for characterization of
seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

morphine injection 2 mg


pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg

ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) tablet 100 mg


LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 1 mg

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:





A bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG .




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is somewhat slow and is characterized by the presence of a symmetric
mixture of theta, alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is  Not sustained

Mild  generalized slowing is present.


Occasional R/L temporal  focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Occasional (1/hour to <1min) R Mid to anterior temporal sharp waves or spikes were seen, wake,
drowsy states.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 63 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. R temporal sharp waves and spikes

2. Mild background slowing


3. Shifting temporal slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:




These  Epileptiform findings may represent the pre-existing epilepsy pattern. The slowing may be
due to medicines, TBI or other toxic-metabolic process.
