HISTORY:

55 y.o. male with possible seizures.



MEDICATIONS: none listed




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a




mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates


symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal Awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no


clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.

A normal record does not rule out a convulsive disorder. If

clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
