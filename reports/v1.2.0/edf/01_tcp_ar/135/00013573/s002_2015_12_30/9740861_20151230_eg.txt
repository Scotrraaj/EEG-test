CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old male with epilepsy, followup

EEG.


MEDICATIONS:  Unclear


INTRODUCTION:  A 24-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab

using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel

EKG.  Hyperventilation was not completed.  Photic stimulation was


completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is


well organized with symmetric reactive 9 Hz posterior dominant

rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by paroxysmal rhythmic

background slowing.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.




Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.




Heart rate 78 bpm.



IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.







CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 2nd normal EEG for this adult.

The previous EEG demonstrated tachycardia.  If epilepsy is an


important consideration, a follow up study with a more prolonged

study may be helpful in search of epileptiform activity.
