HISTORY:

57 y.o. female who was admitted after having a whitnessed cardiac arrest. EEG to
evaluate for seizure activity. Pt has twitching mvmt of bilateral eye lids.


pmh: DM, HTN, Epilepsy, Substance abuse, and HTN



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:

labetalol (NORMODYNE) tablet 200 mg


labetalol (NORMODYNE,TRANDATE) injection 20 mg

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 5 mg

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB


sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg



acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+


cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN) 1 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse very
attenuated delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.





Sleep is not captured



Severe generalized slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

Stimulation reveals muscle reactivity.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of  60bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



1. Severe diffuse background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
