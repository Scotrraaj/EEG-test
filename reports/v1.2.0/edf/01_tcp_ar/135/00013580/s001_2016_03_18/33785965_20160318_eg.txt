HISTORY: 22 y.o. male with a history of seizures since childhood (2008), resulting in TBI; as well as Crohn's disease, reporting a seizure most recently on 3/17/2016 (convulsions once every 2 weeks).  He was admitted 3/12 with hallucinations and transferred to Episcopal.  He is now transferred to TUH and referred for EEG for characterization of seizures.  MEDICATIONS: Keppra 500 q12h, VPA 500 q12h, Topamax 50 daily  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.   DAY 1 (3/18/2016, 19:58 - 3/19/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, fairly-organized, and consists predominantly of beta, theta, and delta (with admixed alpha), with excess of beta frequencies. Posterior dominant rhythm approaches 8 Hz.  There is mild to moderate generalized slowing. There is no focal slowing.  Drowsiness is characterized by further background slowing and fragmentation of posterior dominant rhythm. Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, including synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate of 68 bpm  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal video long term EEG due to: 1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Excess of beta frequencies.  These findings are consistent with mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Excess beta can be seen in the setting of a medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (3/19/2016, 06:00 - 3/19/2016, 13:21)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: in addition to the abnormalities noted on day 1, today occasional 10-second bursts of irregular diffuse delta are seen in wakefulness  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS:   3/19/2016, 10:05 CLINICAL: patient is lying in bed awake when he suddenly shakes his left leg, then both legs synchronously rapidly. He lays back, opens his mouth in an apparent grin, closes his eyes, and rocks his trunk rapidly forward and back. His nurse says, "are you alright?" and he opens his eyes and responds verbally.  He states his name and follows simple commands immediately. At this point he has stopped shaking his trunk but still flexes and extends his thighs. He names a pen. When the nurse asks, "why are you shaking?" he puts his hands to his face and says, "I don't know." He is oriented to place and time. EEG: The background is obscured by shaking artifact. EKG: no change in heart rate  The patient rips the leads off his head on 3/19/2016, 13:21.  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 110s-120s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Mild to moderate diffuse dysfunction. Excess beta. Single episode of whole body shaking captured as described above correlates with EEG movement artifact and is most consistent, both semiologically and electrographically, a nonepileptic behavioral event. Tachycardia.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Excess of beta frequencies 3. A shaking episode captured on 3/19/2016 at 10:05 that is most consistent with a nonepileptic behavioral event 4. Tachycardia noted on 3/19/2016  FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are consistent with mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Excess beta can be seen in the setting of a medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. The episode described above is most consistent with a nonepileptic behavioral event. Tachycardia is noted on 3/19/2016.
