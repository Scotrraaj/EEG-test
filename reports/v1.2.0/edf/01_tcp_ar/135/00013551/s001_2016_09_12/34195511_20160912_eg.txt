HISTORY:

57 y.o. male with a history of hepatic failure referred for routine EEG for assessment
of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

lactulose (CHRONULAC) 20 gram/30 mL solution 30 goxyCODONE (ROXICODONE) immediate
release tablet 5 mgheparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units pantoprazole(PROTONIX) EC
tablet 40 mg rifaximin (XIFAXAN) tablet 550 mgspironolactone (ALDACTONE) tablet 100 mg


TECHNIQUE:


A bedside  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.  The
patient was in isolation during the EEG




EEG BACKGROUND:







The background is actively abnormal.  When the patient is maximally awake, the overall pattern is
arrhythmic 4-5 Hz theta pattern.  There are bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity, more prominent
on the left than the right. However, at times the rhythmic theta on the right is slower FIRDA is noted.
Marked  generalized slowing is present.



Shifting focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

FIRDA

Sharply contoured slowing in the temporal regions was noted


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  stimulation produces an arousal with more rhythmic theta EVENTS:
There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Irregular



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Markedly slow background with many hallmarks of a metabolic encephalopathy including FIRDA.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are nonspecific, can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or other diffuse,
bihemispheric disturbance.  There were no epileptiform features noted.  There were no triphasic
waves noted
