HISTORY:

23 y.o. 23 Y/O PT IS A MALE NON

ENGLISH SPEAKING WHO HAS A HX OF SZ. PER HIS COMPANION. PT. LAST


SZ, WAS 10-2015. HIS SZ. ARE DESCRIBED AS LOSING VISION, BECOMING

RIDGIT, CONVULSING,BITING TONGUE AND INCONT.PT FEELS LIKE HIS

UPPER EXTREMITIES ARE ALWAYS WEAK.




MEDICATIONS:



DEPAKOTE X2 1500 MG




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:




A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

The patient complained of feeling dizzy and at one point felt


like he was going to have a seizure. No abnormal changes were

seen.

He did have a sudden jerk from sleep and a myocgenic artifact was

seen on EEG. No clear EEG epileptiform correlate could be seen.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1Hr EEG.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 1 Hr EEG. There are no

electrographic events reported or detected.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
