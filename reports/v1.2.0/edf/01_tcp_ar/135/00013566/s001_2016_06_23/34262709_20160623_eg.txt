DATE OF STUDY: 06/23/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only




HISTORY:

a 27 y.o. male with a history of autism and obsessive-compulsive
disorder.  Patient had an episode in which he told his mother he needed to sit, was briefly
unresponsive, staring in unresponsive for 10-20 minutes.  Returned to baseline without difficulty
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) 25 mg capsule, TAKE ONE CAPSULE BY MOUTH TWICE A DAY

LORazepam (ATIVAN) 0.5 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH TWICE A DAY


naltrexone (REVIA) 50 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY DAY

ziprasidone (GEODON) 80 mg capsule, TAKE ONE CAPSULE BY MOUTH AT BEDTIME

ziprasidone (GEODON) 40 mg capsule, TAKE ONE CAPSULE BY MOUTH EVERY MORNING




TECHNIQUE:





A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Scant driving was noted


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Slightly irregular


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  The patient was unable to fall asleep during the 20
minute study.





If epilepsy is an important consideration, please consider a more prolonged study.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.



Attending Epileptologist: 


I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
