HISTORY: 57 y.o. male who presents with anoxic brain injury as a result of prolonged smoke inhalation.
MEDICATIONS: None listed
SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
DAY
BACKGROUND: There is no PDR or AP gradient. Early in the recording the background consists of ~ 5 second bursts of diffuse frontally predominant delta activity admixed with periods of discontinuity and frank burst suppression. As the recording progresses, there is gradual disappearance of bursts of activity with little discernable cerebral activity seen by the end of the recording epoch.  Sleep was not captured.
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captures heart rate of ~ 120 bpm.
IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal 15-hour long term video EEG due to: Severe diffuse slowing that progresses to near complete burst-suppression pattern.  These findings indicate marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, that, in the absence of sedation, indicates severe diffuse cerebral insult.
