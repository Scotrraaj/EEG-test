HISTORY:

66 y.o. female with a history of L posterior

temporal lobe infarct and change in mental status presenting with


possible seizures.


MEDICATIONS: ATIVAN,WARFARIN,VIMPAT, INSULIN, ATORVASTATIN,


METOPROLOL, ADVAIR, FAMOTIDINE


SEDATION: meds as above



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was at times a technically limited study,

with muscle artifact obscuring both right and left hemispheric


leads at times. The study included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous and asymmetric.

The right hemisphere has fair organization and consists of a


mixture of alpha, beta, and excess theta. Fragments of an

irregular posterior dominant rhythm approaching 10 Hz are seen on

the right.

The left hemisphere has poor organization and consists of delta


and theta frequencies. Delta is most predominantly seen over the

temporal chain and posterior parietal area. There is no posterior


dominant rhythm.


Drowsiness is characterized by further slowing of the background.



Sleep transients are not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Continuous left temporal and posterior parietal polymorphic

slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


An irregularly irregular heart rate is captured on a single EKG

lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing


2. Suboptimal organization on the right

3. Poor organization on the left

4. Continuous left temporal and posterior parietal polymorphic

slowing


5. Irregularly irregular heartbeat



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of left temporal and

posterior parietal dysfunction, likely structural in etiology,

superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


An irregularly irregular heart rate is captured on a single EKG

lead.
