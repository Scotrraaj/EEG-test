 HISTORY: 56 YO FEMALE PRESENTS WITH CARDIAC ARREST STARTING HYPOTHERMIA PROTOCOL, NO OTHER HX AT THIS TIME.    MEDICATIONS: DOPAMINE -- IS ALL THE NURSE CURRENTLY KNOWS  SEDATION: Unknown  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 and 2 (03/22/2016 at 08:17 PM - 3/24/2016, 07:00)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm is present. The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen.  There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording. There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli.  This EEG was not performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.  Sleep was not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured 66 BPM   DAY 1 & 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an isoelectric EEG this is indicative of severe diffuse cerebral cortical dysfunction which may be due at least in part to medication or cooling effect. No prognostic conclusions can be made as the patient was on hypothermia.
