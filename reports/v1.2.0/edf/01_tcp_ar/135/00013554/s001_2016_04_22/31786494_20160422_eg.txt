HISTORY:

22 y.o. WOMAN S/P HODGKINS LYMPHOMA

STAGE 4. FINISHED TREATMENT 1/2015.  APPROX 1 MONTH INTO


TREATMENT HAD EPISODES OF LIGHTHEADED, TUNNEL VISION/LOC. SHAKING

WITH POST TIRED.  STILL HAVING THEM APPROX 1 X MONTH.



MEDICATIONS:

DULERA, LORATADINE, MONTELUKAST, VALACYCLOVIR, VENTOLIN



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, and




photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.



Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical


or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
