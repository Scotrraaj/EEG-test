HISTORY:

This is a 23 y.o. right handed male admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: refractory epilepsy. He states that he has a long aura before all seizures,
always knows that they are coming but can never take a rescue tablet. He feels a pressure in his head,
and an indescribable sense.





Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Characterization of seizures.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.









- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.




Initial MEDICATIONS:levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 150 mgVPA




DAY 1 (09/05/2016- 9/6/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND:



The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric,  well-organized, and consists predominantly of
alpha with admixed frontocentral beta. 10 Hz Posterior dominant rhythm was   Present. The
background is  reactive,  variable.


There were  no persistent asymmetries in amplitude - there is subtle underlying left temporal slowing.

Wicket is present bilaterally.





Sleep was characterized by  symmetric sleep spindles and/or K-complexes.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Occasional wicket waves are noted during
drowsiness over the temporal regions.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: in wakefulness, but more prominently in drowsiness and sleep there are
bursts of frontal notched theta/delta of 0.5-3.0 seconds duration. Some have clear spike and wave
morphology.  Others include a frontal sharp or spike or pair of discharges followed by slow wave



Some are R frontal max, others clearly bifrontal and less frequent, left frontal. ACTIVATION
PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.

HR 100-130 BPM

DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Although there is subtle L temporal slowing, the interictal epileptiform activity is frontal-generalized.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:


Interictal Findings:

1. Isolated frontal sharps/spikes

2, Isolated 5-7 Hz s/w complexes, occur in pairs


3.bifrontal spike and wave with polyspike of ~12 Hz, total burst duration 3-7 seconds, no clinical

3.Some bursts start with 12-15 Hz activity




4. 12 Hz spike and wave activity or paroxysmal bursts



Ictal Findings:

The patient had 1 tonic clonic seizure while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the
epilepsy monitoring unit.  This was a generalized discharge, with out clear lateralization.


SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Generalized epilepsy with little evidence for focality



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1.Generalized epiepsy



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video EEG.  This
was an  EMU monitoring session



The interictal EEG is characterized by generalized spike and wave, with relatively little in the way of
focal slowing or sharp waves. This data will be presented at surgical conference to discuss the
possibility of surgical evaluation versus medical managment.




Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
