HISTORY:

23 y.o. male with a history of medically refractory epilepsy referred for routine EEG
for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 500 mg

topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 150 mg

topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 200 mg


VPA on hold




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG HV, and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There is generous
beta.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


generalized slowing is present.


Intermittent left temporal focal slowing is present in Drowsiness and HV. There is overlaying Wicket as
well.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Rhythmic, spiky mid-temporal theta/ delta noted on the left, no clear spikes



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: elicits L temporal focal slowing



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal  routine EEG due to:

1. Left temporal sharply contoured slowing, accentuated by HV



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are non-specific. EMU to follow
