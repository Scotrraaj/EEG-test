HISTORY:

45 y.o. female who presents with irritability,

paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions, with a history of


schizophrenia, referred for routine EEG for assessment of

psychosis.



MEDICATIONS: HYDROXYZINE, NAPROXEN, VENTOLIN, HALOPERIDOL,

TRAZODONE, COLACE, DIPHENHYDRAMINE, AMITRIPTYLINE, DEPAKOTE



SEDATION: meds as above


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system and utilized a NicOne system. This was

a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel


of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha, beta, and theta


frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior

dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient

of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse

cerebral dysfunction.
