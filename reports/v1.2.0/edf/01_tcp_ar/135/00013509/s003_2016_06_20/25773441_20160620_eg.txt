History: 46 yo RH male presents for evaluation for epilepsy.  AVM at age 8, intervention, nonsurgical.
Lifelong use of Tegretol, now developing frontal headaches and left-sided numbness

Medicines: Metoprolol, Tegretol


Introduction:

Routine portable Digital video EEG was performed in lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement and one channel EKG.   Patient is awake/sleep.  Hyperventilation + Photic
stimulation were performed.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG.




Description of record:

Wakefulness is characterized by a somewhat slow and disorganized pattern with mixed theta and
bursts of arrhythmic delta activity R>L.  There is reactive  alpha rhythm of approximately 7-8Hz.


Sharply contoured slowing was noted in the right central temporal region.

Intermittent, frontally predominant intermittent rhythmic delta activity was noted


Drowsiness: Characterized by An increase rhythmic theta

Sleep: stage II was not achieved.

Hyperventilation produces an increase in bilateral delta.


Photic stimulation did not activate the record

EKG: NSR 66 BPM



Impression and Clinical Correlation:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 20 minute EEG



1. Mild generalized slowing.

2. Disorganization



3. Sharply contoured slowing from the Right central temporal region

These features are nonspecific but support a mild, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  In
addition, the sharply contoured slowing in the right central temporal region may be correlated with
imaging and clinical features.  No definitive epileptiform discharges were identified.  Consideration
of a one-hour EEG may be helpful in that regard
