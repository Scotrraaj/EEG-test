HISTORY: 65 y.o. female with a history of left MCA stroke and epilepsy, presenting with acute onset aphasia and right hemiparesis in the setting of negative perfusion imaging, referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.  MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Vimpat, Depakote  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (8/4/2016, 12:41 - 8/4/2016, 16:34)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous and asymmetric. The right hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of alpha and beta, with a reactive posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz. The left hemisphere consists of attenuated delta activity with admixed faster frequencies, without a posterior dominant rhythm.  During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and further background slowing are seen.   Sleep is characterized by spindles and K complexes that are seen better over the right hemisphere.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Continuous periodic spike-wave over the left posterior quadrant occurring every 0.5-1 Hz  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 70s  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Suboptimal organization 2. Continuous attenuation and slowing over the left hemisphere 3. Continuous lateralized periodic discharges over the left posterior quadrant  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are indicative of left posterior quadrant highly epileptogenic potentials superimposed on left hemisphere cortical dysfunction and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.
