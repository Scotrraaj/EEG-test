HISTORY:

64 y.o. WOMAN WITH CC OF SEIZURE.  PMHX: LEFT CVA.  RIGHT SIDE
WEAKNESS/NUMBNESS.  PT APHASIC.  FOLLOW UP EEG.



MEDICATIONS:


VIMPAT, KEPPRA, DEPAKOTE, TRAZODONE


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There an excess 5-
7Hz activity during wakefulness.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region maximal at T3 during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Almost continuous periodic large field left hemisphere maximal temporal spike and polyspikes are
seen at 0.5-1 Hz periodicity. There are consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges
(PLEDs)


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. PLEDs left hemisphere large field.


2. Left midtemporal focal slow

3. Mild diffuse slow waves





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to left hemispheric PLEDs and continuous
focal slowing, which is indicative of a irritable structural lesion which potentially epileptogenic.


In addition there is mild diffuse background slowing and slowing of the alpha rhythm.  These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
