HISTORY:

65 y.o. female with a history of left MCA stroke and epilepsy, presenting with
acute onset aphasia and right hemiparesis in the setting of negative perfusion imaging, referred for
EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 24 hr tablet 1,000 mg

lacosamide (VIMPAT) tablet 200 mg


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 1,500 mg

aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg

FLUoxetine (PROZAC) capsule 10 mg


heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

hydrochlorothiazide (MICROZIDE) capsule 12.5 mg

dextrose 50% injection 25 mL




dextrose 50% injection 50 mL

glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg


insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg


rosuvastatin (CRESTOR) tablet 40 mg

traZODone (DESYREL) tablet 50 mg

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg




SEDATION: s/p ativan 2 mg



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with
T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and
included a single channel of EKG.





DAY 1 (8/5/2016, 13:12 - 8/6/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous and asymmetric.

The right hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of alpha and beta, with a reactive
posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz.


The left hemisphere consists of attenuated delta activity with admixed faster frequencies, without a
posterior dominant rhythm.



During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and further
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by spindles and K complexes that are seen better over the right hemisphere.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Continuous periodic polyspike-wave (LPD+FR) over the left posterior quadrant occurring every 1 Hz






EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 70s-80s



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

1. Suboptimal organization

2. Continuous attenuation and slowing over the left hemisphere


3. Continuous lateralized periodic discharges over the left posterior quadrant



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are indicative of left posterior quadrant highly epileptogenic potentials superimposed
on left hemisphere cortical dysfunction and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No clinical or
electrographic events were reported or detected.



-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 2 (8/6/2016, 06:00 - 8/7/2016, 06:00)


BACKGROUND: No change


Note that L hemispheric leads are uninterpretable due to artifact on 8/6 from 14:58-16:48, and 8/6
20:12-21:48



GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change



FOCAL SLOWING: No change


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No change



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s-70s





DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


No change from day 1.

Limited study during times noted above.



-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 3 (8/7/2016, 06:00 - 8/8/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND: No change

Leads are disconnected 8/8 01:40-03:48, 8/8 04:37-05:04.



GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change



FOCAL SLOWING: No change


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected


EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s




DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



No change.




-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 4 (8/8/2016, 06:00 - 8/8/2016, 08:52)



BACKGROUND: No change



GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change


FOCAL SLOWING: No change



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change


EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s




DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



No change.






-----------------------------------------------------------------



FINAL IMPRESSION:



This is an abnormal video EEG due to:


1. Suboptimal organization

2. Continuous attenuation and slowing over the left hemisphere


3. Continuous lateralized periodic discharges over the left posterior quadrant


FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are indicative of left posterior quadrant highly epileptogenic potentials superimposed
on left hemisphere cortical dysfunction and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No clinical or
electrographic events were reported or detected.
