HISTORY:

57 y.o. male with a history of pontine stroke, alcohol abuse, hepatitis C, and an
episode of unwitnessed syncope versus seizure on July 1, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of
paroxysmal events.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.





SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by symmetric and reactive 15 uV Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. A large amount of muscle and eye
blink artifact is seen.




During brief drowsiness, reduction in muscle artifact and beta activity are noted along with slowing of
the posterior dominant rhythm and diffuse background slowing.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
