HISTORY:

41 y.o. female with a history of recent onset of seizures referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

tiZANidine (ZANAFLEX) 4 mg tablet, Take 4 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed.

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 100 mg/mL solution, Take 10 mg/kg by mouth daily.


flurbiprofen (ANSAID) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily for 360 days.

oxycodone-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 10-325 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 4
hours as needed for Pain.


gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 400 mg capsule, Take 400 mg by mouth 3 times daily.

fluticasone-salmeterol (ADVAIR) 100-50 mcg/dose diskus inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every
12 hours.


Albuterol (PROVENTIL,VENTOLIN) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every 6
hours as needed.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz, 70 mV posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Hypnogogic hypersynchrony was also noted during drowsiness. Sleep is not captured. No generalized
slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.


EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

HEART RATE: A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
