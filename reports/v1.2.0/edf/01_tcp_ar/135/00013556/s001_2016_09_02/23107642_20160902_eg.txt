DATE OF STUDY: 09/02/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy



HISTORY:

a 57 y.o. woman p/w dizziness since sunday. pmhx: Dilantin toxicity, Anxiety/
depression, SZ



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) tablet 90 mg

sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (BACTRIM DS) 800-160 mg per tablet 1 tablet


fluticasone (FLOVENT HFA) 110 mcg/actuation inhaler 2 puff

levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 125 mcg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg


ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg

docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg



senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


multivitamin (THERAGRAN) tablet 1 tablet

aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a symmetric mixture of alpha and theta
frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).


Excessive theta in wakefulness is seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:



A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



1. Excessive theta in wakefulness


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing.  This
finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No seizures
or epileptiform activity was seen.
