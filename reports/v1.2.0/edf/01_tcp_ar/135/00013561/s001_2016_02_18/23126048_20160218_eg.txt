History:	40 year man with a questionable history of a prior seizure in the setting of possible 
	heroin overdose.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow 
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.  
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at 
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
	No focal slowing or epileptiform discharges
	No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 26-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, 
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may 
provide additional information.
