HISTORY:

30 y.o. FEMALE WITH ?  EPILEPSY FOR

THE PAST X2 YEARS.


H/O SLEEP PARALYSIS.

Three types of spells

#1 - paralysis with falling asleep, or waking up


- last episode 2016

- thinks overall less frequent than before

- had sleep study dx'ing OSA at Jeanes, but never saw physician


and was not given CPAP


#2 - shaking/stiffening, or waking up in a different room


- 1-2x/month (MORE frequent than before)

- one time woke up running into her dining room table



#3 - episodes of things going black, and everything shaking but




being aware of it

- thinks overall less frequent than before: once a month


*unclear if this is really a subtype of type #2

Past history of heroin addiction, anxiety and depression.


TECHNIQUE:

Continuous Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)

was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included seizure and spike detection


software with 24 hour technical and clinical supervision

-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY1 (03/28,  - 3/29/2016, 06:00)



AEDs: topiramate held



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is 40 uv symmetric and

reaches 9.5 Hz.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured..


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not

performed.



SEIZURES/EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


EKG: A single lead captured HR 60-80 BPM


EMG lead: muscle activity decreased in sleep (normal)


-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 2 (03/29/, 06:00 - 3/30/2016, 06:00)


AEDS: TPM on hold, continues on Methadone, Klonopin

BACKGROUND: normal 9 Hz alpha



GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change


FOCAL SLOWING: None



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Rare Mu and central theta


of drowsiness


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



EVENTS: None



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60 BPM, regular


EMG lead: muscle activity decreased in sleep (normal)

DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study. Normal EEG


-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 3(03/30, 06:00 - 3/31/2016, 07:30)

AEDS: TPM on hold, continues on Methadone, Klonopin


BACKGROUND: normal 9 Hz alpha


GENERALIZED SLOWING: less background theta.



FOCAL SLOWING: None



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Rare Mu and central theta

of drowsiness


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



EVENTS: None. She is often drowsy around 1 PM.



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60 BPM, regular


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric

background slowing.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



EKG: A single lead captured HR 60-70 BPM , regular


EMG lead: muscle activity decreased in sleep (normal)






Impression: This 72 hour continuous video EEG monitoring session

the seizure and spike detection did not identify epileptiform


activity, clinical seizures or behaviors which resemble seizures.

Sleep was relatively normal, though not sustained.  Intermittent

theta was noted which may be attributed to the use of sedative

hypnotic medications.


Clinical notes:

Of note, after the patient's EEG recording was discontinued,


after her morning methadone dose, she fell asleep and had

asymptomatic second-degree AV block which resolved in followup

EEG.



The patient prefers to continue on topiramate which she feels has

helped her symptoms.  She plans to have her husband videotape her


nocturnal events and review those with her neurologist in

followup
