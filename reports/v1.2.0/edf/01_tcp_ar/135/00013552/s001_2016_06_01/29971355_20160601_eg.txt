HISTORY:

57 y.o. male with a history of cardiac arrest 3 days ago who remains comatose.



MEDICATIONS:

No sedation




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.





The background consists of a mixture of 2 distinct patterns.  (1) a mixture of diffuse moderate
amplitude polymorphic fast theta and delta activity.  Theta activity is frequently sharply contoured
(especilly over the frontal and central leads) and somewhat rhythmic (without clear evolution).




(2) waxing and waning high amplitude rhythmic nonevolving 2.5-3 Hz generalized frontocentrally
predominant spike and wave discharges.  Even though they are more likely to appear with
stimulation, they also occur spontaneously.  There is no clear clinical correlate with these runs.




No normal sleep architecture is seen.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 80 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal comatose 1 hour  EEG due to:

1. Subclinical generalized waxing and waning status epilepticus



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding represents diffuse cortical irritability.  Patient will be placed on continuous EEG
monitoring.
