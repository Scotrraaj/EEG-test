HISTORY:

57 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy, ONSET 10 YRS AGO, SZ ARE WITH
LOC AND POSTICTAL CONFUSION. LAST SZ 6/2015, referred for routine EEG for characterization
of seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


Phenytoin


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive scant 7.5-8 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Frequent drowsiness seen, during drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and
fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild slowing of alpha rhythm is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Occasional wicket waves seen in temporal region.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving upto 7 Hz, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Mild slowing of alpha rhythm.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of mild slowing of alpha rhythm are suggestive of etiologically
non specific mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.   This was an excessively drowsy patient. Consider a
repeat study with cognitive testing (counting backwards) to make sure maximally wake state was
captured.
