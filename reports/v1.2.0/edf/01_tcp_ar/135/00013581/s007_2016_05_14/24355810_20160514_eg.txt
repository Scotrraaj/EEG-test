HISTORY:

65 y.o. male with a history of schizophrenia and probable prior stroke.  Little is
known about the patient who was found down in a boarding home and had fever, right-sided
weakness and change in mental status referred for routine EEG for screening for status epilepticus.




MEDICATIONS:

Zyprexa, nifedipine,

Ceftriaxone


Depakote, Ativan Phenobarbital




TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with
T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and
included a single channel of EKG, tactile and verbal stimulation. Seizure and spike detection
software was used.




DAY 1 (May 12, 2016, May 13, 2016, 06:00)




BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by a remarkable asymmetry.  On the left there is the
presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and
reactive 8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of
frequency and amplitude is present.



The right hemisphere demonstrates significant attenuation of faster frequency activity with a lower
voltage delta pattern

Focal slowing is present. Posterior dominant rhythm was present on the left.



There were  persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was characterized by slowing on the left and an increase in beta

After the use of versed,. A slightly discontinuous pattern with frontal fast and theta was noted.

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Rare (<1hour) Sharply contoured slowing T4, but few interictal spikes.


EVENTS:


Multiple electrographic seizures were captured of 30-120 seconds duration.

The patient is awake, not very interactive prior to the seizures.  Few clinical features are noted.  His
left arm is flexed and he may have some oral movements. He tends to sit up at the start of some
seizures, may look to right (aide and window are on the right) but is speaking coherently during some
seizures.  On one occasion he had tremulous movements of UE, R>L.  On other occasions he has
circular movements of the right hand (5:48 PM).





The ictal pattern is a burst of 13 Hz activity, maximum at O2, sometimes with frequency evolution to
a slower spike and wave. There is some variability in spread to P4 and PZ.  There is little post ictal
slowing
At the evening continues, seizures increase in duration, may begin with 16 Hz activity with longer
and slower ending (10:10 PM).  The patient is increasingly drowsy after infusion of seizure medicines
and is intubated after the this and placed on Versed drip at 14.




EKG: A single lead captured 104 BPM



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Multiple simple or subtle CPS maximum in the right posterior quadrant.   Clinical features not much
different than interictal behavior, but patient may lift R arm or have automaticsms and does not use L
arm.





Therapy was stepped up and seizures resolved after intubation and use of versed.


-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 2 (May 13, 2016, May 14, 2016)


AEDs: Versed, dose tapering down.


Technical notes: patient is intubated and sedated

INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:


Continuous, low voltage, somewhat attenuated on the right

Patient may arouse with EOM and theta background


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Rare (<1hour)  Subtle F4 Fz sharps



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



SEIZURES/EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


EKG: A single lead captured HR 94 BPM



DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

No seizures, sedated background.



-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 3 (May 14, 2016-May 15, 2016)



AEDs: Versed, dose tapering down. Phenobarbital


Technical notes: patient is intubated and sedated

INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:


Continuous, low voltage, somewhat attenuated on the right. The record is lower voltage and slower
than the previous day, but them more vigorous with more beta after 11 PM.


Patient may arouse with EOM and theta background

GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change



FOCAL SLOWING: No change


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare (<1hour) F4/Fz



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected


EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 90 BPM




DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



No seizures, sedated background.



-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 4 (05/15/2016, 06:00 - 05/16/2016, 10:00)


AEDs: Versed, dose tapering  off. Phenobarbital

EEG electrodes sometimes disconnected by patient.

BACKGROUND: continuous, low voltage, somewhat attenuated on the right. Delta/theta background
with frontal beta


Patient may arouse with EOM and theta background.



GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change





FOCAL SLOWING: less prominent



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None but rare sharply contoured slowing T3


EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured 90 BPM




DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


No additional seizures. No spikes.






-----------------------------------------------------------------



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patients interictal findings were  insignificant



ICTAL FINDINGS:


Multiple seizures, R Occipital parietal, resolving with versed infusion on May 12, 2016. EEG
monitoring was discontinued when the patient was awake and extubated.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. complex partial



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. complex partial



CONCLUSION:



was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4days with continuous video EEG
for focal status epilepticus.


The interictal EEG is characterized by normal, posterior dominant rhythm on the left only.



Patient is to  follow-up with at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
