HISTORY:

65 y.o. male with a history of recent focal status epilepticus.



MEDICATIONS:

Phenobarbital




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.





The background over the left consists 9-10 Hz low amplitude alpha with expected AP (anterior-to-
posterior) gradient.


The background over the right lacks sustained PDR and AP gradient.  It consists of attenuated up to 7
Hz theta activity posteriorly, atenuation and paucity of faster frequencies over the right middle and
posterior quadrants.




Patient remains awake throughout the recording



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only portable EEG due to:

1. Continuous moderate focal slowing and attenuation over the right middle and posterior quadrants.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the right.
