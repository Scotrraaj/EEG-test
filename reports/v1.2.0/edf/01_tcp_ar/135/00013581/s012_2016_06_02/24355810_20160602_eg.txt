 HISTORY: 65 y.o. male with a history of status epilepticus referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.  MEDICATIONS: VPA, PB  SEDATION: Ativan  TECHNIQUE: A bedside portable  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.  EEG BACKGROUND: The background is characterized by the presence of a low voltage, slow delta pattern. Though the patient is never interactive, tactile stimulation produces an increase in low to medium amplitude alpha, with scant PDR and low voltage theta, better seen on the left and at times R FC regions.  Modest generalized slowing is present.   Right focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to: 1. Generalized slowing. 2. R focal slowing 3. Clinical psychomotor slowing   CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings indicate the presence of a structural process on the right. No epileptiform features were seen. This EEG is a bit slower than the May 25, 2016 study.
