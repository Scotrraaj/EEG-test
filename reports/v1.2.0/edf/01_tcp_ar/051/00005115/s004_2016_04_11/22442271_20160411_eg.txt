HISTORY:

72 y.o. MAN WITH CC OF SEIZURES.  PRIOR EEGS.

PMHX: SZS, DM, HTN, CAD/CHF



MEDICATIONS:

DILANTIN, DONEPEZIL



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was

characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity


with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies.



Some intermittent alpha frequency waveforms were seen in the

fronto-central region with stimulation.



Normal sleep arqutecture is not captured but state changes are

noted.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate to severe generalized slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

The moderate to severe diffuse background slowing and absent


alpha rhythm are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate

diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


No seizures were seen.
