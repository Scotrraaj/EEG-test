SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a very limited record due to continuous

temporalis artifact and included a single channel of EKG (not

functioning), HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The limited waking background is characterized by the presence of

a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies,

with a symmetric and reactive10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm

(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and


amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left

anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during


drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent bursts of F7/T3  sharp waves are seen with no clear

evolution.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

The EKG could not be read.



IMPRESSION:

1. Frequent left anterior temporal sharp waves in bursts


2. Intermittent left anterior temporal focal slow



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal limited awake and drowsy routine EEG due to


left anterior temporal sharp waves in bursts and focal slowing.

These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic area


of focal cerebral dysfunction in the region.
