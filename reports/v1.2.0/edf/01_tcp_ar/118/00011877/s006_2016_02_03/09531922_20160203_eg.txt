HISTORY:

This is a 52 y.o. LH woman with seizures since age 6 months.


Her seizures began related to high fevers.


Seizure description:


Type 1: Suddenly has T-C shaking for 1-3 minutes, eyes open.

Denies tongue biting or bladder incontinence. Afterwards she may

be confused for 1 hour. Current 5-6 per month. After may feel


panic.


Type 2: Sometimes may feel something a sit down. Next she stares


for up to 10 minutes. Denies tongue biting or bladder




incontinence. Afterwards she may breath heavily and she is

confused for 10 minutes. They may occur 3-4 daily.

MRI BRAIN WO CONTRAST (poor quality) 09/19/12

Impression: Grossly stable MRI when compared to the prior study

of 5/10/1925 and 3/17/2006. No acute infarction.



MRI brain 08/11/2015


Conclusion:

1. Suboptimal evaluation secondary to patient motion artifact.

2. No acute intracranial process.

3. Volume loss in the left hippocampus with questionable subtle


T2 hyperintensity that may represent left mesial temporal

sclerosis.


4. Mild cerebellar atrophy.



MRA intracranial circulation

Conclusion: Unremarkable MRA of the intracranial circulation



Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Recording of seizures for


presurgical evaluation.


Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more

of the following reasons:


- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or

clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and


morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and

determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left

untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual

mortality rate.


- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient

number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are


reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures

and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus;

- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures

and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient


safety during seizures;

- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these


medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses

to document patients exam

(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG

monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:


A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of

monitoring.  The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG

monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were

placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20


international electrode system.  Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9,

T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.


Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances

were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was


recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored

to computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently


reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.




Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and

computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG

activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8

hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A


neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.

The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a


registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and

testing.  During times when a technician was not available, EEG

recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and

nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.



The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program


(trademark named

time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.

Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were

reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and


detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external

hard drive media.

SEDATION: None



DAY 1 (2/1/2016, 13:16 - 2/2/2016, 08:00)



MEDS:

Lamictal 100-100

Zonegran 400 qhs

Vimpat 200-200



BACKGROUND:



The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized,

and consists predominantly of alpha with admixed beta.



Posterior dominant rhythm was present and 10 Hz.



The background is reactive and variable.



Note that interpretation of the waking background is limited due

to constant chew artifact.



When the patient stops chewing, continuous polymorphic delta


slowing over the left temporal region is present.


Well-formed sleep transients are not seen.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Near continuous left anterior temporal (F7/T3) sharp waves are

seen at 1-2 Hz with no clear evolution. In drowsiness, these have

a broader field, with phase reversal over left central region


(C3).

*In sleep, these occasionally change in morphology to rhythmic


delta at 1-2 Hz, again with no clear evolution. At times they

fluctuate up to 4 Hz but do not meet electrographic criteria for

evolution.

When patient is awakened and asked whether she has symptoms


during these discharges, patient does not clearly endorse

(example: 2/2/16 06:16, 06:20).


2. Occasional right fronto-centro-temporal (T2/F8/T4, with field

that extends to include F4/C4) sharp waves, increasing to

frequent



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or

detected.



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is an abnormal video EEG due to:


1. Suboptimal organization, absence of well formed sleep

transients


2. Near continuous left anterior temporal (F7/T3) sharp waves at

1-2 Hz with no clear evolution, at times with a broader field,


with phase reversal over left central region (C3).  *In sleep,

these occasionally change in morphology to rhythmic delta at 1-2

Hz, again with no clear evolution.

3. Occasional right fronto-centro-temporal (T2/F8/T4, with field


that extends to include F4/C4) sharp waves, increasing to

frequent

EVENT TYPE: event of unclear etiology - patient pushes button

CLINICAL: patient is sitting up in bed with hands clasped,

fiddling with both fingers. She reaches and pushes event button

with left hand. Tech comes to assess patient, and she claims to


be having a seizure. Nurse appears and performs testing, and

patient appears to follow commands slowly.


EEG: there is no clear EEG cerebral correlate. Background appears

well organized without spiking when the patient pushes button. By

the end of the event, what appears to be her interictal spiking

appears in the left temporal region

EKG: single lead recording suboptimally


(2) DATE AND TIME:   2/2/2016 at 12:06

EVENT TYPE: event of unclear etiology - patient pushes button


CLINICAL: patient is sitting up in bed with hands clasped.

Presses event button at 12:06 with left hand. Tech comes over to


assess and she appears to converse with him (sound is not

working). She follows commands.

CLINICAL: mother is feeding patient dinner. Patient stops chewing

and head drops slightly. Mother and family push the tray away.


Patient is not attending to them, still has head flexed forward

and is blinking. Nurse comes into room and pushes button. Patient


answers questions and follows commands. She complains of left arm

pain (which she complains of at baseline). Mother endorses this


as a typical habitual staring episode the following day on

rounds. Note that there is no sound on video review.

nodding movements, eyes are closed. Sister points at her and

pushes button for


she is, but does answer other questions and follows commands. She

denies stomach or arm pain.  Mother endorses this as a typical


habitual staring episode the following day on rounds. Note that

there is no sound on video review.

EEG: no clear change in interictal background

forward, blinking. She is otherwise completely still. Sister

presses button for


patient; she appears at first to not respond to gentle tactile

stimulation, but then follows commands a couple minutes later.

Mother endorses this as a typical habitual staring episode the

following day on rounds. Note that there is no sound on video


review.

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

were not performed



SEIZURES/EVENTS:



(1) DATE AND TIME:   2/5/2016 around 10:52

EVENT TYPE: unclear etiology; but mother identifies this as

typical habitual staring episode


CLINICAL: patient sitting in chair. Has chewing movements.

Intermittently looks towards mother who is on her right. Has


chewing mouth movements and shifts legs as though restless.

Intermittently scratches her neck/face, and shakes her legs, and

purses her lips as though restless. Wipes nose with left hand

(10:56). She leans forward and attends to mother, then leans


back, and then after a minute leans forward again (10:58). Note

that there is no sound available on video review. It is difficult


to tell exactly at what point mother thinks she developed a blank

stare. Mother did not push button but enters room for

rounds at 11:00 and mother says that patient had

seizure just a couple minutes ago.


EEG: there is no change in the EEG awake background, which is

obscured by constant chew artifact


DURATION: unclear

POSTICTAL CHANGES:  No change

EKG: recording suboptimally



(2) DATE AND TIME:   2/5/2016 at 14:48

EVENT TYPE: unclear etiology; but mother identifies this as


typical habitual staring episode

CLINICAL: patient is sitting up in bed, using tablet and

wiping/scratching her face/nose with left hand. At 14:48:28 she

drops the tablet on the bed and neck flexes forward slightly.


Mother comes over, takes tablet away, and pushes button. Patient

not responding to mother. Tech begins protocol. She attends to


tech but does not speak. She does not respond to orientation

questions. She does not follow commands. At 14:50, she begins


follow commands. She identifies family members in teh room. She

cannot answer orientation questions (though this can be


baseline).

Event #1: CPS 2nd T-C

Date: 02/08/2016 Time: 08:20PM



Clinical features: While in bed playing with iPad she places it

on the side and sits up in bed the suddenly starts moving both

hands side to side irregularly with her head down midline and


brings her legs up (flexed hip and knees) towards her body then

she stops. Next her left harm becomes slowly supine and stretched


tonically and her right arm flexes with a fist for ~15 seconds.

She then flexes her left arm and then starts moving around. This

continues as the the seizure ends. She is unresponsive to verbal

and motor commands.



EEG features: Clinical onset preceded by EEG onset by around 30


seconds. There is a fast rhythmic discharge (with 20hz high cut

filter) over the left hemisphere maximal left frontotemporal

region which spreads to the right fronto temporal region in 5

seconds and later more diffusely. The discharge slows down in


frequency and increases in amplitude until it suddenly stops.

There is diffuse slowing afterwards.


Seizure last


HR: EKG lead was not working properly due to movement




Event #2: CPS 2nd T-C


Date: 02/10/2016 Time: 2:24PM


Clinical features:

While sitting on the chair playing on the iPad suddenly stops and


puts it away as for help from someone on the left. She then sits

back and stares, she has chewing movements (has this at baseline)


then she slowly turns her head to the left and lifts her left arm

(not well visualized). Her right arm is covered but seconds later


appears slightly dystonic then becomes flexed and clearly

dystonic as she slumps to the left. Seconds later her her returns


to the midline and she appears to have irregular intermittent

jerky movements. Afterwards she appears confused and moves


around.


EEG features:

The EEG onset is largely obscured by muscle artifact but with (20


hz high cut filter on) there appears to be a left hemisphere

maximal fronto-temporal faster frequency discharge clearly seen


about 10-12 seconds after clinical onset. It then evolves to

theta discharges that spreads to the right fronto temporal region

and then more diffusely. This discharge continue to slow down and

then stop.



Seizure last ~50 seconds



HR: EKG lead was not working properly due to movement



INDUCTION PROCEDURES:


1. Sleep deprivation

2. Exercise

evolution.


2. Occasional right fronto-centro-temporal (T2/F8/T4, with field

that extends to include F4/C4) sharp waves, increasing in sleep





Ictal Findings:

The patient had 2 clinical events while hooked up to continuous


video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy monitoring unit which appear

to lateralize to

the left.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Focal seizures



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising

from the left frontal or temporal region



CONCLUSION:


was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit

for 11 days with continuous video EEG.  The interictal EEG is

characterized by very frequent left anterior temporal large field

sharp waves and less frequent right anterior temporal sharpwaves.


Focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region indicates a

focal structural lesion in that region. Frequent left anterior


temporal and less frequent right anterior temporal epileptiform

discharges indicate a potentially epileptogenic focus in that

region. The two seizure are suggestive of left temporal vs

frontal onset.



The patient was weaned off her medications over the course of her


admission. She was restarted on her medication on the day prior

to her discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes

were made during the hospitalization.



She will be presented at surgical conference along with a PET

scan as a next step in her surgical evaluation.
