History:	54 YO MALE WITH HX OF SYNCOPE AND COLLAPSE, CONVULSIONS, AND 
	SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER. PT SAYS ITS BEEN OVER A YEAR SINCE HE 
	HAS PASSED OUT / COLLAPSE. 
	PMH: DM, HTN
Medications:	PT IS ON MEDICATION, CAN NOT RECALL THE NAMES OR WHAT THEY ARE 
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the 
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central 
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and 
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.  
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.  This 
finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
