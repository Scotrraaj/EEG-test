HISTORY:

34 y.o. male with a history of psychosis and seizures after TBI with
encephalomalacia and gliosis of the


right parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes as well as of the left

frontal and temporal lobes  referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 200 mg tablet, 200 mg 2 times daily.

INVEGA SUSTENNA 117 mg/0.75 mL Syringe,

XARELTO 15 mg Tablet,


carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) 200 mg tablet, Take 200 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, 2,000 unit Tablet, Take 2,000 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

IRBESARTAN-HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE PO, Take  by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.






SEDATION: none



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation. R craniotomy defect was noted.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized but low voltage and
asymmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with an  asymmetric,  but reactive 10 Hertz
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), noted best on the left . The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of
frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained



No generalized slowing is present.

Right sided focal slowing is present.  The activity on the right is lower voltage, and lacks the richness
of faster frequency activity seen on the left.  Mu is noted only on the left.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: produces an increase in amplitude



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces  photic
driving on the left.


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.






HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. R focal slowing.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with a focal process on the right.  The low voltage
pattern and scant alpha on the left is within normal limits. There were no spikes.
