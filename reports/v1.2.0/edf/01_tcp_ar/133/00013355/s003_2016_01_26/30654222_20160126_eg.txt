START DATE OF STUDY: 01/26/2016 at 11:24 END DATE OF STUDY: 01/28/2016 at 13:25  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 24 y.o. female with a history of migraines referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events: episodes of "lost time" and loss of awareness. She had one episode of loss of consciousness culminating in this admission.  MEDICATIONS: gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 100 mg capsule, Take 2 capsules by mouth 3 times daily.  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (1/26/2016, 11:24 - 1/27/2016, 06:00)  MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin is stopped  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   Prominent lambda waves are seen in wakefulness.  During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was captured and normal.  No generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: not performed  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate in the 60s-80s bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is a normal long term video EEG. There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a normal awake and asleep long term EEG. No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.  Reading attending:     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (1/27/2016, 06:00 - 1/28/2016, 06:00)  MEDICATIONS: gabapentin still held  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: 1/27/2016 at 10:28 Hyperventilation is performed for 3 minutes and produces mild background slowing  1/27/2016 at 10:36 Stepped photic stimulation in intervals from 1-21 flashes per second produced bilateral symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.  Additionally, patient is sleep deprived until 1/28/2016 03:00.  EVENTS:  (1) DATE AND TIME:  1/27/2016 at 20:06 EVENT TYPE: Event of unclear etiology CLINICAL: Patient complains of feeling "hot and tingly." Nurse tests her at 20:10 and she is A&Ox3, following commands.  On rounds the next morning, the patient notes that these symptoms are not her typical habitual events. EEG: No ictal epileptic EEG correlate is present DURATION: ~8 min POSTICTAL CHANGES:  No change in cerebral rhythms EKG: unchanged HR in single EKG lead  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s-80s  DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION This is a normal awake and asleep long term EEG.  The episode of feeling "hot and tingly" had no clinical correlate; given the duration and nature of the complaint, it is unlikely to represent a seizure.   Reading attending:     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (1/28/2016, 06:00 - 1/28/2016, 13:25)  EMEDICATIONS: gabapentin still held  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s-70s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Normal EEG  Reading attending:     -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal video EEG.  The patient's typical habitual events were not captured and no conclusion can definitively be made as to whether or not they represent seizures.  One episode of feeling "hot and tingly" that lasted several minutes was captured on 1/27. Given the duration and nature of the complaint, it is unlikely to represent a seizure.   Reading attending:
