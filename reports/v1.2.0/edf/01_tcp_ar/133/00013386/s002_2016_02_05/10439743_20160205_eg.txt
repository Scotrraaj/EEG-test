History:	55 year old woman with a history of seizures.  Patient also has a history of kidney 
	disease on hemodyalisis.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the 
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, 
and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Continuous polymorphic frequently sharply contoured delta activity is present in the left anterior 
temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No clear epileptiform discharges
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse 
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left temporal, anterior
	No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and 
continuous moderate left anterior temporal focal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild 
diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is 
indicative of a focal structural lesion in  left anterior temporal region.  A repeat study with sleep
