TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



Mild-moderate generalized slowing is present.

Shifting focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:




This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1.  Sharply contoured, disorganized pattern with shifting slowing but no definitive epileptiform
features


CLINICAL CORRELATION: EEG monitoring, in an attempt to capture one of her events will follow
the study
