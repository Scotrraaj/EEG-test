SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is excess
theta noted bilaterally and a L breach rhythm.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.







Sleep is minimal characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.


Focal slowing is present.  Intermittent bursts of sharply contoured slowing are noted in drowsiness, at
T1 T3



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: see above


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Photic Stimulation: scant driving


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Background slowing and disorganization

2. Intermittent sharply contoured left tempora focal slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with structural process as described above. There
were no seizures recorded.
