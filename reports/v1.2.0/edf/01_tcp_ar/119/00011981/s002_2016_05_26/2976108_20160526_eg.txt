HISTORY:

55 y.o. male with a history of adult onset seizures, likely juvenile myoclonic
epilepsy and obstructive sleep apnea referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG , HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare (<1hour) frontally predominant spike and wave activity and polyspike activity was identified on
rare occasions.  This included a pair of spike and wave complexes, 2-3 Hz and then an isolated
polyspike and slow-wave complex of 3 Hz




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:




Hyperventilation: Did not significantly activate the record



Photic Stimulation: Did not significantly activate the record



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  Occasional premature ventricular
complexes


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. frontally predominant spike and wave/polyspike and wave discharges



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are suggestive of a generalized mechanism for epilepsy such as an inherited epilepsy
