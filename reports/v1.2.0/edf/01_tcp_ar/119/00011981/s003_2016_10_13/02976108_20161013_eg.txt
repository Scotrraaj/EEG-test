HISTORY:

55 y.o. male with a history of OSA, shift work, adult onset epilepsy, recent seizure
with fall,  referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

MEALS
TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz 40 uV posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
POSTS, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Sleep is fragmented, snore artifact is present. Slow wave
sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare bursts of frontal 3 Hz spike and wave activity or polyspike wave of <2 sec duration were noted.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation: does not activate the record

Photic Stimulation: The patient was in stage II sleep



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.






HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Brief bursts generalized spike and wave activity in early drowsiness


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are suggestive of a generalized mechanism for seizures.
