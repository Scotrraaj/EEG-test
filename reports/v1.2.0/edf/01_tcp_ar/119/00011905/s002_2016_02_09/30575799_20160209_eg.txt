HISTORY:

39 y.o. male with a history of schizophrenia,

disorganized behavior, seclusiveness, and paranoia referred for


routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.


MEDICATIONS: HYDROXYZINE,LACHYDRIN, DIPHENHYDRAMINE, PROTONIX,


METFORMIN, DEPAKOTE


SEDATION: None listed



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a


fairly well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta

frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior


dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient

of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.


During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior


dominant rhythm, and bursts of sharply contoured theta and delta

waves, with diffuse background slowing, are seen.



Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild

diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
