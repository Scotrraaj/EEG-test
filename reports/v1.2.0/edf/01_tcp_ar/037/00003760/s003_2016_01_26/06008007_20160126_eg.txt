HISTORY:

a 63 y.o. male with a history of alcohol

abuse, drug abuse, anxiety, depression, renal failure, and COPD,


presenting with possible post-traumatic seizures referred for

routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

SYMBICORT 160-4.5 mcg/actuation inhaler,


clarithromycin (BIAXIN) 250 mg tablet,

folic acid (FOLVITE) 1 mg tablet,

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet,


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet,

sertraline (ZOLOFT) 50 mg tablet,


SPIRIVA WITH HANDIHALER 18 mcg inhalation capsule,




cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12) 100 mcg Tablet, Take 1,000 mcg by

mouth daily.


pyridoxine (VITAMIN B-6) 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth

daily.


Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, (VITAMIN D) 1,000 unit Capsule, Take

by mouth.

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 325 mg tablet, Take 650 mg by mouth

every 6 hours as needed for Pain.


sodium phosphates (FLEET ENEMA) 19-7 gram/118 mL Enema, Place 1

enema rectally daily as needed.


magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) 400 mg/5 mL Suspension,

Take  by mouth daily.


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically difficult study due to near

continuous muscle artifact affecting the temporal regions.  It


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).


The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured


No generalized slowing is present.


There is frequent right temporal polymorphic slowing

There is occasional left temporal polymorphic slowing



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal, though technically limited, awake only 1 hr

EEG due to:


1. Frequent right temporal polymorphic slowing

2. Occasional left temporal polymorphic slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of bitemporal, right > left

temporal cerebral dysfunction.
