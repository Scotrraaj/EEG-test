HISTORY:

51 y.o. MAN PRESENT WITH PMHX SIG FOR SZ,

WITH PRIOR EEG. PT REPORTS LAST SZ X 2 WEEKS AGO WITH LOC




MEDICATIONS:


TEGRETOL, DILANTIN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

poorly organized symmetric mixture of tetha and delta


frequencies, 7.5 Hertz at best posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Frequent sharp waves and spikes seen mainly in the bifrontal

regions at F8, F8/T4, F4, F7, F7/T3, F3 some with large frontal

and at times posterior fields.




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Frequent sharp waves mainly in the bilateral frontal regions

with large fields and fronto -temporal regions.

2. Mild to moderate diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings of frequent sharp waves mainly in the bilateral

frontal regions indicate the presence of epileptogenic foci in

those regions and are seen in association focal epilepsy.  The

mild to moderate diffuse background slowing is an etiologically


nonspecific indicator of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
