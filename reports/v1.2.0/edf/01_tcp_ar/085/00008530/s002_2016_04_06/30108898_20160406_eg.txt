DATE OF STUDY: 04/06/2016

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 59 y.o. male with a history of AKI,

confusional state referred for routine EEG for characterization

of seizures.  Prior evaluation for neurodegenerative disorder,

spectrum of MSA early stage or AD/ consideration given the family

h/o AD, in the context of depression/known cerebellar atrophy.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


paroxetine (PAXIL) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth every

morning.

paroxetine (PAXIL) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth every


morning.

folic acid (FOLVITE) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth daily.

aripiprazole (ABILIFY) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily.


hydrOXYzine (ATARAX) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth 3 times




daily as needed.

diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth


nightly as needed.

naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth as


needed.

HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE PO, Take  by mouth.

ARIPIPRAZOLE (ABILIFY PO), Take  by mouth.

TRAZODONE HCL (TRAZODONE PO), Take  by mouth.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

verbal stimulation.  The patient is very drowsy.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present. Excess theta is noted in wakefulness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.




Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm, reg is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild excess theta.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific but can be seen in a mild

disturbance of cerebral function. Comparison to prior studies may


be of value.  Medications may play a role.

If epilepsy is an important consideration, please schedule an

outpatient EEG in the lab with HV and Photic
