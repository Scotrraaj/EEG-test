HISTORY:

77 y.o. male with a history of seizures

referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA RESTARTED SEVERAL DAYS AGO. SEROQUEL,

PREDNISOLONE, KETOROLAC DROPS, ATROPINE, VITAMINS



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha, beta, with excess


theta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7.5-8 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior


gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and further


background slowing are seen.



Sleep transients are not captured.


Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing


2. Suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of mild diffuse cerebral

dysfunction.
