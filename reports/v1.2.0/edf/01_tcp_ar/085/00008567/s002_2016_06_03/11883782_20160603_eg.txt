HISTORY:

61 y.o. WOMAN WITH CC OF UNCONTROLLED SEIZURES.  ONSET AGE 16.
???GENETIC.  PMHX: SZS, DYSLIPIDEMIA, DEPRESSION, HYPOTHYROIDISM



MEDICATIONS:


VIMPAT, DEPAKOTE, NEURONTIN, SYNTHROID, LEVOTHYROXINE, MEGESTROL


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional left and right mid-temporal sharp waves and spikes. Some with a large field.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
focal slowing in the left temporal region. Also very frequent PVC's were noted with HV.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Please note frequent PVCs are seen with
HV.


IMPRESSION:

1. Occasional left and right temporal sharp waves and spikes

2. Left anterior temporal focal slow.


3. Frequent PVCs with HV


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to sharp waves in the mid-temporal region.
This are indicative of potentially epileptogenic foci in those regions. In addition there is intermittent
focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
