START DATE OF STUDY: 08/15/16 at 11:19AM

END DATE OF STUDY: 08/21/2016 10AM



RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: 

EEG TYPE: Long term recording




HISTORY:

a 61 y.o. right handed woman admitted to  for possible surgical
evaluation for intractable localization related epilepsy since age 16 years old.




Seizure types:


Seizure type #1 Simple Partial seizures- She hears a buzzing sound for seconds. Currently none.



Seizure type #2 Complex partial seizures -She hears a buzzing sound and feels strange for seconds
then losses consciousness. The husband reported that she may then have rhythmic movements of her
hands and stare. Sometimes she may walk around for 2-3 minutes. After the event she has difficulty
speaking and confused for 15-20 minutes. She has had frequent urinary incontinence with the
seizures.




Current frequency is about 2-3/ month.




Seizure type #3 Complex partial seizures with secondary tonic clonic: As above then tonic clonic
seizure. Has bitten her tongue and had bladder incontinence. Last one on 01/07/12. Frequency 5 in
life.



Epilepsy Risk Factors: No complications during birth. Denies a family history of seizures, history of
head trauma, previous CNS infection, febrile seizures or developmental delay.


Sister with severe epilepsy since youth. Father with seizures only with alcohol abuse.



Current AEDs:


1. Depakote ER 500mg q12h.

2. Vimpat 200 mg q12h.




Prior AEDs:Gabapentin (dizziness), PHT, TPM, LEV, CBZ, OXC, LTG, VPA, LCM, ZNG. PHB caused
anxiety and could not sleep.




The interictal EEG
revealed T1/T3 and T2-T4 slowing as well as T5/P3, T6, T1, T2 sharp waves. There were 4 events
were not clearly localized one appears to have onset at T6 and a different seizure with onset at
T5/P3. One appeared to be complex partial seizure (based on the notes) and the other one with
secondary generalization.





Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Recording of seizures for presurgical evaluation.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;



- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;

- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patientÂ’s exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:






A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

INDUCTION PROCEDURES:

Sleep deprivation



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:

Interictal Findings:


F7, T3, F7/T3, T5  sharp waves. T5 polyspikes.




F8/T4, T4,  F8, T6 sharp waves



Ictal Findings:

The patient had 5 clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the
epilepsy monitoring unit.


3 right posterior temporal complex partial seizures

2 left posterior temporal complex partial seizures



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Complex partial seizures.



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Temporal lobe epilepsy arising from either posterior temporal region.



CONCLUSION:

 was admitted to the for 6 days with continuous video EEG. The
interictal EEG is characterized by bitemporal epileptiform activity .  Focal slowing in the bitemporal
regions is non-specific with regards to etiology. Frequent bilateral temporal epileptiform discharges
indicate a potentially epileptogenic foci in those regions.




The patient was weaned off Vimpat and Depakote over the course of her admission. She was
restarted on her medication on the day prior to her discharge from the hospital. No other medication
changes were made during the hospitalization.




After this data is acquired she will be presented at surgical conference to discuss the possibility of
intracranial monitoring / electrocorticography as a next step in her surgical evaluation.



Patient is follow-up with as an outpatient.
