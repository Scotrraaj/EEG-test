EEGs:10/2013 (TUH) and 1/2012 (TUH): Nl awake and asleep study







Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Recording of seizures for presurgical evaluation.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patient's exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:





A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

DAY 1 (10/18/2016, 10:11AM - 10/19/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is captured with stage I and II along deeper stages including REM/



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: HV and photic not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

EVENTS: seizure at 4:42:11 PM

Clinically, patient is awake, supine, with hands crossed, watching TV.  Except from increase in heart
rate from ~ 84 bpm (resting) to up to 114 bpm, there are no other clinical signs/ symptoms at seizure
onset.  Patient continues to lay relatively still for minutes.  ~5 minutes after electrographic seizure
onset the EEG tech enters the room and speaks to the patient.  He does not respond and looks to the
left (she is on his right side). At ~5 min 48 seconds a nurse speaks loudly to the patient and he looks
at her (she is on his right).  Despite being spoken in Spanish, at ~6.5 minutes into his seizure he
prefers to look to the left, is non-verbal, can shake his head slightly "no", cannot name, does not
follow commands accurately.  He uses his left hand to point at random objects in the room (~7
minutes into his seizure).  ~9 min 20 seconds into his seizure, he has forced head and gaze deviation
to the LEFT.  ~5 seconds later he forms figure 4 sign with LEFT arm extended.  He proceeds






to have a generalized tonic clonic convulsion for ~ 52 seconds.  Following the convulsion he is
unresponsive with heart rate in 150s.



Electrographically, first EEG change is characterized by subtle delta activity over the right temporal
region.  ~30 seconds later there is appreciable increase in heart rate from the resting 84 bpm to ~102
bpm.  Rhythmic theta activity is noted over the O2 lead ~ 80 seconds after the first EEG change.  Of
note, significant EMG artifact obscures right hemispheric leads at the same time.  There is a gradual
evolution of the activity over the right, primarily posterior temporal- temporooccipital- parietooccipital
leads.  There is eventual spread over the left occipital region and posterior central region.  At 9 min
20 sec there is diffuse EMG artifact (due to generalized tonic clonic convulsion).  Postictally, there is
diffuse slow delta activity that is attenuated.






EKG: A single EKG lead captured a regular heart rate




DAY 6 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



A single ~10 min 20 sec seizure of right temporal- posterior quadrant onset with secondary
generalization.







-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



INDUCTION PROCEDURES:

Sleep deprivation


Photic stimulation

Hyperventilation

Exercise



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:

Interictal Findings:


Normal awake and asleep


Ictal Findings:

The patient had 1 clinical event, on day #6 of monitoring.  ~10 min 20 sec focal seizure of right
temporal- posterior quadrant onset with secondary generalization.  Clinically, there is increase in
heart rate early, gaze preference to the left, expressive aphasia, confusion.





SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:


1. Complex partial seizures with secondary generalization


EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:


1. Localization related epilepsy, right temporal - posterior quadrant onset


CONCLUSION:


was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 6 days with continuous
video EEG.  This was a productive EMU monitoring session because of a single typical seizure was
captured



The interictal EEG is normal.




The patient was weaned off his AEDs (anti-epileptic medications) over the course of her admission.
S/he was restarted on his/her medication on the day prior to his/her discharge from the hospital. No
other medication changes were made during the hospitalization.




Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
