DATE OF STUDY: 09/14/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

 a 48 y.o. female with a history of focal epilepsy vs nonepileptic behavioral
events, and headaches, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

famotidine (PEPCID) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

budesonide-formoterol (SYMBICORT) 80-4.5 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs 2
times daily.


Leg Brace (KNEE BRACE) Misc, Hinge brace for left kneeDx: (M17.12) Primary osteoarthritis of left
knee

multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs
every 6 hours as needed for Wheezing.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11-11.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



This is a normal awake and asleep 1 hr and 1 min EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic
events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 1 hour and 1 min EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
