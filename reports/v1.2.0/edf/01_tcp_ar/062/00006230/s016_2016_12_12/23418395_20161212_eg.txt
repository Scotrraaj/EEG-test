SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized mixture of alpha and
theta frequencies, with a reactive 8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). Excessive 5-7Hz activity is
seen diffusely.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral frontal, temporal and occipital
regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Abundant sharp waves seen at O2 much more than O1 (see photic stimulation), frequent at Fp1 and
Fp2 with occasional one at F8, T4 and rare at F7 .



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:






Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is attempted but pt did no follow commands.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation at 3 and 5 flashes per second (fps) produced 3 and 5
Hz O2 rhythmic and synchronized sharp waves. At the rest of the frequencies 1-21hz no clear
response was noted.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Multifocal sharp waves and slow waves in the occipital, temporal and frontal regions.

2. Mild diffuse slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a very abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to multifocal sharp waves and slow
waves in the occipital, temporal and frontal regions. This is indicative of multifocal cerebral
dysfunction and irritability, which may be seen in multifocal epilepsy. The occipital response two
photic stimulation is of unclear significance but may suggest a lower threshold to occipital seizures
with photic stimulation. Lastly there was mild diffuse background slowing, which is indicative of mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction. These findings are similar to the previous routine EEG in 08/28/2013.
