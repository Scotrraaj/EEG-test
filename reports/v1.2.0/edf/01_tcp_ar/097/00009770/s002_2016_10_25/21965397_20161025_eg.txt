TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:






The waking background is asymmetric.  The left hemisphere is slightly disorganized but with a
posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz, normal anterior-posterior gradient.  The right hemisphere
demonstrates a posterior dominant rhythm, when present of 9 Hz but with continuous, somewhat
arrhythmic delta activity noted in the right frontocentral frontal temporal regions with disruption of
faster frequency activity.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous sleep spindles and few K-
complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.  Continuous focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: No driving response was noted, the patient
seemed to be drifting off to sleep



EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION: Abnormal due to


1. Continuous right frontocentral focal slowing

2.  Mild disorganization on the left



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is routine  1 hour EEG is consistent with a structural process on the right involving gray and white
matter.  No epileptiform features were noted at this time
