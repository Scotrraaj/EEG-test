No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic up to 8.5

Hz low amplitude alpha activity, weak AP gradient and excess of


polymorphic theta activity.



Patient is drowsy throughout most of the recording.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured



Continuous polymorphic slow at times sharply contoured delta

activity is seen over the right temporal region.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No clear epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional

abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


An irregular heart rate and morphologically variable QRS

complexes are captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


Mild diffuse slowing

Continuous moderate right temporal slowing


Cardiac arrhythmia

No stage II sleep


No epileptiform discharges


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal briefly awake and mostly drowsy EEG due to


mild diffuse slowing and continuous moderate right temporal focal

slowing.


Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse

cerebral dysfunction. Continuous focal slowing indicates focal

structural cerebral abnormality.



An irregular heart rate and morphologically variable QRS

complexes are captured on a single EKG lead.
