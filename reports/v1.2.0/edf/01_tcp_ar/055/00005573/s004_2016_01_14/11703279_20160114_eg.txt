SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


Bedside portable 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, no HV


nor photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is a bit slow but  symmetric, reactive, and


consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal

beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior


gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and

reactive 7-9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which


attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  There is excess theta

in wakefulness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and an increase

in shifting slowing and  background slowing are seen.






Sleep is not sustained

Generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 80 bpm  Irregular is captured on a single EKG

lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal bedside portable routine EEG:

1. Background slowing and disorganization  There are no clinical


or electrographic events reported or detected.

2. Shifting slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is the 5th EEG for this patient without epileptiform


features .

This routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.
