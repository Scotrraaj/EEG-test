HISTORY:

49 y.o. male with a history of agenesis of corpus callosum, Dandy Walker
abnormality, currently seizure free, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 1 hour   Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.7 Hertz 50 uV  posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: no significant driving



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  A recent 2013 EEG was also normal.



A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
