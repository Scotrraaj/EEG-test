DATE OF STUDY: 06/29/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 60 min - 3 hr, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 74 y.o. male with a history of cerebrovascular disease and epilepsy.  Previously
seizure-free.  Sister suggests that he may have had a seizure referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


epoetin alfa (PROCRIT) 4,000 unit/mL injection, Inject 1 mL into the skin every 7 days. For 6 doses
only.
atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

metolazone (ZAROXOLYN) 5 mg tablet, Take 0.5 tablets by mouth daily.


allopurinol (ZYLOPRIM) 300 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

colchicine (COLCRYS) 0.6 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every other day.

furosemide (LASIX) 80 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH TWICE A DAY FOR
HYPERTENSION

amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

cloNIDine (CATAPRES) 0.2 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY 8 HOURS FOR
HYPERTENSION
clopidogrel (PLAVIX) 75 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH DAILY




acetaminophen-codeine (TYLENOL-CODEINE #3) 300-30 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth
every 6 hours as needed for Pain.


timolol (TIMOPTIC) 0.5 % ophthalmic solution, Place 1 drop into both eyes 2 times daily.

zonisamide (ZONEGRAN) 100 mg capsule, Take 2 capsules by mouth nightly.


latanoprost (XALATAN) 0.005 % ophthalmic solution, Place 1 drop into both eyes nightly.

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 100 mg tablet, TAKE 1 AND 1/2 TABS TWICE DAILY



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International
10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically
satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG  and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.3 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Maximal
wakefulness on the whole is relatively symmetric




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  Focal slowing is noted in drowsiness
with dropout of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere compared to the left




Sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles.  Stage II sleep also includes some focality and
sleep morphologies are better developed on the left



Mild generalized slowing is present.

In drowsiness and sleep focal slowing is present on the right



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Photic Stimulation: Driving responses elicited, better on the left



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1.  Focal slowing in the right hemisphere noted in drowsiness and sleep



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



No epileptiform features were identified.  These study may be compared to previous studies,
particularly in view of the patient's cerebrovascular disease.




Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
