SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.


The background consists of a mixture of low amplitude polymorphic theta and alpha activity with
underriding delta activity.




Continuous polymorphic sharply contoured theta and delta activity is present over the left anterior
quadrant.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



This is an abnormal routine EEG in a comatose patient due to:

1. Mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing


2. Moderate focal left anterior quadrant slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.



Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the left anterior quadrant and is
consistent with a history of a prior left sided craniotomy.



The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
