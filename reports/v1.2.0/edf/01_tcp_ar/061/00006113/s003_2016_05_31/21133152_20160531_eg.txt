HISTORY:

51 y.o. female with a history of possible localization related epilepsy arising
from the temporal lobes based on semiology vs ADPEAF referred for routine EEG for characterization
of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 6
hours as needed for Pain.

alprazolam (XANAX) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily as needed.


OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 150 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

mirtazapine (REMERON) 15 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly. Indications: MAJOR
DEPRESSIVE DISORDER


potassium chloride (K-DUR,KLOR-CON) 20 mEq tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.


lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.





ondansetron (ZOFRAN, AS HYDROCHLORIDE,) 4 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily as needed
for Nausea.


amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 800 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily.


cyproheptadine (PERIACTIN) 4 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily as needed.

ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet, Take 325 mg by mouth daily (with breakfast).



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:




There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only 1-hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake only 1-hour EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
