HISTORY: 57 y.o. male with a history of right temporal lobe hemorrhage and resultant focal epilepsy, noncompliant with home AEDs (reportedly taking Keppra 1000 mg daily instead of q12h), presenting with multiple convulsions and intubated, referred for routine EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.  Stat bedside EEG requested as patient was quite aggressive and having intermittent desaturation.  MEDICATIONS: Keppra 1500 mg q12h - stopped, loaded with depakote 20 mg/kg x2 Ativan Versed  SEDATION: as above, initially on propofol drip  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/8/2016, 14:32 - 11/9/2016, 06:00)  *leads disconnected 11/8 19:50-19:55, 21:01-21:15, 22:30-22:54. All leads off and only R leads re-attached 23:01-05:25. By 11/9 05:25 all leads back on.  EEG BACKGROUND, EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY, EVENTS: The record opens to a symmetric but disorganized mix of predominantly alpha and beta with admixed theta. There is no clear reactivity.  There are continuous left fronto-temporal (F7 max) sharp waves, often reflecting over the right temporal region, periodic at 1 Hz (lateralized periodic discharges, LPDs). These frequently dissolve into semi-rhythmic theta with admixed fast frequencies without definite evolution, for up to 13 sec at a time. Occasionally these evolve into electrographic seizures.  There is no associated clinical correlation.  There are very frequent additional runs of semi-rhythmic right fronto-temporal (F8/T4 max) sharply contoured theta with admixed faster frequencies, for up to 30 seconds, at times evolving into electrographic seizures.  As the evening progresses, a cluster of right temporal electrographic seizures occurs: 11/8 at 20:23, 20:47, 21:19, 21:31, 21:40, 21:48, 22:10, 22:14, 23:22, 23:27, 23:36 11/9 at 01:04, 01:45, 02:09, 02:22 Duration: 30-90 sec Clinical: no clinical manifestation EEG: theta activity (sometimes with, sometimes without admixed spikes) over right fronto-temporal region (F8 max) organizes into 4 Hz, then 3 Hz, then 2 Hz spike-wave before offset. As night progresses seizures evolve less clearly. EKG: no change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 100s-110s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to:  1. Severe generalized slowing, disorganization, with lack of clear reactivity 2. Continuous left temporal periodic discharges, occasionally evolving into left temporal electrographic seizures 3. Very frequent right temporal runs of semi rhythmic theta 4. Cluster of clearly evolving right fronto-temporal (F8 max) seizures, last noted 11/9 02:22   These findings are diagnostic for bi-temporal independent epilepsy with ongoing electrographic seizures of both independent left and right temporal origin.  There is additional evidence for severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may at least in part be related to sedating medications.  These findings were communicated to the treating team and medication adjustments were made.   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (11/9/2016, 06:00 - 11/10/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: Quieter periods consist of delta with attenuated faster frequencies. Reactivity is demonstrated by return of faster frequencies during periods of relative wakefulness.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: moderate-severe  FOCAL SLOWING: continuous bi-temporal polymorphic/semi-rhythmic slowing  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Bilateral independent periodic discharges slowly resolve There are frequent left fronto-temporal (F7 max) sharp waves  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 100s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Improvement in degree of background as reactivity is demonstrated. No definitely evolving electrographic seizures. Bitemporal independent highly epileptogenic discharges slowly resolve. Left fronto-temporal epileptogenic potentials persist.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (11/10/2016, 06:00 - 11/10/2016, 09:56)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: There are frequent left fronto-temporal (F7 max) sharp waves  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s-70s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Background remains unchanged compared with end of day 2   -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Severe generalized slowing which improves to moderate-severe by day 2 2. Continuous left temporal periodic discharges, occasionally evolving into left temporal electrographic seizures, which resolve by day 2 3. Very frequent right temporal runs of semi rhythmic theta 4. Cluster of clearly evolving right fronto-temporal (F8 max) seizures, which resolve by day 2   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are diagnostic for bi-temporal independent epilepsy of both independent left and right temporal origin. There is additional evidence for diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may at least in part be related to sedating medications, and improves to moderate-severe by day 2.
