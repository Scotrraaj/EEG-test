TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically very challenging
record with significant electrode artifact and included a single channel of EKG and photic
stimulation.

EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: not performed



Photic Stimulation: Scant driving response


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead when awake. HR increases to 90 during
sleep.


IMPRESSION:

This is a technically challenging but normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or
electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  The patient seems very sleepy


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
