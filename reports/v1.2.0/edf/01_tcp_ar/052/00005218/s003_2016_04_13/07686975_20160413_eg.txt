SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior


dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye

opening. PDR is higher in amplitude over the sagittal leads.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Subtle fast activity and occasional polymorphic theta activity


(primarily during sleep) is noted over the right midtemporal

region.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

Focal slowing - occasional - mild - right midtemporal


Breach - subtle - right midtemporal



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep 30 minute EEG due to subtle


occasional mild right midtemporal focal slowing.

This finding is suggestive of etiologically non-specific focal

cerebral dysfunction.

Breach effect is secondary to the skull defect.
