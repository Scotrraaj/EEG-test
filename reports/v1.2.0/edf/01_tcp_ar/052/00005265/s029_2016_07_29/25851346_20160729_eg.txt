HISTORY: 27 y.o. male with a history of refractory epilepsy and reported nonepileptic behavioral events referred for EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.  MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital 130 q12h (level: 29) Lacosamide 200 mg q12h Keppra 2000 mg q12h Klonopin 1 mg q12h  SEDATION: as above  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (7/29/2016, 16:51 - 7/30/2016, 06:00)  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by disorganized sharply contoured theta and excess beta and delta, the latter which is frontally predominant. There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm.  Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by further background slowing, with increased prevalence of rhythmic delta activity. Rare rudimentary K complexes and sleep spindles are noted.  Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present. No persistent focal slowing is seen.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: The sharply contoured background with excess beta makes distinguishing true epileptiform potentials difficult.  1. Occasional spikes are noted over the bi-occipital regions (O1/O2 max, shifting predominance) 2. Occasional bi-fronto-central spike-and wave (Fp1/Fp2/Cz/Fz max), activated by sleep 3. At times frontal delta becomes quasi-rhythmic and notched in runs of 2.5 Hz. There is no definite evolution and no definite clinical change associated with this pattern.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: Multiple clinical episodes are captured (duration < 1 min): 7/29/2016 at 18:46, 18:55, 18:57, 19:02, 19:04, 19:07, 19:10, 19:13, 19:16, 19:20, 19:22, 19:24, 19:28, 19:31, 19:35, 19:38, 19:40, 19:43, 19:46, 19:49, 19:53, 19:55, 19:58, 20:00, 20:03, 20:09 CLINICAL: right head deviation, left arm elevation, followed by twitching of face/left arm and rapid blinking, with decreased responsiveness. Little/no postictal period. EEG: background develops into high amplitude 2 Hz delta. There is superimposed twitch artifact. No electrographic evolution. No postictal change. These episodes resolve with administration of Ativan at 20:10.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.   DAY 1 IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and disorganization 2. Occasional spikes noted over the bi-occipital regions (O1/O2 max, shifting predominance) 3. Occasional bi-fronto-central spike-and wave (Fp1/Fp2/Cz/Fz max), activated by sleep 4. Runs of notched frontal delta, quasi rhythmic at 2.5 Hz without clear evolution. 5. Multiple episodes as above which are stereotyped and associated with change in EEG pattern. Though there is no definite evolution, their stereotyped nature and association with EEG changes makes them very likely to be seizures.  DAY 1 CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, with diffuse epileptogenic potential and at least two foci (bi-occipital, bi-fronto-central) of epileptogenic potential. The episodes described above are most likely seizures and resolve with administration of Ativan.  Excess beta may be seen in the setting of a medication effect (benzodiazepines, barbiturates).  Note that background findings appear similar in nature to those on LTM in 4/2016. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (7/30/2016, 06:00 - 7/31/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: as on day 1, with fewer bursts of rhythmic delta  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (7/31/2016, 06:00 - 7/31/2016, 08:30)  BACKGROUND: No change from day 2  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Unchanged from day 2 No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and disorganization 2. Occasional spikes noted over the bi-occipital regions (O1/O2 max, shifting predominance) 3. Occasional bi-fronto-central spike-and wave (Fp1/Fp2/Cz/Fz max), activated by sleep 4. Runs of notched frontal delta, quasi rhythmic at 2.5 Hz without clear evolution. 5. Multiple episodes captured on 7/29 (day 1) between 18:46-20:09, which are stereotyped and associated with change in EEG pattern. Though there is no definite evolution, their stereotyped nature and association with EEG changes makes them very likely to be seizures.   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, with diffuse epileptogenic potential and at least two foci (bi-occipital, bi-fronto-central) of epileptogenic potential. The episodes described on day 1 are most likely seizures and resolve with administration of Ativan. Following Ativan, no clinical or electrographic events were captured for the remainder of the study.  Excess beta may be seen in the setting of a medication effect (benzodiazepines, barbiturates).  Note that background findings appear similar in nature to those on LTM in 4/2016.
