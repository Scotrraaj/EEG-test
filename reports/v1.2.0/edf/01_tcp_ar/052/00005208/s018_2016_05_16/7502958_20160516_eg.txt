DATE OF STUDY: 05/16/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 55 YR OLD WOMAN PRESENTS FOR FOLLOW UP EEG, S/P IMPLANT SURGERY.
LAST SZ X 1 WEEK AGO




MEDICATIONS:


TRILEPTAL, NEURONTIN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



FOCAL FEATURES:


Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. There is an associated increase in amplitude over this
region consistent with a breach rhythm.




Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.






IMPRESSION:

1. Continuous focal slow waves in the left anterior temporal region with an associated breach


2. Intermittent  focal slow waves in the right anterior temporal region




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing and breach in
the left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of structural focal cerebral dysfunction in
this region, consistent with the known surgery. In addition there is intermittent focal slowing in the
right anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
