HISTORY:

This is a 55 y.o. ambidextrous female admitted for intracranial


(iEEG) monitoring with intracranial electrodes with a history of:

treatment resistant epilepsy.




Intracranial video electroencephalography with intracranial

electrodes was performed to: lateralize and localize the ictal

onset zone




CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

Continuous video-electroencephalogram (VEEG) was recorded


utilizing the NicOne System (Natus). A maximum of 128




simultaneous channels of intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG)

was sampled at 512 Hertz utilizing the C64 system amplifiers


(A/D=22 bit, CMRR>110 dB).  Clinical events were marked on the

EEG record via an event button controlled by the patient, family


or clinical team.  All clinical events as well as extensive

random background samples including wakefulness, drowsiness, and

sleep were reviewed.  Digital analysis of the EEG was performed

utilizing the NicOne automatic spike and seizure detection.



Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and


computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG

activity and correlation with behavior.  The patient was attended

by an EEG technician and/or nursing aide 24 hours a day.  A

neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.


The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a

registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and


testing.  During times when a technician was not available, EEG

recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and

nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.




MEDICATIONS:


OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 300 mg tablet, 2 tabs in am and 3 tabs

in pm [given 11/30/2015, but patient later admitted to taking 2

tabs twice daily at home]



SEDATION: None

SEIZURES/EVENTS:

(1) DATE AND TIME:   12/7/2015 at 13:40

EVENT TYPE: Event of unclear etiology


CLINICAL: The tech finishes photic stimulation and asks patient

to open her eyes.  She is slow to follow commands and does not


respond when asked if she is ok or where she is.  About a minute

into the event she has a brief nonforced head turn to the left

(may be voluntary).  She then follows commands sluggishly.  She

does not answer questions but follows simple commands.  She


symmetrically holds her arms out.  She can remember a word.

EEG: No ictal epileptic EEG correlate is present


DURATION: unclear

POSTICTAL CHANGES:  none

EKG: no change in heart rate is seen on a single EKG lead



(2) DATE AND TIME:   12/7/2015 at 21:32

EVENT TYPE: Focal seizure (out of sleep), L mesial temporal,


likely impairment of consciousness

CLINICAL: The patient is off camera for the entire event. Only


ambient noise can be heard. However, eyeblink artifact is noted

starting 17 seconds into electrographic onset. Possible brief


guttoral noises are heard 20 sec into event, then again at 32

sec, 46 sec, then 90 sec, 190 sec. Some soft, brief moans are


also heard postictally.

On rounds next morning patient reports she was unaware of

episode.

EEG: There is a herald spike at LHH 1-4, followed by gamma


activity at LHH 1-4, seen <200 msec later in LHB 1-4. This

activity continues for 2.5 seconds before slowing to delta for <1


second. Then, there is onset of low amplitude 15 Hz activity seen

best in LHB 3-4, then LHB 1-2, that increases in frequency and

decreases in amplitude, spreading to LHH 1-4. This activity in

LHB develops admixed spikes in LHB 3-4, then LHB 1-2. This has


occurred about 10 seconds into electrographic onset. It is at

this time that a low amplitude gamma buzz is seen over Fp1-F7 and


Fp1-F3 on scalp leads, followed by F3-C3-P3,  F7-T1-T3-T5, then

T4-T6-O2. By 10 seconds into electrographic onset there is onset

of gamma activity over LOF 9-10, by 13 seconds gamma activity is

seen over ROF 5-6. By 16 seconds there is onset of gamma activity


over LAM 1-2. Ictal activity in the aforementioned leads evolves,

becoming increasingly rhythmic and slowing to spikey alpha,


except in LHB 1-4, where there are 3 Hz polyspikes.  By 24

seconds there is rhythmic alpha seen in RHB 9-10; by 28 seconds

rhythmic spikey alpha develops in LTP 1-4. Ictal activity

increases in amplitude, developing distinct spikes, and slows in


frequency to delta-theta range: at this point, LOF 1-4, LAM 1-2,

LHH 1-4, LHB 1-4, LTP 1-6, and (to a lesser extent) RHB 9-10 are


involved. By 162 seconds, LOF stops spiking; LAM 5-8, LHH 3-8,

LTP 1-8 continue spiking. This continues, with intermittent

nonevolving gamma buzzes in LOF 9-10, until seizure offset (426

seconds total).


DURATION: 7 min 6 sec

POSTICTAL CHANGES:  Attenuation noted most prominently over LAM


1-8, LHH 1-8, LTP 1-8, also LOF 1-8 and LHB 1-8 to a lesser

extent.


EKG: baseline HR: 60 bpm, ictal HR up to 96 bpm, postictal HR 72

bpm

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


SEIZURES/EVENTS:


(1) DATE AND TIME:   12/8/2015 at 21:08

EVENT TYPE: Focal seizure


CLINICAL: patient asleep in bed. At 15 sec into electrographic

onset, opens eyes and slightly shifts body, grunts Intermittently

for about 52 seconds. Has slight movements of left hand under the

covers at 60 seconds. Continues to grunt intermittently and have


intermittent movements of left arm under the covers.  At 118

seconds has nonforced head turn towards right (possibly attending


to a noise), then left (appears to attend to a phone ringing).

Shifts left leg slightly at 212 sec. At 216 seconds, staff


enters. Patient responds she is

location; she is oriented to self and follows a simple command to


raise left hand. She then slowly responds she is in a hospital,

but does not know name. At this point electrographic seizure has


ended.

EEG: There is a herald spike at LHH 1-4 and within 200 msec at

LHB 1-4.  These are followed by gamma activity at LHH 1-4 and LHB

1-4. This activity continues for 4.4 seconds before attenuating


and then re-emerging as a gamma buzz over the same region.  Gamma

buzz spreads to LOF 1-4, then LOF 9-10, then ROF 5-6, then LAM


1-2 within 18 seconds.  By 13 seconds a change in the surface EEG

electrodes is noted, with gamma buzz seen diffusely.  Ictal

activity in the aforementioned leads evolves in frequency and

morphology: there is onset of rhythmic alpha frequency spiking


over LHB 1-4 that slows to theta frequency spiking, and gamma

activity over LAM 1-2 slows to rhythmic spiking theta.  By 20


seconds, ictal activity has spread to involve LOF 1-2, LAM 1-8,

LHH 1-4, LHB 1-4, LTP 1-10, ROF 5-6; by 22 seconds scalp activity

is seen to evolve best over the left hemisphere.  Ictal activity

in aforementioned leads increases in amplitude, slows in


frequency, and develops a definite spiky morphology.  By 118

seconds LOF leads cease firing but LAM 5-8, LHH 3-8, LTP 1-10


continue spiking. This activity continues until seizure end.

DURATION: 5 min 6 sec

POSTICTAL CHANGES: slowing and attenuation over LOF, LAM, LHH,

LHB, LTP


EKG: baseline HR 60 bpm, ictal HR 90 bpm, postictal HR 60 bpm

EVENT TYPE: Focal seizure

CLINICAL: Patient is lying in bed and shifts body position at


onset. Chewing movements are noted. She appears mildly

tachypneic. 52 seconds into electrographic onset nurse comes in


and turns on lights. Asks pt if she is ok and attempts to push

button (it is not working). Asks patient the code word - patient

does not respond. Asks patient name and where she is - patient

does not respond. Asks patient to name an object - response


inaudible. Nurse blocks view of patient on camera. Asks patient

to touch nose, then right ear - cannot see patient on screen.


Asks patient to take the pen - cannot see response. Tech notes

patient is able to raise arms and legs. Patient still cannot

answer code word. Cannot see patient or hear her responses on

video review. At 10:08:30 nurse moves. Patient seen to follow


simple commands to hold up arms and legs. She is able to shift

position purposefully in bed. She still cannot remember code


word. She continues to have oral automatisms. After seizure ends

patient is immediately able to state her first name and continues


to follow simple commands. However she cannot name a pen.

EEG: herald spike LHH 1-4, LHB 1-4, followed within 100 msec by


LTP 1-10. High frequency spiking develops over LHH 1-4, LHB 1-4,

becoming rhythmic beta, then higher amplitude rhythmic alpha,


then developing admixed spikes. By 12 sec there is spread to LAM

1-2, by 13 sec to LOF 1-4, then LOF 5-8. By 18 sec all left depth

electrodes become attenuated except LHH 1-4, LHB 1-4, and LAM 1-2

which continue with spikey beta. By 32 sec there is onset of


increasing amplitude spikey theta that eventually spreads to all

left depth electrodes. Ictal activity continues in LOF 1-10, LAM


5-8, LHH 1-4, LHB 1-4 after other areas have ceased firing, then

LAM 5-6 continues firing after the aforementioned electrodes

cease.

EKG: baseline HR 72 bpm, ictal HR 114, postictal HR 90


(3) DATE AND TIME:   12/11/2015 at 05:16

EVENT TYPE: focal seizure, left mesial temporal temporal, out of


sleep

CLINICAL: patient is sleeping in bed. 32 seconds into ictal onset


staff enters room and calls her name. She arouses, opens eyes,

raises right hand. Says her name nad that she is in the hospital.

She is asked to remember a code word. She names a pen and eye

glasses. She follows a command to touch nose and wave hello on


both hands and take a pen. She remembers the code word, and can

again state her name nad location. She can name a flashlight and


touch her nose and right ear and squeeze fingers with both hands.

She holds her arms up and can raise both legs. She still

remembers the code word. She is oriented to day and year.

EEG: similar to prior - herald spike LHH 1-4 as well as LAM 1-4,


followed by herald spike < 200 msec later in LHB 1-4, then onset

of spiking LHH 1-4, LHB 1-4. Ictal activity remains localized to


these electrodes for at least 20 sec, after which it spreads

throughout all depth contacts on the left. Ictal activity

continues as 3 Hz spikes in LHH 1-4, LHB 1-4 after it has ceased

elsewhere.   On scalp leads, ictal onset more subtle, with


development of rhythmic theta then delta most prominently over

left temporal chain.


DURATION: 2 min 30 sec

POSTICTAL CHANGES:  Slowing and attenuation most prominently seen


over LAM 1-6, LHH 1-6, LHB 1-6, LTP 1-10.

the commode and stands in place. Aide sits her back down and

says, "you're having another seizure." Dr. enters and


calls patient's name - patient attends. She answers her name,

location, and names objects as the seizure is ending. She follows


commands. She counts and moves all her limbs. She cannot remember

asked. She answers her name. She cannot remember the code word.

She knows she's at Temple and can follow commands. Even after


being reminded, she could not remember the code word several

seconds later. She does remember the code word after seizure


offset. However, when asked again the postictal state, she cannot

remember the code word (48 sec after offset), even though she is

no longer seizing.

SEIZURES/EVENTS:


(1) DATE AND TIME:   12/12/2015 at 08:33

EVENT TYPE: focal seizure, left mesial temporal, out of

wakefulness

CLINICAL: the patient is awake, eating her breakfast in bed.


There is no obvious clinical change in her behavior (which

includes chewing).  At electrographic seizure offset (34 sec),


PCA arrives and asks if she is ok. She attends to PCA but unclear

if she responds. PCA calls nurse. Patient answers code word,


name, names objects, and follows commands.

EEG: similar to prior seizures, with herald spike LHB 1-4, LHH


1-4, and spread of ictal activity to LOF 3-4 by 6 seconds,

followed  By LOF 1-10, LAM 1-8, LHH 1-8, LHB 1-8, LTP 1-10. Scalp


onset limited by chewing artifact, but rhythmic theta over left

hemisphere appears by 13 seconds.

CLINICAL: nurse pushes button because patient cannot remember the

code word. She eventually remembers it.


EEG: no change



(3) DATE AND TIME:   12/12/2015 at 20:50

EVENT TYPE: focal seizure with impairment of consciousness, left

mesial temporal, out of wakefulness

slightly at 20 sec. Otherwise there is no obvious clinical

change. At 32 seconds staff arrives and asks if she is ok.


Patient turns towards staff but does not respond. Electrographic

seizure ends. There is no behavioral change. Postictally she is

able to name but not oriented to place. She cannot remember the

code word. She can follow commands.


EEG: similar to prior seizures, with herald spike and slow wave

*Scalp leads are disconnected on this day at 12:09.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

As above



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




SEIZURES/EVENTS:

(1) DATE AND TIME:   12/14/2015 at 02:35


EVENT TYPE: focal seizure, left mesial temporal

CLINICAL: patient asleep in bed. There is no obvious clinical


change. At 02:36 someone pushes event button, but seizure has

already ended and patient is not tested. She rouses as the event

button is being pushed.

EEG: similar to prior seizures - herald spike LHH 1-4, LHB 1-4,


with attenuation over these leads followed by 15 Hz spiking in

these leads, with spread as previously described


DURATION: 37 sec

POSTICTAL CHANGES:  As above

EKG: not connected







-----------------------------------------------------------------

IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal intracranial EEG due to:



1. Intermittent excess theta activity in wakefulness.


2. Frequent polymorphic slowing over the left temporal region

seen on scalp EEG; correlating with delta slowing over LAM 7-8,

LTP 5-8 on intracranial EEG

3. Frequent independent polymorphic slowing over the right


temporal region seen on scalp EEG; correlating with delta slowing

over ROF 5-6 + 9-10, RAM 5-8; RHB 3-4 + 11-12 on intracranial EEG



4. Interictal epileptiform activity over the left orbitofrontal


region (LOF 1-4, LOF 5-6, LOF 7-8 spikes)

5. Interictal epileptiform activity over the left mesial temporal


region (LAM, LHH, LHB, LTP spikes)

*Note that left orbitofrontal and left mesial temporal spikes are


noted to occur both synchronously and independently.


6. Interictal epileptiform activity over the right orbitofrontal

region (ROF 3-4, 5-6, 9-10, or broadly over ROF 1-10,


spike-and-wave). At times these appear in bursts, fluctuating

between 2-8 Hz but without definite evolution.


7. Interictal epileptiform activity over the right mesial

temporal region (RAM 1-2, 3-4 (at times extending to RAM 7-8),

RHH 1-2, RHB 1-2, 3-4 (at times extending to RHB 7-8), RTP 1-2,

3-4


*Note that right orbitofrontal and right mesial temporal spikes

are noted to occur both synchronously and independently.



8. On scalp EEG within first week of implantation, occasional

bifrontal (Fp1, F3, F7, Fp2, F4, F8) spike-and-wave discharges at

2.5-3 Hz for runs <3 seconds. Of note, these are seen on


intracranial leads as rhythmic slowing in LAM 7-8, RHB 9-10, and

to a lesser extent, ROF 5-6.



9. Eighteen (18) focal seizures of left mesial temporal origin

(herald spike at left hippocampal head, LHH 1-4; and

simultaneously/very soon after at left hippocampal body, LHB


1-4), at least half of which involve impairment of

consciousness/memory, but many of which do not clearly impair


consciousness/memory.


10. Multiple (7) episodes involving confusion, anxiety, "mouth

feeling funny/tingly," anticipation of a seizure, slowness to


respond, and poor memory that lack both scalp EEG and

intracranial EEG correlate and are unlikely to represent seizure


activity.




Lateralization/Localization:



LATERALIZATION:


Interictal: Bilateral independent

Ictal: Left

LOCALIZATION:

Interictal: orbitofrontal and mesial temporal


Ictal: mesial temporal




Conclusions:


These findings are diagnostic for focal epilepsy of left mesial


temporal origin.

Epileptogenic potential was additionally noted over the left


orbitofrontal, right orbitofrontal, and right mesial temporal

region; however, there were no seizures captured over these

regions.

There is evidence for cerebral dysfunction over the bilateral


temporal regions, as well as mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.



The results of the study were discussed with the patients

primary epileptologist and neurosurgeon. Based on the results,

the patient returned to the operating room on 12/14/2015 for

removal of depth electrodes.
