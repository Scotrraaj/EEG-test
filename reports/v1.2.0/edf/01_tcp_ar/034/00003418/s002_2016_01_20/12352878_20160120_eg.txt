History:	22 year old man with a history of seizures.  Last seizure occurred ~ 7 years ago.  He 
	had another recent prolonged nocturnal seizure.
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During  drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves 
appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent brief bursts (0.3-1 seconds) of generalized frontally-maximal 
spike-and-wave discharges and polyspike-and-slow-wave discharges occur with a regular repetition 
rate of ~3.5-4 Hz.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse 
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does 
not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
	Spike-and-wave complexes, fast, frequent, 3.5-4 Hz
	No stage 2 sleep
	Secondary bilateral synchrony
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute awake and drowsy EEG due to frequent 3.5-4 Hz generalized 
spike and wave discharges. This pattern is suggestive of idiopatic generalized epilepsy.  However, 
this EEG pattern could also be seen in secondary bifrontal synchrony.  Please correlate clinically.
