HISTORY:

41 y.o. female with a history of  childhood brain tumor, subsequent

TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically   satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  She is noted to be
microcephalic with craniotomy defect




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, high amplitude
present bilaterally and reactive.  In the left posterior quadrant, there is a little bit of underlying
arrhythmic slowing.  The overall background is slightly disorganized.  Modest diffuse theta can be
identified and there is scant frontocentral beta



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  In drowsiness, left frontotemporal
slowing emerges



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes.  Sleep is quite symmetric Slow wave sleep was not captured.



mild generalized slowing is present.


Subtle focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Accentuates the underlying slowing on the left, does produce bilateral rhythmic
slowing

Photic Stimulation: Bilateral driving is present but is much more vigorous on the right




EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1.  Subtle focal features in the left hemisphere including focal slowing and an asymmetric photic
driving response


2.  Mild disorganized background

CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings may be correlated with imaging findings.  There were no epileptiform features
identified in the record today.
