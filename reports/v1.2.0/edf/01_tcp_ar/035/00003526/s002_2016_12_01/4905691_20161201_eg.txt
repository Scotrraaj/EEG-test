TECHNIQUE:

A  40 minute Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized  mixture of theta alpha
and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.3 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The
normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is prominent
breach rhythm noted with an increase in amplitude of alpha, theta and beta frequency activity on the
right particularly in the temporal region.  There is also a little bit of slowing of the alpha rhythm on
the right noted earlier and drowsiness in comparison to the left





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Subtle focal slowing is present.  The breach rhythm is more prominent than focal slowing



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Mu



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.





EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep 40 minute EEG due to:

1.  Mild slowing of the background


2.  Subtle focal slowing in the right temporal region


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



The focal slowing is an anticipated finding following right temporal resection.  Breach rhythm is also
common following craniotomy.  No epileptiform features were noted.  The mild generalized
background slowing may be correlated with clinical history and medications
