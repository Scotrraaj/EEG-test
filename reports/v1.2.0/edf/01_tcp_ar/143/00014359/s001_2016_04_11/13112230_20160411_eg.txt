HISTORY:

58 y.o. MAN S/P V FIB ARREST 3/29. PT WITH CC

OF CONFUSION.  PMHX: TRAUMATIC VSD, COPD, HEP C, , CHF,


CIRROHSIS.


MEDICATIONS:


No AEDs




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.  Excessive theta in wakefulness is noted.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to excessive


theta in wakefulness.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral


dysfunction, which is non specific with regards to etiology.
