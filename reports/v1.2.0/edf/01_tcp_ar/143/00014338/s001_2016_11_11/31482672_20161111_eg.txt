SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


Wakefulness is characterized by symmetric and reactive 40-60 uV 9-10 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Low-voltage symmetric frontocentral
beta activity is also seen. Moderate amounts of muscle artifact are noted.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by increased irregular delta and theta frequency slowing and vertex waves,






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 64 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
