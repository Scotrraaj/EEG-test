DATE OF STUDY: 01/17/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy



HISTORY:

a 44 y.o. female with a history of seizures a few years ago (resolved after started on
Depakote) referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures, after she had 1 seizure a few days
ago.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 800 mg tablet,

ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet,

DAILY-VITE per tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET DAILY


traMADol (ULTRAM) 50 mg tablet,

zolpidem (AMBIEN) 5 mg tablet,

cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) 10 mg tablet,


diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) 50 mg capsule,

ACETAMINOPHEN/DIPHENHYDRAMINE (TYLENOL PM PO), Take  by mouth.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. There is shifting bitemporal theta
slowing in drowsiness.




Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.





Shifting bitemporal theta slowing is a nonspecific finding, within normal limits for a drowsy state.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
