HISTORY:

42 y.o. male with a history of seizures since

the age of 3, now occurring out of sleep with tongue biting


(last: 2/12/16), referred for routine EEG for characterization of

seizures.



MEDICATIONS: Trileptal


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).


The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.


There is continuous bitemporal polymorphic slowing.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Abundant (>1/10s) left fronto-temporal (T1>F7>T3>Fp1/F3)


sharp-and-wave discharges. In sleep these occasionally have a

broader field, extending to parasagittal regions (F3, C3, P3).


2. Abundant (>1/10s) independent right fronto-temporal

(T2>F8>T4>F4>Fp2) sharp-and-wave discharges


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric


background slownig.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Continuous bitemporal polymorphic slowing

2. Abundant (>1/10s) left fronto-temporal (T1>F7>T3>Fp1/F3)

sharp-and-wave discharges. In sleep these occasionally have a

broader field, extending to parasagittal regions (F3, C3, P3).


3. Abundant (>1/10s) independent right fronto-temporal

(T2>F8>T4>F4>Fp2) sharp-and-wave discharges



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of both left and right

independent fronto-temporal epileptogenic potential superimposed


on bitemporal cerebral dysfunction.
