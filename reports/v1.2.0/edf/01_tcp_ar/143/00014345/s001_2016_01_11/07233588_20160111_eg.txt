History:	53 Y/O FEMALE R HANDED. PT ADMITTED LAST NIGHT FOR WITNESSSED SZ. 
	FROM DAUGHTER SHAKING. PT DID NOT TAKE MEDS FOR DM TYPE 2 
	(INSULIN) SUGAR WAS HIGH WHEN PT WAS ADMITTED. PMHX. NO H/O
Medications:	INSULIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta 
more than delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  
intermittent diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present 
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No 
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic 
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory, 
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 60
Summary of Findings:
	Triphasic waves, intermittent anterior
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  intermittent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and 
moderate diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse 
encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
