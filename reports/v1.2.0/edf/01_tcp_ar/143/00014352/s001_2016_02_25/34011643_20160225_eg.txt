HISTORY:

27 y.o. female with a history of opiod overdose,

found down, had one shaking spell. Rhabdomyolosis referred for


routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.


MEDICATIONS:


No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

Current facility-administered medications for this visit.

LOVENOX, NARCAN, DEXTROSE, ATIVAN (2/25 3:34AM 2MG), TYLENOL


SEDATION: ATIVAN (2/25 3:34AM 2MG)


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  Head




rocking artifact was noted.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The  background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of diffuse 2


Hz delta with brief bursts 15 hz beta, some of which over-rides

the delta

During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements are seen. The

patient moves  about to stimuli, but an awake pattern is not


achieved



Sleep is characterized by delta.


Generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal routine EEG:

Replacement of normal background with a delta and beta.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


The overall pattern is non specific but compatible with

pharmacologic sedation.  These findings may be compared with her

toxicology findings.
