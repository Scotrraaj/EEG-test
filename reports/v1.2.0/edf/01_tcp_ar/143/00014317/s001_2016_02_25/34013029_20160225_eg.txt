HISTORY:

115 y.o. female with a history of TBI,


diffuse SAH and ingestion of TCA and benzodiazepines referred for

routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.  Prior SA,

gastric bypass, depression.



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra, insulin



SEDATION: Ativan



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation. Patient

was intubated, biting on ETT and producing muscle artifact.


Patient is poorly reactive.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background  consists of a mixture of theta of 5-6 Hz, frontal

delta and scant alpha.  Bifrontal delta, activity, L>R is noted.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Stimulation of the patient produces brief alerting with an

increase in theta and a questionable 5 Hz PDR.


Sleep is not well defined.



Generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present; L

>R frontal delta.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile stimulation, described above



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 104 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine ICU EEG.


1. Generalized background slowing.

2. Shifting slowing, L frontal more than Right.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This  EEG supports a bi-hemispheric process. Reactivity,


variability and the ability to elicit a slow alpha in a

responsive patient are positive prognostic findings. No

epileptiform features were seen.

This routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.
