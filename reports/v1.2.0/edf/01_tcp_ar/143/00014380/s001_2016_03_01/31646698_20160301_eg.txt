HISTORY:

29 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy

referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.

risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) 2 mg tablet, Take 2.5 mg by mouth daily.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies,


with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm

(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and


amplitude is present but suboptimal.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Suboptimal organization


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild


diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
