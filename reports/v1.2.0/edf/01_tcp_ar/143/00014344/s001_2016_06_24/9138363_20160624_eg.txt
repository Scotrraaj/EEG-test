DATE OF STUDY: 06/24/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: 


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only





HISTORY:

a 71 y.o. male with a history of multicompartamental
intracerebral/subarachnoid/intraventricular bleed, s/p evacuation 6/23 and EVD x2, referred for
routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures and assessment of mental status change.




MEDICATIONS: Keppra, morphine, others



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous and symmetric but disorganized, and consists of mostly delta with
admixed theta. Occasionally focal polymorphic slowing is seen over the left hemisphere.





There is no posterior dominant rhythm. There is no clear reactivity, variability, or state change to
noxious stimulation.




Severe generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) left posterior quadrant (T5/O1 max, occasionally reflecting over right
occiput, O2) sharp waves

2. Occasional left temporal sharp waves with a broad field



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing, with background disorganization and lack of reactivity


2. Occasional left hemispheric polymorphic slowing

3. Frequent left posterior quadrant sharp waves

4. Occasional left temporal sharp waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of left hemispheric dysfunction superimposed on severe diffuse
dysfunction, with superimposed epileptogenic potential over the left posterior quadrant and left
temporal regions.



Attending Epileptologist: 


I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
