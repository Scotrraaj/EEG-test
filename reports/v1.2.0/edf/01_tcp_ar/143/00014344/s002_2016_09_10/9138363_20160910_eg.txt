DATE OF STUDY: 09/10/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 72 y.o. male with a history of R basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ IVH s/p VPS,
admitted with pneumonia, altered mental status, and worsened ventriculomegaly, referred for routine
EEG for assessment of mental status change.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized mixture of alpha and
beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The
normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.



There is continuous right frontal polymorphic slowing with increased amplitudes, consistent with
breach rhythm.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and further background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Mild generalized slowing is present.

In addition to the aforementioned continuous right frontal polymorphic slowing, frequent left > right
bitemporal independent polymorphic slowing, often characterized as high amplitude delta slowing,
is present. The high amplitude delta slowing may also represent breach rhythm.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:




None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Continuous right frontal polymorphic slowing

3. Breach rhythms as above

4. Frequent left > right bitemporal independent polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of right frontal cerebral dysfunction that is likely structural in
etiology, superimposed on an etiologically nonspecific bitemporal cerebral dysfunction and mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known history of a skull defect.
