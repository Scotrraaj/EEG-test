DATE OF STUDY: 09/14/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 54 y.o. female with a history of idiopathic generalized epilepsy and
headaches referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS: ZONISAMIDE, TOPIRAMATE, THEODUR, NEURONTIN



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR), often manifested as half-alpha variant. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency
and amplitude is present.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric sleep spindles
and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) bursts of 3 Hz polyspike-and-wave up to 3 sec in duration

This activity fragments equally across the hemispheres in drowsiness and is often seen preceding a K
complex during stage II sleep (dyshormia).




OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Half alpha variant (a normal variant)



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with fair cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


The patient reported feeling cold, anxious. During hyperventilation she reported that her right leg
was shaking. The tech did not see visible shaking during this complaint. There was no seizure activity
associated with this complaint.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Frequent bursts of 3 Hz polyspike and wave for < 3 sec duration





CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are consistent with this patient's prior reported history of idiopathic generalized
epilepsy.


The above clinical complaints were not associated with seizure activity on EEG.
