HISTORY:

58 y.o. 58 YO MAN P/W RIGHT FOOT WOUND. PT

NOW IN SEPTIC SHOCK.  EEG TO RULE OUT SZ.



MEDICATIONS:



ATIVAN (1MG 3/20 AT 3AM), DILTIAZEM, OXYCODONE, LINEZOLID,

CEFEPIME, FAMOTIDINE, METRONIDAZOLE



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was

characterized by diffuse low voltage delta activity with absence


of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.

Some central theta activity was seen at times.


Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of

moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


No seizures were seen.
