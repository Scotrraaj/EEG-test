HISTORY:

52 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy since childhood; last episode was 1 month
ago (LOC, postictal confusion) referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) 15 mg tablet, Take 60 mg by mouth at bedtime.

ACETAMINOPHEN/DIPHENHYDRAMINE (TYLENOL PM PO), Take  by mouth.


albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs
every 6 hours as needed for Wheezing.


tramadol (ULTRAM) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for Pain.

divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth daily.

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.


clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 0.5 mg by mouth 3 times daily as needed.

lovastatin (MEVACOR) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth nightly.

nicotine (NICODERM CQ) 21 mg/24 hr, Place 1 patch onto the skin every 24 hours.




Temazepam (RESTORIL) 30 mg capsule, Take 30 mg by mouth nightly as needed.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture predominantly low voltage
fast frequency activity. No clear posterior dominant rhythm is captured, but patient continually blinks
throughotu the entire study.


Drowsiness and sleep are not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  A background consisting of low voltage fast frequencies
can be a normal variant in an adult. There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake only routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
