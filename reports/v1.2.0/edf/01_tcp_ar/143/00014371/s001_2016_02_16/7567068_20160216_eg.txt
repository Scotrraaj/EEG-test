HISTORY:

51 y.o. male with a history of SCHIZOPRENIA,

CHF, OSA, presenting for evaluation of EPISODES OF CONFUSION,


DISORIENTION, FALLS, LOC, with EYES ROLLED BACK, referred for

routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS: HCTZ, MIRALAX, COREG, ZANTAC, CRESTOR, CLARITIN,

ZESTRIL ZYPREXA, PROLIXIN



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies,


with excess theta frequencies, and with a symmetric and reactive

8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is

present but suboptimal.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



Mild generalized slowing is present.


Occasional left temporal polymorphic slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Frequent left anterior temporal (T1>F7>T3) spike-and-wave


discharges are seen



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric

background slowing.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional

abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Occasional left temporal polymorphic slowing


3. Frequent left anterior temporal (T1>F7>T3) spike-and-wave

discharges


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of left anterior temporal

epileptogenic discharges and left temporal dysfunction


superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

Though the mild generalized slowing is an etiologically

nonspecific finding, it can be seen in association with typical

antipsychotics.
