HISTORY:

51 y.o. male with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is seen over the left anterior temporal region.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) left anterior temporal moderate amplitude spikes with aftergoing slow
waves are seen (T1, F7, T3 max)



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.




EVENTS:




There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 1 hour  routine EEG due to:

1. Frequent left anterior temporal spikes with aftergoing slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



There is an epileptogenic focus over the left anterior temporal region.
