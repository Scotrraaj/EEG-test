HISTORY:

78 y.o. male with right fronta SDH. Hx of seizures, HTN, ETOH abuse, pancreatitis.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

cyanocobalamin injection 1,000 mcg

pyridostigmine (MESTINON) tablet 30 mg


fluconazole in NaCl (DIFLUCAN) IV 200 mg

fludrocortisone (FLORINEF) tablet 0.3 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) suspension 40 mg


midodrine (PROAMATINE) tablet 15 mg

phenol (CHLORASEPTIC) 1.4 % spray 1 spray

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 500 mg


multivitamin (THERA-M) w/minerals tablet




polyvinyl alcohol (LIQUIFILM TEARS) 1.4 % ophthalmic solution 1 drop

senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
theta and delta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:



1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and drowsy routine EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse background
slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
