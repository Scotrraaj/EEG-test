HISTORY:

77 y.o. MALE THAT HAD A EPISODE OF CONFUSION PRIOR TO BEING
ADMITTED.


MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:

multivitamin (THERAPEUTIC-M) 9 mg iron-400 mcg per tablet 1 tablet

midodrine (PROAMATINE) tablet 10 mg


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 500 mg



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to high impedance T1 and T2 electrodes and poor quality that included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Moderate diffuse slow waves


CLINICAL CORRELATION:






This is an abnormal limited awake only routine EEG due to diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
