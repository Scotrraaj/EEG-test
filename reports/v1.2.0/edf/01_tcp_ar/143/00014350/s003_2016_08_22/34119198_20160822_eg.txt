SEDATION: fentanyl drip


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.



Sleep is not captured



Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present.

Continuous focal slowing over the right hemisphere maximum at T4/T6. There is an associated
increased faster frequencies over this region consistent with a breach rhythm.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.






EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:

1. Continuous focal slowing over the right hemisphere maximum at the posterior temporal region
with an associated breach rhythm.


2. Moderate to severe generalized slowing.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximum at the posterior temporal region. This
finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin.


In addition, there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
