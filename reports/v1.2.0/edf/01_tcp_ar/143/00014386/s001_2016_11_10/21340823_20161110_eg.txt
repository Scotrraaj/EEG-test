HISTORY:

51 y.o. male with a history of asthma and diabetes referred for routine EEG for
evaluation of paroxysmal events.


He experienced a syncopal attack on November 2 in the afternoon.

He was at home, felt sick to his stomach, and somewhat dizzy and then passed out.


His son heard the noise and came to his side, and thus, was aware of the, patient being unconscious.

He was bleeding from a wound on this for a period

TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 12 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.

Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

none



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Photic Stimulation: symmetric driving

EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE: A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG


CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified.  If seizure is a strong
consideration, a repeat, sleep deprived EEG may be of use
