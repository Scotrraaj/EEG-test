HISTORY:

22 y.o. male with a history of traumatic seizure /Motorcycle MVA with helmet
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

SEDATION: Ativan



TECHNIQUE:

Bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International
10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically
satisfactory record despite muscle  and included a single channel of EKG and  stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a symmetric mixture of alpha and beta
frequencies, with scant symmetric and reactive 11Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is intermittently present.




Intermittent bursts of rhythmic frontal delta activity were noted




Intermittent generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile stimulation produces an alerting



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 107 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. intermittent generalized slowing


2. FIRDA

3. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings support a mild, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  This may be a
posttraumatic, sedated or toxic metabolic pattern.  No epileptiform features were seen.  A followup
EEG when the patient is out of the ICU may be of value
