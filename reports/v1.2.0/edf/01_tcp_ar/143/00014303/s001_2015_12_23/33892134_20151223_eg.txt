Medications:	LBUTEROL, LISPRO, OXAZEPAM, KEPPRA, LOVENOX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose

Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior region with an increased amplitude and faster frequencies consistent with a breach. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. HR was 84 and irr.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left frontotemporal, and breach Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left frontotemporal region. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition, there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
