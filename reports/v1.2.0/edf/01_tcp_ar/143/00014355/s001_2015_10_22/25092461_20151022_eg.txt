HISTORY:


32 y.o. male with a history of spells of

feeling odd referred for routine EEG for possible seizures.



MEDICATIONS: none reported

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION:none



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: did not activate the record


Photic Stimulation: did not activate the record



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or

electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal A, Drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.
