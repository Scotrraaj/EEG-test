HISTORY:

55 y.o. male with a history of confusion referred for routine EEG for assessment
of mental status change.


History of hypoglycemia bipolar d/o and etoh abuse, on lithium.

MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

potassium chloride IVPB 20 mEq 100 mL

dextrose 5 % in water solution 1,000 mL


thiamine (B-1) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

cloNIDine (CATAPRES) 0.2 mg/24 hr patch 0.2 mg


LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 1 mg

folic acid 1 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB

diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) capsule 25 mg



TECHNIQUE:



A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The  background is characterized by a dynamic pattern. When resting comfortable there is rhythmic
theta pattern, alternating with a mixed frequency irregular slow pattern. Sleep is characterized by
normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves and K-complexes. Slow wave
sleep was not captured.




Moderate generalized slowing is present.


Rare left focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Generalized rhythmic theta of drowsiness


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: verbal stimuli produces an alerting


EVENTS: There are  no electrographic events captured during this study.

Arousal elicits frontal delta, beta and attempts by patient to get out of bed

HEART RATE:


A heart rate of  84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized slowing

2. Multiple hallmarks of metabolic encephalopathy


3. Rare L focal slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are non specific but frequently found in association with metabolic encephalopathy or
delirium. No epileptiform features were noted.
