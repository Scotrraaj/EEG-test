HISTORY:

78 y.o. male with a history of ARF, COPD, CVAs, altered mental status, and
"seizure-like" activity, referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


KEPPRA,  METFORMIN, LISINOPRIL, COREG, GABAPENTIN, ALBUTEROL, SPIRIVA, ADVAIR,
ATORVASTATIN, NORVASC



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel portable electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded at the bedside using
the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically poor record with excessive muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:





The patient was intubated and was noted to be biting on the ET tube. Early in the recording, he was
described as awake and able to follow commands. Excessive muscle artifact obscures significant
portions of the underlying cerebral electrical activity. Readable portions of the tracing demonstrate
generalized low voltage 20-30 Hz activity and irregular low to medium amplitude widespread 3-5 Hz
slowing.





During these periods of increased drowsiness, attenuation of muscle artifact and beta activity were
seen.



Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Diffuse background slowing and disorganization. As noted, the study was extremely limited
secondary to excessive muscle artifact.



These findings are suggestive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral activity such as that seen with a
variety of generalized encephalopathies of various etiologies. If clinically indicated, a repeat study
with the patient sedated to eliminate muscle artifact may provide additional helpful information.
