HISTORY:

78 y.o. male with a history of renal failure presenting with seizure witnessed by
nurse, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS: heparin, lispro, haldol, ativan



SEDATION: as above



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The record opens to disorganized, suppressed delta activity. There is no definite reactivity. Towards
the end of the recording the background becomes more variable with disorganized low amplitude
theta activity.






There is severe generalized slowing.


There is no focal slowing.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Frequent low amplitude sharp waves over left centro-temporal region, not clearly epileptiform

2. Occasional low ampltiude sharp waves over right centro-temporal region, not clearly epileptiform



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal coma study routine EEG due to:


1. Severe generalized slowing and disorganized background, with no definite reactivity, though
variability is present towards end of study

2. Bilateral independent L > R centro-temporal sharp waves, which are not definitely epileptiform



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
