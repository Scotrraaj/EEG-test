DATE OF STUDY: 01/18/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

 a 75 y.o. male with a history of seizures and persistently poor mental status.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


carbidopa-levodopa (SINEMET CR) 25-100 mg per tablet 1 tablet

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg/4 mL suspension 100 mg

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 3 Units


insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 10 Units

aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg

dextrose 50% injection 25 mL


dextrose 50% injection 50 mL

glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units


amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 5 mg




atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 80 mg

tamsulosin (FLOMAX) 24 hr capsule 0.4 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units


dextrose 50% injection 25 mL

dextrose 50% injection 50 mL

glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg






SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.



The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude theta and delta
activity.  There is subtle paucity of faster frequencies over the right temporal region.



No normal sleep architecture is captured, but during periods of quiescence there is increase in the
amount of delta activity and appearance of brief periods of discontinuity.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.





Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal portable routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate diffuse slowing

2. Subtle right temporal focal slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.

Subtle focal right temporal slowing is indicative of a focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in
etiology.
