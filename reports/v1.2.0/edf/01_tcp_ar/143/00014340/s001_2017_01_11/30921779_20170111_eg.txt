DATE OF STUDY: 01/11/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 75 y.o. male with a history of seizures, now presents after an observed seizure.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 5 mg

aspirin EC tablet 81 mg

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 80 mg


tamsulosin (FLOMAX) 24 hr capsule 0.4 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 6 Units


phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg/4 mL suspension 100 mg

[START ON 1/12/2017] vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB
MB+
piperacillin-tazobactam (ZOSYN) 3.375 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB MB+


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL




heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

dextrose 50% injection 25 mL


dextrose 50% injection 50 mL

glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg


insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 12 Units

sodium polystyrene (KAYEXALATE) suspension 15 g





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.



The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude theta and delta
activity.



Patient remains awake throughout the recording.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
