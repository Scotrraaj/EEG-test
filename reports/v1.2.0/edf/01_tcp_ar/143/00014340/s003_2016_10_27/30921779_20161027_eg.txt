HISTORY:

75 y.o. male who presents with seizures in the setting of severe hyperglycemia.
Patient is currently comatose, ventilated and sedated on propofol.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

insulin regular 100 units in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg

heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units


LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 1 mg

folic acid injection 1 mg

thiamine (B-1) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB


dexmedetomidine (PRECEDEX) 400 mcg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion

dextrose 5 % and sodium chloride 0.45 % with KCl 20 mEq/L infusion







SEDATION: propofol



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.



The background consists of burst-suppression pattern with burst-to-suppression ratio of ~1:2-1:6.  Bursts
consists of diffuse sloow low amplitude delta activity and last ~ 1 second.



No normal sleep architecture is captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is minimal reactivity to noxious stimuli characterized by more
frequent bursts of activity.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to:


1. 1:2-1:6 burst-suppression pattern



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This finding is indicative of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific,
but, in this case, at least partially related to the medication effect.
