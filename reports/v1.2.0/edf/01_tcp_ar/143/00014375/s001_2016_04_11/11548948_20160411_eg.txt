HISTORY:

53 y.o. MAN WITH CC OF HEADACHES OCCIPITAL

AREA. ONSET APPROX 3 MONTHS AGO. WHEN HAS ONE IT LAST 1 WK.


PMHX: SEIZURES.  LAST SZ 4/4/16. LOC/GTC/TONGUE BITE.  PER PT HE

TAKES HIS MEDS BUT HAS BEEN LOW ON LABS.



MEDICATIONS:

DILANTIN



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and




photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Occasional burst lasting 1-3 seconds of symmetric frontal

predominant generalized spike and polyspike and wave are seen at

a frequency of 3-3.5 Hz.



No clinical correlate is noted with the discharges.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional


abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Fast generalized spike and polyspike and wave



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are seen in patients with idiopathic generalized


epilepsy.
