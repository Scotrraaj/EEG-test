TECHNIQUE:



Digital 21 channel electroencephalogram monitoring (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-
20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG.


The recording begins with the patient awake in the OR and continues through sedation, hypothermia
and then be warming after completion of the procedure.  The study was monitored with one on one,
remote physician review


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive  10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  The awake pattern is low voltage with generous beta.


Induction: Produces bursts of rhythmic slowing, then a burst suppression pattern


COOLING: 11:00 AM - the patient is cool to 16.9.  The EEG becomes flat at 12:05, for a 5 minute
time observation time until 12: 10  and.  Circulatory arrest is at 12:10.  The patient was placed on
circulatory arrest twice



REWARMING: 1:24- the EEG gradually starts to return with lower voltage rhythmic mixed theta delta.
It is essentially continuous spike 2 PM.  Throughout the remainder of the EEG, there is a mixed
frequency, symmetric continuous pattern




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE: 87 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION:


EEG monitoring during the intraoperative use of therpuetic hypothermia demonstrated attenuation
and then suppression of cerebral activity followed by return of a rich, bihemispheric pattern.


These results were reported to the operative team during the procedure.
