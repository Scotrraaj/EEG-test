HISTORY:

51 y.o. male with a history of bipolar disease, agitation, possible seizures
referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Haldol, Insulin, Nystatin, Protonix, Amlodipine, Lovenox, Lisinopril, Valproic Acid, Ativan,
Atrovatatin, Vancomycin, Zosyn




TECHNIQUE:


A portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and  stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a continuous symmetric mixture of delta
and beta frequencies, without  a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The
normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Moderate generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Not possible


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. generalized background slowing


2. absence of some of the normal waveforms anticipated in an adult such as an alpha rhythm


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  They
can also beseen in postictal state.  Patient's cooperativity limits additional EEG monitoring at this
time
