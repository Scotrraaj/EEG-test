DATE OF STUDY: 04/27/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only




HISTORY:

a 30 y.o. male with a history of coma and possible viral meningitis.



MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs listed



SEDATION: fentanyl drip and ativan drip


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.


The background consists of attenuated slow polymorphic delta activity admixed with frequent diffuse
sleep-spindle-like waveforms.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Continuous EKG artifact.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



There appears some reactivity to noxious stimuli characterized by increase in amplitude of delta
activity.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of nearly 100 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal comatose portable 21--minute  routine EEG due to:

1. Marked diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding is indicative of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific,
but, in this case, at least partially related to the medication effect.



Minor background reactivity is present.
