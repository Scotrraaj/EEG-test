DATE OF STUDY: 08/08/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 50 y.o. WOMAN WHO IN  HAD AA REPLACEMENT SURGERY / CVA. WITH
SLURRED SPEECH.  2 MONTHS AGO HAD EVENT OF EYES BLINKING AND WOULD NOT OPEN
PER PATIENT




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.

alprazolam (XANAX) 1 mg tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth twice a day

divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth twice a day

instructions provided by your doctor. Please call (215) 707-9950 if you need help completing this
prep.

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

senna-docusate (SENNOSIDES-DOCUSATE SODIUM) 8.6-50 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth
daily.
metoprolol tartrate (LOPRESSOR) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.





albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs
every 6 hours as needed for Wheezing.


tiZANidine (ZANAFLEX) 4 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
