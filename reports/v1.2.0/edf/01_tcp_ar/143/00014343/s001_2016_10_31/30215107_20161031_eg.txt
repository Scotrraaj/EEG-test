HISTORY:

58 y.o. male PRESENTS WITH   RT SIDED WEAKNESS, ISCHEMIC STROKE.
PRIOR EEG



MEDICATIONS:


No current facility-administered medications for this encounter.

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

acetaminophen-codeine (TYLENOL-CODEINE #3) 300-30 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth
every 6 hours as needed for Pain.





SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The limited waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and diffuse,
frontally predominant 5-10uV, (18-25Hz) bifrontal beta activity.  Wakefulness is characterized by a
symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



The records is mainly in sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and
symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal limited awake and mainly asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or
electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal limited awake and mainly asleep routine EEG. A normal routine EEG does not
support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.






Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
