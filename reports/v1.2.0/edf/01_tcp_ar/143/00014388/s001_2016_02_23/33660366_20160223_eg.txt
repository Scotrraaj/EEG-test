HISTORY:

41 y.o. female with a history of suicidal

ideation, delusions, and depression referred for routine EEG for


assessment of psychosis.


MEDICATIONS: diphenhydramine, metformin, famotidine, naproxen,


clozapine, nicotine, others


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system and utilized a NicOne system. This was

a technically difficult study, with continuous electrode artifact

in T4, rendering channels with that lead limited in


interpretation.  The study included a single channel of EKG and




photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a


fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies,

with symmetric fragments of an irregular 8.5-9 Hertz posterior

dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient

of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.



During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior


dominant rhythm and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep transients are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal, though technically limited, awake and drowsy

routine EEG due to:


1. Suboptimal organization


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of the


presence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
