HISTORY: A 70-year-old male with history of metastatic prostate cancer, admitted on the 27th, with an overdose of unknown substance, now intubated in the ICU.
MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin, others.
INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute bedside portable digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient was intubated and relatively unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow, primarily delta pattern with smaller amounts of theta. There is a little bit of variability. Tactile stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity as well as brief muscle artifact.
EKG: difficult to interpret, but 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. moderately severe background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter. Correlation with clinical history and imaging is suggested.
