HISTORY:

23 y.o. male with a history of seizures.  Patient has a VP shunt in place.



MEDICATIONS:

Phenobarbital




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:






The background consists of moderate amplitude polymorphic up to 7 hz theta activity that attenuates
with eye opening.  There is diffuse excess polymorphic theta activity and AP (anterior-to-posterior)
gradient


Is weak.



Diffuse excess beta activity is captured.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing and background disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:




These finding are indicative of mild- to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.





The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
