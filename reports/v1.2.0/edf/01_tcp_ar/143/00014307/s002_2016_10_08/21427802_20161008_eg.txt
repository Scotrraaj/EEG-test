HISTORY: 76 y.o. male with a history of repetitive seizures referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures. He was "transferred from nursing home to Jeanes ED for AMS. EMS reported witnessing a generalized seizure. In Jeanes ED he received 6mg of Versed total and 1500 mg of Keppra with no relief. He was transferred her for management of suspected status epilepticus. No report of semiology in ED however - in nursing home he was dining and then started twitching in his arms? Which progressed to full "seizure" sx per note" then somnolent.
MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg latanoprost (XALATAN) 0.005 % ophthalmic solution 1 drop dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg budesonide (PULMICORT) nebulizer solution 0.5 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 5 Units LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB
SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.
DAY 1 - 10/8/2016 to 10/09.2016, 12:00)
BACKGROUND: Initially the background is characterized by the presence of a well-organized symmetric mixture of theta and delta with scant alpha and beta frequencies, without a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is not present.  Marked generalized slowing is present. The overall background is a theta delta pattern. However, with time there is more of a theta pattern. No focal slowing is present.  The background is reactive, Variable. Intermittently there is scant theta  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Sleep was ill defined, characterized by an increase in delta.
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None
EVENTS: NONE
EKG: A single lead captured 96 BPM- decreasing to 64 BPM
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Generalized slowing. No seizures were recorded. Findings discussed with team. Given patient's improvement in MSE, EEG recording discontinued on the AM of 10-09-16
