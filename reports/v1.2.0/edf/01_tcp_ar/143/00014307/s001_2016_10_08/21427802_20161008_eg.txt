HISTORY: 76 y.o. male with a history of memory loss, transferred from another hospital after repetitive seizures last night, now somnolent. Now  referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg latanoprost (XALATAN) 0.005 % ophthalmic solution 1 drop dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg budesonide (PULMICORT) nebulizer solution 0.5 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 5 Units LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB  TECHNIQUE: A  Bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.  EEG BACKGROUND: The background is characterized by the presence of a wellorganized symmetric mixture of theta and delta with scant  alpha and beta frequencies, without  a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is not present.  Marked generalized slowing is present.  The overall background is a theta delta pattern.  No focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile stimulation produces an alerting response with theta EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to: 1. Generalized slowing.   CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are compatible with a diffuse CNS disturbance. No seizures were recorded. Given the recent repetitive seizures, LTM will follow. Results discussed with team.
