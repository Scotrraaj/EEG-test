DATE OF STUDY: 09/21/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 34 y.o. female with a history of blackout and urinary incontinence on 7/27/16,
referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

melatonin 3 mg Tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth at bedtime.

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily for 360 days.


amitriptyline (ELAVIL) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.

amLODIPine (NORVASC) 5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

chlorthalidone (HYGROTEN) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background consists of symmetric 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Alpha activity
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 68 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. If clinically indicated, a
sleep deprived EEG capturing stage II sleep or ambulatory EEG may provide additional helpful
information.
