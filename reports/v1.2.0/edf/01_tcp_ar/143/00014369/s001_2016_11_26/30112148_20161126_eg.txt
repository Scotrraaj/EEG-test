HISTORY: 63 y.o. WOMAN PRESENTS FROM OSH WITH ? ACUTE INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE. PT HAD A LEFT FRONTAL GBM 7/2016 AND 1 SEIZURE.   MRSA  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 5 mg in dextrose 5 % 50 mL IVPB vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+ dexamethasone (DECADRON) injection 10 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion morphine injection 2 mg oxyCODONE (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 5 mg acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) EC tablet 10 mg magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL sodium phosphates (FLEET) enema 1 enema alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 2-10 Units labetalol (NORMODYNE,TRANDATE) injection 10 mg hydrALAZINE (APRESOLINE) injection 10 mg levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB lacosamide (VIMPAT) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/26/2016, 15:37- 11/27/2016, 09:47)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse very low voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  The background is mildly variable.  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Sleep was not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured 60  DAY 1 IMPRESSION  1. moderate to severe diffuse background slowing   CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to moderate to severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
