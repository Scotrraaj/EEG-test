HISTORY:

69 YR OLD FEMALE TRANSPLANT EVAL FOR LIVER FAILURE PMHX.

CIRRHOSIS,HTN,DM,DEPRESSION referred for routine EEG for


assessment of mental status change.


MEDICATIONS: Hydrocortisone, lactulose, rifaximin SEDATION: not


reported.


TECHNIQUE:


Bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with

T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a


technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of

EKG and tactile stimulation.  There is a great deal of muscle

artifact noted in the background.  The patient appears to be


relatively unresponsive, with an NG tube.




EEG BACKGROUND:



There are no waveforms of a normal awake pattern.  The overall

EEG is low voltage, slow and relatively featureless.  The patient


is quiet, there is more variable voltage delta with smaller

amount of theta pattern.  Stimulation of the patient produces

muscle.

Generalized slowing is present.


Focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Tactile and auditory stimulation does not activate the EEG


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:


1.  Replacement of normal background with a lower voltage slow

pattern


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific but support a diffuse,

bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function as MayBE seen in


toxic or metabolic encephalopathy
