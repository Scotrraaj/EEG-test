HISTORY:

36 y.o. female with a history of left frontotemporal stroke, aneurysm coiling, prior
seizures, with increased right-sided weakness and speech difficulty today following a urologic
procedure, referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background demonstrates prominent interhemispheric asymmetry with well-developed 9-
10 Hz rhythmic activity posteriorly on the right and irregular 5-6 Hz activity on the left. Nearly
continuous irregular medium amplitude 2-5 Hz activity was seen over left frontotemporal scalp
regions. Frequent left anterior temporal sharp waves were seen at F7 and occasional less prominent
sharp transients were also noted in the left mid temporal region at T5.





During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and increased
left greater than right hemispheric background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:



There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Left hemispheric slowing.


2. Left temporal sharp waves at F7 and T5.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of a problem and functional disturbance involving the left
hemisphere with potential epileptogenic discharges in the anterior greater than mid left temporal
regions. No clinical or electrographic seizures were seen. Clinical correlation is recommended.
