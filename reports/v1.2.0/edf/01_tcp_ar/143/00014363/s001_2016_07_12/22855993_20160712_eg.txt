HISTORY:

63 y.o. male with a history of left carotid occlusion presenting with episodes of right
sided shaking referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events. Patient also notified the
tech that he has had episodes of loss of consciousness, falling, and shaking.

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


Much of the record consists of drowsiness.


During brief periods of wakefulness, the background is characterized by the presence of a well
organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR) that approaches 10 Hz. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of
frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

There is occasional left temporal polymorphic slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:





Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Occasional left temporal polymorphic slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of left temporal cerebral dysfunction.

If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
