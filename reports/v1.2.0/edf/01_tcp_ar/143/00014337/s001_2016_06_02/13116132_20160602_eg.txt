SEDATION:Precidex
TECHNIQUE: A bedside ICU Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND: The background is characterized by the presence of a low voltage delta pattern. Tactile stimulation produces some theta.  Generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Tactile stimulation produces some theta.
EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE: A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal ICU routine EEG due to: 1.  Marked generalized slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are non-specific but support a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  Reactivity is a positive prognostic finding.
