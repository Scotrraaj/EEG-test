History:	25 yer old woman with a history of childhood absence seizures.  Seizure-free for 
	many years, now with a recent convulsion.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow 
No focal slowing is present.  Several 0.5-1 second bursts of fast (~4.5-5 Hz) generalized frontally 
predominant spike and wave discharges are captured.  On a single occasion (at 1:59:37 PM) an 
isolated moderate amplitude left frontocentral (F3/C3 maximal) spike with aftergoing slow wave is 
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.  
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional 
Summary of Findings:
	Spike-and-wave complexes, fast
	Spikes, one, left, frontocentral
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy 23-minute EEG due to several bursts of fast 
generalized spike-and-wave complexes and a single left frontocentral spike. This EEG is suggestive 
of generalized mechanism of epilepsy versus focal frontal lobe focus that results in secondary
