HISTORY:

a 59 y.o. FEMALE WITH CC DIZZY/BLURRY VISION/

FLUCTUATING RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS, DYSARTHIA./ TPA.



MEDICATIONS:

PLAVIX, LIPITOR, PROTONIX, TYLENOL 3



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

poorly organized infrequent anterior to posterior gradient with


frontocentral beta and a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at

best reached 8 Hertz.



Mainly the background consisted of diffuse theta with intermixed

frequent bursts of frontal predominant high amplitude

disorganized theta more than delta discharges seen with


drowsiness.



Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1. Mild to moderate diffuse slow



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to mild to

moderate diffuse slow. This finding is consistent with diffuse


cerebral dysfunction which is non-specific with regards to

etiology. No seizures were seen,
