HISTORY:

115 y.o. male with a history of TBI- perhaps seizure related fall with  referred for
routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.


Imaging with

with a thin anterior falcine and possibly right tentorial subdural Hematoma. 2. Acute nondisplaced
fracture of the fused left occipital condyle and  lateral mass of C1


MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


fentaNYL (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection 25 mcg

fentaNYL (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection 25 mcg

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion


HYDROmorphone (DILAUDID) injection 0.5 mg

HYDROmorphone (DILAUDID) injection 1 mg

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB


TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and vigorous stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


Initial sections of the record demonstrate a markedly slow low voltage and relatively suppressed
record.  Midway through the record, with vigorous stimulation, the patient alerts with a theta pattern,
eye opening and is able to provide verbal responsiveness.  In this low voltage record, the record does
seem to be a little bit lower voltage and more attenuated on the right



Marked generalized slowing is present.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  See above

EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 108  bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1.  Initially markedly slow low voltage record, more suppressed on the right

2.  Movement to a moderately slow pattern



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings support an acute CNS process.  The dramatic improvement during the course of this
EEG may reflect either improvement from the TBI, seizure or waning of his sedation.
