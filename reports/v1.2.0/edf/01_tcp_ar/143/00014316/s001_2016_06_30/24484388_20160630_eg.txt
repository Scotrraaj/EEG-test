DATE OF STUDY: 06/30/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: 

EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

 a 33 y.o. female with a history of IVDA, Hep C, depression and axiety referred for
routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Lamictal, Klonopin, Remeron, others




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A bedside  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  Limited  record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal  stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
theta alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive  7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Moderate generalized slowing is present.

Focal slowing is present.  Although there is head rocking artifact, there seems to be higher amplitude
slowing noted in the right posterior region in comparison to the left



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

FIRDA



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: n/a

EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 80 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1.  Generalized slowing

2. Focal slowing posteriorly, R>L


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  Correlation with imaging and toxic
or metabolic factors is suggested.  There is artifact in this record, but there is also a suggestion of
right posterior slowing which may be correlated with imaging





Attending Epileptologist: 



I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
