SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A  Bedside portable digital video ICU 21 channel


electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International

10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system.


This was a technically challenging record and included a single

channel of EKGand tactile stimulation. Electrode artifacts could

not be resolved.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background includes a mixed frequency pattern, with a


suggestion of 8 Hz alpha on left only.

During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the left  posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.  Focal delta and disruption of


faster frequency are noted on the right.




Sleep is characterized by symmetric vertex waves, sleep

spindles.. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.  Right focal slowing is

present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 97 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an normalroutine EEG:

Technically challenging

Right sided focal slowing.

There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or


detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This EEG supports a structural process on the right. It does not


support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
