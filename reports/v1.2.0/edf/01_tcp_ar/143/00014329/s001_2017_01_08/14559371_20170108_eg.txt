START DATE OF STUDY: 01/08/17 at 17:23 END DATE OF STUDY: 1/10/2017 at 3PM  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 62 y.o. male with a history of mitochondrial disease who has developed episodes of staring off, recently followed by shaking of arms and legs rhythmically during the episode. Episodes also were lasting longer (30 seconds instead of 20 per the wife). He is now referred for EEG for characterization of seizures.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: dextrose 5 % and sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 1,000 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg calcium carbonate (OS-CAL) tablet 1,250 mg cyanocobalamin tablet 1,000 mcg furosemide (LASIX) tablet 80 mg levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) injection 100 mcg lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 20 mg ondansetron (ZOFRAN) tablet 8 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg potassium chloride tablet 20 mEq senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet sucralfate (CARAFATE) tablet 1 g dabigatran etexilate (PRADAXA) capsule 150 mg FLUoxetine (PROZAC) capsule 40 mg levocarnitine (CARNITOR) solution 990 mg   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (1/8/2017, 17:23 - 1/9/2017, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of alpha with admixed beta.  Posterior dominant rhythm was present at 9 Hz.  The background is reactive and variable.  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  There is rare left temporal polymorphic slowing.  Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead was not recording properly  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Rare left temporal polymorphic slowing     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (1/9/2017, 06:00 - 1/9/2017, 09:30)  BACKGROUND: No change Leads become disconnected 1/9 09:30.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change compared with day 1     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 cont. (1/9/2017, 09:30 - 1/10/2017, 3PM)  BACKGROUND:  Well organized anterior to posterior gradient and a PDR of 9Hz. At times some excessive theta is noted in wakefulness. The background is reactive and variable.  Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: mild excess theta is noted.  FOCAL SLOWING: Occasional left temporal polymorphic slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s  DAY 2 cont. IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION 1. Occasional focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. 2. Mild diffuse background slowing.  This findings is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.      -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Rare left temporal polymorphic slowing 2. Mild diffuse background slowing.  This findings is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of left temporal dysfunction superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both etiologically nonspecific.
