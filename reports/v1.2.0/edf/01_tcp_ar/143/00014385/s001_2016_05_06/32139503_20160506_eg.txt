HISTORY:

20 y.o. MAN WITH SZ LIKELY 2' ETOH WITHDRAWAL.    S/P LAPROSCOPY
SURGERY FOR SPLENIC CYST



MEDICATIONS:

DILAUDID, OFIRMV, MORPHINE, OXYCODONE, XANAX, UNASYN,



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.






Excessive 5-7Hz diffuse activity is seen in wakefulness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Excessive theta in wakefulness



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to excessive theta in wakefulness. These
finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


No epileptiform activity was seen.
