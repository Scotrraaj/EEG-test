HISTORY:

67 y.o. female who presented with a headache and seizure and was found to have
left parietal and right posterior limb of internal capsule acute hematomas as well as multiple chronic
small hemorrhages, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


hydrALAZINE (APRESOLINE) split-tablet 37.5 mg

NIFEdipine (PROCARDIA XL) 24 hr tablet 30 mg

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg


magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL

docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg

senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 750 mg


SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but
suboptimal.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.


There is continuous left temporal polymorphic slowing.

There is occasional independent right temporal polymorphic slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Suboptimal organization




2. Continuous left temporal polymorphic slowing

3. Occasional independent right temporal polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of left temporal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in
etiology, superimposed on right temporal cerebral dysfunction (structural or physiologic in origin) and
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
