HISTORY:

70 y.o. male with a history of severe lung disease, now after 2 episodes of
prolonged cardiac arrest.



MEDICATIONS:

Fentanyl, versed




SEDATION: fentanyl, versed



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.




The background consists of a mixture of attenuated polymorphic theta<<delta activity.  With
stimulation, there is appearance of diffuse EMG artifact, increase in the background voltage, and
increase in the amount of diffuse polymorphic delta activity.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~116 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate-to-severe diffuse background slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This finding is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.


Subtle background reactivity indicates favorable prognosis for some neurological recovery.
