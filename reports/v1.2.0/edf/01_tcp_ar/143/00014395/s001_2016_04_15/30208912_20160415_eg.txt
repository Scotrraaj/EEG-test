SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 8-8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm

(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and


amplitude is present.  There is a modest background 6-7 Hz theta

noted in wakefulness


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:

There are 0no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. mild background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific.  A mild, diffuse disturbance of

cerebral function such as carbon monoxide poisoning could produce


this pattern.  However, the patient's extensive medication list

could also contribute to the slowing.
