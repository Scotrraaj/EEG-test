Priors

MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 20 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 1 mg


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 5 mg

hydrALAZINE (APRESOLINE) injection 10 mg









SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal (left more than
right) region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


1.  Occasional focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal (left more than right) region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG due to occasional focal slowing in the bilateral
anterior temporal (left more than right) region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
