DATE OF STUDY: 04/18/2016

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 60 y.o. male with a history of dementia, found

down, possible syncope referred for routine EEG for assessment of


mental status change.


MEDICATIONS:


Tazo




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


difficult record and included a single channel of EKG. the




patient was sweating profusely and there was significant sweat

artifact



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 8.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and


amplitude is present.  There is prominent excess beta and excess

beta



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

none



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90, irreg bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. excess beta


2. excess theta

3. prominent sweat artifact, limiting the record



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are nonspecific.  Medications, postictal state or

this patient's underlying medical conditions could all


contributed to the theta and beta described above.  If epilepsy

is an important consideration please obtain an outpatient EEG


with the patient is more comfortable
