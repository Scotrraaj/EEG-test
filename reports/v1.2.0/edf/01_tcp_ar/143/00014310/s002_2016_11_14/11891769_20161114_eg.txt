HISTORY:

63 y.o. female with a history of recent CVA, now with episodes with eyes
rolling up and involuntary movements of the hands, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of
paroxysmal events.  She is amnestic for the events




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

fluticasone-salmeterol (ADVAIR) 100-50 mcg/dose diskus inhaler 1 puff


[START ON 11/15/2016] losartan (COZAAR) tablet 100 mg

[START ON 11/15/2016] sertraline (ZOLOFT) tablet 25 mg

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg


hydroCHLOROthiazide (MICROZIDE) capsule 12.5 mg

metFORMIN (GLUCOPHAGE) tablet 500 mg

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 500 mg




potassium chloride IVPB 20 mEq 100 mL



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  Photoelectric artifact is noted.
Electrode integrity is tenuous



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive  10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  There is rhythmic slowing of the ualpha
rhythm in drowsiness




Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.  There is also photoelectric artifact noted
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 42-45 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.






CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  Continuous EEG monitoring with seizure and spike
detection will follow this study
