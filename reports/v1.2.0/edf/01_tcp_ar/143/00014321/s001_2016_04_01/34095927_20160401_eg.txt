HISTORY:

56 y.o. R HANDED WOMAN HAS A BRAIN MASS ON

LEFT SIDE OF BRAIN.  WITH MULTIPLE FALLS



MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a reactive


11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that is best seen on the

right hemisphere. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of


frequency and amplitude is present on the right.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


There is continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the

left hemisphere maximal in the F3 region. At times this slowing


becomes rhythmic an appears to evolve for seconds with no

clinical correlate. This discharges are concerning for


electrographic seizures.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Frequent left frontal (F3) sharp waves



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



1. Intermittent rhythmic slowing concerning for electrographic

seizures


2. Frequent Left frontal sharp waves

3. Continuous left hemisphere focal slowing maximal in the


frontal region.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal routine EEG due to possible electrographic


seizures, frequent sharp waves and continuous focal slowing all

in the left frontal region.  This finding is indicative of severe


focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability in this region,

likely structural in origin and potentially epileptogenic. The

patient will go on to LTM.
