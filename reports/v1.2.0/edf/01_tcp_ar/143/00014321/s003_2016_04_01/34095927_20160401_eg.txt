HISTORY:

56 y.o. R HANDED WOMAN with L hemispheric

mass with vasogenic edema,


Confusion, and MULTIPLE FALLS. One month history of worsening

memory and falling with one day history of R sided weakness.

MEDICATIONS:


KEPPRA

Decadron

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

Continuous  Video Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with


T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. Seizure


and spike detection software was utilized. The patient was VERY




restless, but increasingly awake and oriented during the record



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a reactive

11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that is best seen on the

right hemisphere. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of

frequency and amplitude is present on the right.   Continuous


focal slow, with disruption of faster frequency is seen in the

left frontal region.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep includes stage II with vertex waves, K complexes


Focal slowing:

There is continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the

left hemisphere maximal in the F3 region.



Rhythmic L FT focal slowing is seen again on the morning of April

2.



Epileptiform features:

F3/ T3 sharps, sporadic.

Impression/clinical correlation:


No seizures were recorded. The focal slowing and sharp waves are

congruent with the baseline EEG, imaging and clinical history.


After discussion with the clinical team, in light of the

patient's difficulty sitting still and keeping the electrodes on,

the decision was made to end the LTM and follow the patient, who

was increasingly alert.
