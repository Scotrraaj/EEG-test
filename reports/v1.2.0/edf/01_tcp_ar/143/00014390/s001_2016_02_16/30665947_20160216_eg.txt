HISTORY:

49 y.o. male with a history of depressed skull

fracture referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status


change.


MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA, LOVENOX, NICOTINE PATCH, MORPHINE PRN



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically difficult hook-up, tech

notes that impedances were < 10 kOhm but that patient's scalp was

very tender to touch. The study included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a


fairly organized mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).


The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present but suboptimal.


There is continuous right centrotemporal polymorphic slowing.


There is occasional left hemispheric polymorphic slowing.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and further

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 82 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Suboptimal organization

2. Continuous right centrotemporal polymorphic slowing


3. Occasional left hemispheric polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are indicate the presence of right centrotemporal

dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and left hemispheric

dysfunction (structural or physiologic in etiology), superimposed


on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
