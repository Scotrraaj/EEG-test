 HISTORY: 70 y.o. MALE R HANDED WITH DAUGHTER SHE SAYS HER FATHER HAS A TUMOR ON R SIDE OF HIS HEAD. ALSO STATES HE HAS HAD 3X SZ IN LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.  MEDICATIONS: ATIVAN, KEPPRA  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. However, the record was mistakenly unplugged from about 7PM to 10:30PM  and later unplugged multiple electrodes the first night.  DAY 1 (07/06/2016, 19:07 - 7/07/2016, 08:00)  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well-organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.   During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the C4/P4 region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Intermittent C4/P4 spikes and polyspikes are seen. At times semi-rhythmic with no evolution.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION: 1. Right Centro-parietal region sharp waves 2. Intermittent focal slowing in the right Centro-parietal region.    CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to right Centro-parietal region sharp wave and intermittent focal slowing.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability in this region, which is potentially epileptogenic.  ---------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (07/07/2016, 19:07 - 7/08/2016, 08:33)  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well-organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.   During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the C4/P4 region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs), C4/P4 spikes and polyspikes are seen at 4hz with no evolution but the patient complains of left arm twitching. At times this wax and wane but are mainly present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: See PLEDs above  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  DAY 2 IMPRESSION: 1. Right Centro-parietal region PLEDs with clinical correlate. 2. Intermittent focal slowing in the right Centro-parietal region.    CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to right Centro-parietal region PLEDs with arm jerking consistent with focal motor simple partial status epilepticus.
