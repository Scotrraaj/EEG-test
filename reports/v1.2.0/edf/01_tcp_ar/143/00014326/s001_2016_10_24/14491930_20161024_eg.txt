SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.


Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the
recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag. At times this discharges
are sharply contoured and quasi-rhythmic but they do not clearly evolve.


At times this pattern improves and a move organized and faster frequencies are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Triphasic waves

2. Moderate diffuse slow waves and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to frequent frontally-maximal triphasic
waves and moderate diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse
encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
