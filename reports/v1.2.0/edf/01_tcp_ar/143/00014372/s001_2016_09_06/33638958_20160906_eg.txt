DATE OF STUDY: 09/06/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only





HISTORY:

a 61 y.o. female with a history of altered mental status, referred for routine EEG for
assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) tablet 25 mg

dextrose 50% injection 25 mL


dextrose 50% injection 50 mL

glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion


multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet 1 tablet

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 80 mg

NIFEdipine (PROCARDIA XL) 24 hr tablet 90 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

nicotine (NICORETTE) gum 2 mg



clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg

fluticasone (FLONASE) 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray 2 spray


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg


heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units


SEDATION: Ativan



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically suboptimal record
due to near continuous muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha, theta, and delta frequencies. Occasionally fragments of an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR) are visible. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is absent.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Occasional frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA / GRDA) at 2 Hz is present for <5
seconds.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal, technically limited, awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing

2. Suboptimal organization

3. Occasional frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

Frontally predominant generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA, also known as FIRDA) is a
nonspecific but pathologic finding that is most commonly seen in toxic-metabolic states, but may
also be seen with deep structural lesions or increased intracranial pressure. Clinical correlation is
advised.
