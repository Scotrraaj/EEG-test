HISTORY: Male presented with multiple stab wounds, s/p code 7/13/16, referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.  MEDICATIONS: Ancef, lovenox, protonix   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.  EEG BACKGROUND: The background is characterized by the presence of a well-organized diffuse alpha frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive ranging from 8-9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). There is a slight anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude. There is a small degree of variability in the record but never any state change.  No generalized slowing is present.   No focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile and auditory stimulation do not in any way activate the record.   EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 110 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal ICU bedside portable EEG due to: 1. Replacement of normal background with a diffuse, nonreactive alpha pattern  CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features. The overall pattern resembles an alpha coma.  These findings must be placed in appropriate clinical context. This EEG was recorded a little over 24 hours post injury. Ongoing comprehensive neurological assessment is suggested.
