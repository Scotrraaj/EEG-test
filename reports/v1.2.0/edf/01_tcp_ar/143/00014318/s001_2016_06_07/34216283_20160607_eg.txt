HISTORY:

66 y.o. male with a history of motorcycle accident 5/29 (unconscious on field,
GCS 9 on arrival), with resultant multicompartmental ICH, SAH, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, IVH),
referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.




MEDICATIONS: Dilaudid, Insulin, Lovenox, Lopressor, Metoprolol, Keppra, Famotidine, Ancef



SEDATION: meds as above


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous, symmetric, and reactive but poorly organized.  During periods where
the tech stimulates the patient, the background is characterized by poorly organized diffuse delta and
theta.




During periods of relative quiet, there is further slowing of the background, which becomes
predominantly delta activity with admixed theta.




There are no sleep transients captured.


Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

In comparison to the routine EEG performed 1 week ago, fewer faster frequencies are seen in the
background; the degree of generalized slowing is slightly worse.  The subtle intermittent asymmetry
between the hemispheres noted 1 week ago is not clearly present on this study.
