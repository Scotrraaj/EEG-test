DATE OF STUDY: 09/02/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only





HISTORY:

a 57 y.o. MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O NONTRAUMATIC SDH/ PEA CARDIC
ARREST. NOTED WITH LT DEVI.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) injection 5 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion


phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) suppository 650 mg

fentaNYL (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection 50 mcg


famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg





SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. Some reactivity
was seen.





Sleep is not captured


Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Mild to moderate generalized slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
