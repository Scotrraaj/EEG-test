HISTORY:

72 y.o. male with a history of alcoholism,

prior CVA referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal


events.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

HYDROcodone-acetaminophen (LORTAB) 7.5-500 mg per tablet, Take 1

tablet by mouth every 6 hours as needed.


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth

daily.


naproxen (NAPROSYN) 250 mg tablet, Take 250 mg by mouth 2 times

daily (with meals).

No seizure medicines reported.


SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG; portable record, no HV nor

photic.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is a bit slow but is  characterized by the


presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta

frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7.5 Hertz posterior

dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient

of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen. Most of the record is drowsiness


Sleep is characterized by a low voltage, slow pattern.



Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare (<1hour)  See below


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

A single Left temporal sharp wave was seen, but has the


morphology of a BET. It was followed by a generalized attenuation


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 104 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of a diffuse disorder of

cerebral function, non specific in nature. The single sharp wave


must be considered an artifact.
