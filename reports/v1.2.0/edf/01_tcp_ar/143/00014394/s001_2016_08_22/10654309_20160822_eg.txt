SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  This is a very
anxious patient.  In addition, there is a clear breach rhythm noted in the right frontocentral region
with market accentuation of beta activity in that area.  There is an amplitude accentuation
throughout the right hemisphere





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.






Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

Continuous focal slowing is present.  This is most remarkable in the right central temporal region but
there is more subtle rhythmic slowing throughout the right hemisphere



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1.  Continuous right focal slowing and right frontocentral region, in context of breach rhythm


2. Generous beta


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings  are frequently found in association with a structural abnormality.  No epileptiform
features were noted.  This is an awake record with, I relatively well organized background despite the
focal features
