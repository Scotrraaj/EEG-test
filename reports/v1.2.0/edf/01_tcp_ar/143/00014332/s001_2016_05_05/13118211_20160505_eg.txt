SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  The patient was awake, chewing on
her hands with a great deal of muscle and other artifact throughout the EEG




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by  a slow pattern symmetric mixture of alpha and beta
frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 5-7Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is excess beta, excess
theta, and also a great deal of muscle artifact.  The beta activity is quite prominent in the central
regions





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not achieved



Modest generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:



None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.




EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90-114 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. IRRG



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. generalized background slowing


2.  Excess beta


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific but support diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  There is a great
deal of muscle and twitch artifact.  If the patient is able to cooperate in the future, consider a
followup study to more clearly defined epileptiform activity
