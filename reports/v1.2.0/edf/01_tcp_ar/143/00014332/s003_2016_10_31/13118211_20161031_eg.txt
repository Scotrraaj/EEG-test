SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to temporalis muscle artifact throughout the record and A1 electrode artifact. It included a single
channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly symmetric mixture of alpha and
beta frequencies, with a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at best reached 9Hz . The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient is lost at times. There is excessive diffuse 5-7Hz activity seen in
wakefulness.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None





OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Mild diffuse slow waves and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine limited EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing
and disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
