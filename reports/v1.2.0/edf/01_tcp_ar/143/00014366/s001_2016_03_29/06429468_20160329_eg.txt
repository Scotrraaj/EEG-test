HISTORY:

60 y.o. Male PMH CVA in 2012, who

presented with cardiac arrest, s/p shocked in field x2, then


noted to be breathing spontaneously but not following commands

and hypothermia protocol was initiated. Patient now extubated and

at baseline. Now referred for routine EEG for characterization of


seizures; bystanders noted patient had seizure in field.


MEDICATIONS: HEPARIN, UNASYN, ASA, PLAVIX, PROTONIX,


ATROVASTATIN, AMLODIPINE, METOPROLOL, HYDRALAZINE, ISODRIL


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2




electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of

mostly beta range activity with occasional alpha, organized in a

normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is

characterized by a symmetric and reactive low voltage beta-range


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, and theta slowing

in the posterior leads emerge.  The patient is asked to open his

eyes and respond to questioning; theta waveforms in the posterior


leads develops a notched quality.  There is no clear evolution.

This is felt to represent a variant of drowsiness and/or slow


alpha variant.


Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION / CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an essentially normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.


There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or

detected.

A low voltage beta-range posterior dominant rhythm is a normal

adult variant.


Theta slowing in the posterior leads described above may

represent a normal drowsy variant and/or slow alpha variant.
