HISTORY:

74 y.o. male with a history of bacterial meningitis referred for routine EEG for
assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS: none listed



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and minimal beta frequencies, with excess of delta activity, with a symmetric and reactive 7.5
Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is present but suboptimal.





Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to:


1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing, with suboptimal organization

2. Tachycardia


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
Tachycardia is noted in a single EKG lead.
