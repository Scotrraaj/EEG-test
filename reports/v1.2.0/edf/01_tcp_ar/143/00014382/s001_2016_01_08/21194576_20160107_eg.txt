History:	32 year old woman with episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  Mild degree of excess polymorphic theta activity is captured.  Patient 
remains awake throughout the study.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse 
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
	No epileptiform discharges
	No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a mildly abnormal awake-only 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and 
disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral 
dysfunction.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If 
clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
