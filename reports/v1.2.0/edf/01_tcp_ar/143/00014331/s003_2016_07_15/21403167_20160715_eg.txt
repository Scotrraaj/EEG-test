HISTORY:

74 y.o. female with a history of SAH, s/p Ventriculostomy referred for EEG for
screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra, GBP



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with
T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and
included a single channel of EKG and seizure and spike detection.



DAY 1 ( 07/15/16- 7/16/2016, 06:00)




BACKGROUND:

The background is  continuous,  symmetric, and consists predominantly of  Theta with admixed delta.



Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.



The background is  reactive,  variable.


There were subtle  asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was not captured.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Few subtle frontal GPEDS, low to medium amplitude



EVENTS:


EKG: A single lead captured HR 80 with frequent PVC



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

Slow background.

Infrequent, simple GPEDS.



DAY 2 ( 07/16/16- 7/17/2016, 06:00)

Meds: Keppra and Vancomycin


BACKGROUND:

The background is  continuous,  Reasonably symmetric, and consists predominantly of  theta with
admixed delta and scant alpha.  There are eye movements. There is more alpha in day 2


Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.

The background is  reactive,  variable.

There were subtle  asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.


Sleep was better defined. Characterized by generalized slowing




PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Few subtle frontal GPEDS, low to medium amplitude

Rare left frontal sharp waves

EVENTS:



EKG: A single lead captured HR 72 with frequent PVC



DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

Slow background

Few GPEDS




-----------------------------------------------------------------



FINAL IMPRESSION:



This is abnnormal video EEG due to:


1. Markedly slow background, improving in day 2.

2.  Ocassional simple frontal GPEDS/ Triphasic waves


3. Rare left frontal sharp waves



FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with a bi-hemispheric disturbance of cerebral
function.The left frontal sharp waves may be correlated with imaging. No seizures were seen.
