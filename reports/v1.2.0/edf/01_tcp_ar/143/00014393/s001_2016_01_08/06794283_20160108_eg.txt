Description:
Duriing maximal arousal the background consists of fragmented low-to-moderate amplitude 7 Hz 
theta activity posteriorly, excess polymorphic theta and delta activity, brief bursts of diffuse delta 
activity and poor AP gradient.  Patient falls asleep but no normal sleep architecture is captured.
