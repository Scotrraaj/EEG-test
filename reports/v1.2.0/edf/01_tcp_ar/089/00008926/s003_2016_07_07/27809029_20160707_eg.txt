HISTORY:

27 y.o. female with a history of  Epilepsy, mental illness, TBI. Currently seizure free
and off seizure meds, 7 months pregnant. Now referred for routine EEG for characterization of
seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).

docusate sodium (COLACE) 100 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily as needed for
Constipation.

ranitidine (ZANTAC) 150 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

promethazine (PHENERGAN) 25 mg suppository, Place 1 suppository rectally every 8 hours as
needed for Nausea.


doxylamine (UNISOM) 25 mg Tablet, Take 1 po in am, 1 po at lunch and 2 po hs


Prenatal Multivit-Ca-Min-Fe-FA (PRENATAL VITAMIN) Tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

budesonide-formoterol (SYMBICORT) 160-4.5 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs 2
times daily.


montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation. There is sweat and electrode
artifact.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.7 70 uV Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements  are seen.


Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces  photic
driving, which is a normal finding.  Photic driving has a slightly asymmetric field.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
