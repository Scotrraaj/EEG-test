DATE OF STUDY: 01/18/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient







HISTORY:

a 28 y.o. female with a history of seizures, who is currently pregnant.  As per
EEG technologist, patient had an episode prior to starting this EEG recording consisting of staring
and drooling.





MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

PREPLUS 27 mg iron- 1 mg Tablet,

levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.


lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

ondansetron (ZOFRAN) 4 mg tablet,

trazodone (DESYREL) 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth nightly. Indications: Insomnia



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.






SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation x2.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Subtle occasional polymorphic theta activity is seen over the left anterior temporal region.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation x2: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not
produce additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Occasional mild left anterior temporal focal slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly
structural in origin.




No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
