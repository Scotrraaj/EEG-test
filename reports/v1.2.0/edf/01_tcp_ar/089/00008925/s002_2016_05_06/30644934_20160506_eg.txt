HISTORY:

33 y.o. MAN  WITH  ETOH WITHDRAWAL SEIZURES. HEAD TRAUMA  S/P EVAC
OF RIGHT SDH.  PRIOR EEG 2012



MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA, ATIVAN DRIP 2,  PROPOFOL DRIP 10, OFIRMEV, MORPHINE, PRN, HYDRALAZINE,
LABETALOL, ZOFRAN, ANCEF




SEDATION: See above.


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.




Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



There is reactivity to tactile and ocular stimulus.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 114 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate to severe diffuse slow waves


2. Excess beta


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to diffuse moderate to severe background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
