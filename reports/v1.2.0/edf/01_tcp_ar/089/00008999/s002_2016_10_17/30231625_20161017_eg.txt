HISTORY:

31 y.o. FEMALE WITH PMHX OF COMPLEX PARTIAL SZ SINCE THE AGE OF
16. LAST EPISODE ON 10/16/16



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

carBAMazepine (CARBATROL) 200 mg 12 hr capsule, Take 3 capsules by mouth 2 times daily for
360 days.


folic acid (FOLVITE) 1 mg tablet, Take 3 tablets by mouth daily.

PNV with calcium no.72-iron-FA (PRENATAL PLUS, CALCIUM CARB,) 27 mg iron- 1 mg Tablet,
Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


clonazePAM (KLONOPIN) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly as needed (insomnia).

minocycline (MINOCIN,DYNACIN) 100 mg capsule, Take 100 mg by mouth 2 times daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral mid-temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. At time the discharges appear to be sharply contoured but
no clearly epileptogenic in morphology.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
focal slowing in the bitemporal region




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is performed and does not cause any changes.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


1.  Intermittent focal slowing in the bitemporal region, at time very sharply contoured.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the
bitemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific.

A repeat EEG capturing sleep may be beneficial in capturing the focal slow waves and may help
elucidate epileptiform activity.
