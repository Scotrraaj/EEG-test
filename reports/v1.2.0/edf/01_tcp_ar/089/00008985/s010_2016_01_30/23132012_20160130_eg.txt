HISTORY: 56 y.o. female with a history of Parry-Romberg syndrome and intractable localization related epilepsy, referred for EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.  

MEDICATIONS: Keppra 1500 mg q12h Carbamazepine 400-300-400 *Note that patient was recently taken off VPA due to hyperammonemia  

SEDATION: None  

TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   

DAY 1 (1/29/2016, 18:12 - 1/30/2016, 06:00)  

BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, and fairly-organized.  The right hemisphere consists predominantly of alpha, beta and theta, with a posterior dominant rhythm of 7 Hz. The left hemisphere consists predominantly of delta and theta, with a posterior dominant rhythm that is less clearly visualized.  There is continuous left hemispheric slowing.  Patient remains awake the entire night.  

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Very frequent left fronto-temporal spike and wave (T1>T3/F3/Fp1 max) 2. Occasional right fronto-temporal spike and wave (Fp2/F4 > F8/T4 max)  

EVENTS:  Note that the patient cannot describe her seizures, state how frequent they are, or press the button when she experiences one.  1/30/2016 at 18:20, 18:29, 19:17, 20:23, 22:06, 22:40  1/31/2016 at 00:34, 02:10 x2, 02:40, 03:06, 03:28, 03:35, 03:51, 03:58, 04:26, 04:36, 05:03, 05:34, 05:48  - left hemispheric seizures  

CLINICAL: Body jerk. In some, there is subtle R hand twitching, then intermittent head jerking toward R, then side to side head movements. In some, chewing movements on the right are seen. For the 20:24 event, a caregiver notes, "twitching of the mouth" Other times, no clear clinical correlate is detectable. 

EEG: Increased rhythmicity and amplitude of delta rhythms over left temporal area. Some are preceded by 1 Hz spiking over the left fronto-temporal area. Duration is < 1 -2 min.   00:24 - unclear etiology  

CLINICAL: patient rhythmically moves left leg back and forth in plane of bed 

EEG: rhythmic delta in left hemisphere max over O1 corresponds to frequency of leg movements, but rhythms attenuate suddenly   

EKG: A single EKG lead was recording suboptimally   

DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal video long term study due to: 1. Mild generalized slowing with suboptimal organization 2. Continuous left hemispheric polymorphic slowing 3. Very frequent left fronto-temporal spike and wave (T1>T3/F3/Fp1 max) 4. Occasional right fronto-temporal spike and wave (Fp2/F4 > F8/T4 max) 5. Multiple left hemispheric seizures captured as described above, with a clinical correlate that was somewhat variable but often consisted of intermittent R hand twitching, R head jerking, or side-to-side head movements    

-----------------------------------------------------------------  

DAY 2 (1/30/2016, 06:00 - 1/31/2016, 08:14)  

BACKGROUND: No change in awake background. Sleep is captured on this day and consists of diffuse background slowing, but no sleep transients are seen.  

GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  

FOCAL SLOWING: No change  

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  

SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change  

EVENTS:   1/30/2016 at 06:04, 06:17, 06:23, 06:27, 06:43, 06:54, 07:21, 08:12, 09:56, 11:02, 12:30, 14:14, 15:42, 17:43, 18:01, 18:18, 18:13, 18:21, 18:28, 18:51, 19:13, 19:38, 19:44, 19:58, 20:11, 20:19, 20:35, 20:44, 21:09, 21:39, 21:50, 22:03, 22:09, 22:58  1/31/2016 at 00:12, 00:53, 01:41, 01:51, 01:59, 02:03, 02:08, 02:12, 02:22, 02:31, 02:37, 02:44, 02:55, 03:06, 03:09, 03:13, 03:21, 03:26, 03:31, 03:35, 03:39, 03:50, 04:00, 04:05, 04:09, 04:14, 04:23, 04:28, 04:37, 04:43, 04:58, 05:04, 05:16, 05:24, 05:33, 05:40, 05:51, 06:07, 06:09, 06:12, 06:14, 06:24, 06:26, 06:29, 06:32, 06:37, 06:43, 06:51, 06:53, 06:57, 07:05, 07:07, 07:10, 07:12, 07:19, 07:28, 07:59, 08:10   - left hemispheric seizures 

CLINICAL: similar to above. Body jerk. In some, there is subtle R hand twitching, then intermittent head jerking toward R, then side to side head movements. In some, chewing movements on the right are seen. Other times, no clear clinical correlate is detectable. For 1/30/2016 at 12:30 event, she has R arm jerking and decreased responsiveness, though is able to tell nurse she is having a seizure. Left hand is tremulous. Other times she is less responsive (1/30/2016 at 17:43) Note that for 18:01 seizure, patient moans, then raises her right arm antigravity, then stares. She then has intermittent nonrhythmic twitching of the right arm. Note that the moan and the raising up of the right arm occur before electrographic seizure onset on EEG, but the seizure otherwise evolves as the others do. In sleep, these discharges are associated with eye flutter. For the seizure at 07:28, the patient attends to the nurse and nods "yes" but is unable to speak. 

EEG: Increased rhythmicity and amplitude of delta rhythms over left temporal area. Some are preceded by 1 Hz spiking over the left fronto-temporal area. Duration is < 1 -2 min. Note that for the seizure on 1/30 at 21:09, a burst of 3 Hz generalized spike and wave appears for 1 second.   1/30/2016 at 10:52, 13:14 - events of unclear etiology  

CLINICAL: Patient has a body jerk and moans. Nurse uncovers her to find tremulous movements of left hand. Patient interacts, follows simple commands, but does not name. 

EEG: Diffuse attenuation of rhythms - unclear if alerting pattern or seizure   1/30/2016 at 12:33 - event of unclear etiology  

CLINICAL: nurse pushes button for decreased responsiveness. Patient is awake, but very slow to interact and follow commands. 

EEG: Diffuse attenuation of rhythms - unclear if alerting pattern or seizure   1/30/2016 at 18:06 - event of unclear etiology 

CLINICAL: while daughter is putting a brace on patient's right arm, patient moans and raises her right arm (note that this semiology appears very similar to 18:01 seizure described above). However, unlike the 18:01 seizure, patient does not proceed to have right arm/head jerking. EEG: There is no definite EEG cerebral correlate   1/30/2016 at 19:47 - event of unclear etiology 

CLINICAL: nurse pushes button because patient cannot state her name or follow a simple midline command EEG: there is no definite EEG correlate   

EKG: A single EKG lead was recording suboptimally   

DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Same as day 1.     

-----------------------------------------------------------------  

FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Mild generalized slowing with suboptimal organization 2. Continuous left hemispheric polymorphic slowing 3. Very frequent left fronto-temporal spike and wave (T1>T3/F3/Fp1 max) 4. Occasional right fronto-temporal spike and wave (Fp2/F4 > F8/T4 max) 5. Multiple left hemispheric (temporal max) seizures captured as described above, with a clinical correlate that was somewhat variable but often consisted of intermittent R hand twitching, R head jerking, or side-to-side head movements and decreased ability to speak 6. Multiple other episodes with variable clinical correlate that was sometimes similar to that associated with the patient's seizures, but that had no EEG correlate   

FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are diagnostic for focal epilepsy of left hemispheric (temporal max) origin.  There is additionally evidence for right frontotemporal epileptogenic potential.  Many episodes of decreased responsiveness +/- right arm movements were captured that appeared similar to the patient's semiology during her electrographic seizures, but were not associated with electrographic seizures.  The background findings are consistent with left hemispheric dysfunction that is likely structural in etiology superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
