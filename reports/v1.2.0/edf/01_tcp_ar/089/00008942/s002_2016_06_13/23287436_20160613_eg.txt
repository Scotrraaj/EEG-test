HISTORY:

67 y.o. WOMAN WHO PRESENTS WITH H/O DEMENTIA AND DEPRESSION .
PT DECREASE IN RESPONSIVENESS. PMHX.HTN,DEMENTIA,CVA L SIDE.



MEDICATIONS:


PROZAC




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



Excess 5-7 Hz activity is seen in wakefulness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Mild excess theta in wakefulness.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing  This
finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
