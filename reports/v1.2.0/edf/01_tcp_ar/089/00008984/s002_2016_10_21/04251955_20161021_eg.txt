HISTORY: 46 y.o. male with a history of AIDS, schizophrenia, seizure disorder, with most recent seizure 1 month ago, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.  MEDICATIONS: Current Outpatient Prescriptions: divalproex (DEPAKOTE DR) 500 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily. levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily for 360 days. multivitamin with minerals tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. Acetaminophen (MAPAP) 500 mg Capsule, Take 500 mg by mouth every 4 hours as needed. pravastatin (PRAVACHOL) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily for 360 days. PREZISTA 800 mg Tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily (with breakfast). emtricitabine-tenofovir (TRUVADA) 200-300 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. ritonavir (NORVIR) 100 mg Tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. Duloxetine (CYMBALTA) 30 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily. amlodipine-benazepril (LOTREL) 5-10 mg per capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily. Stop the amlodipine 5 and enalapril 10 sucralfate (CARAFATE) 1 gram tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily for 360 days. Give Tid as a slurry on an empty stomach Omega-3 Fatty Acids (FISH OIL CONCENTRATE) 1,000 mg Capsule, Take 2 capsules by mouth daily. 2 caps po in AM haloperidol (HALDOL) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily. Indications: Schizophrenia  No current facility-administered medications for this visit.    SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel 1-hour electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  EEG BACKGROUND: Wakefulness is characterized by symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Low amplitude anteriorly predominant beta activity is seen, with a large amount of superimposed muscle artifact.  Sleep is not captured  No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:        Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.       Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.   EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. During HV, frequent PVCs were noted.  IMPRESSION: This is a normal awake only 1-hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: A normal interictal EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
