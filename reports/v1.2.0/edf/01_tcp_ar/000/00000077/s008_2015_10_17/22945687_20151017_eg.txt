HISTORY:

39 y.o. male with a history of

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, recent hospitalization for EEG


monitoring that was terminated early at family request,

readmitted on 10/15 referred for routine EEG for characterization

of seizures.


Pt had tonic seizures with right head turning overnight and one

similar seizure

immediately before this test today.  This is a post-ictal EEG.



MEDICATIONS:

LamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL)


Zonisamide (ZONEGRAN)

Clobazam

? Rufinamide (BANZEL)


QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL)




QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL)



SEDATION: None reported by the technologist



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside  21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded

using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and

utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory


record and included a single channel of EKG. There was no photic

stimulation or hyperventilation for this bedside portable record.


The patient was somnolent. Tactile stimulation was performed

once.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The  background is markedly abnormal and is characterized by a

mixed frequency slow pattern with medium amplitude delta and


theta  There is  no posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is

absent in this somnolent individual.

There is frequent,1-4 Hz  frontally predominant spike and wave


activity, 13.7-15 Hz polys spike activity and rare bursts of

13-15 hz frontal beta



Sleep: patient is drowsy throughout


Generalized slowing is present.


No significant  focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: See above

Slow spike and wave

Frontal R or left S/W

GPFA


Polyspike and wave



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Sternal rub seems to ameliorate the spike and wave activity



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical  events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. Markedly abnormal background


2. Slow spike and wave activity

3. Polys spike and GPFA activity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings suggest a highly irritative pattern. They can be

seen as an interictal pattern in LGS, but should be evaluated in


the context of the patient's usual background and recent clinical

Events. The pattern of prolonged post ictal slowing was noted


during his recent inpatient video EEG recording of October 5,

2015.
