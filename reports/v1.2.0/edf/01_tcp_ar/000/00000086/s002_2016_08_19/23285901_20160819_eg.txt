HISTORY:

60 y.o. female with a history of medically refractory epilepsy, recently had 8
SPS, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 100 mg tablet, 2 tabs in AM, 1.5 in PM 200 in am and 150 in pm

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, 500 mg. In the A.M. And 1000 mg. In the p.m.


alendronate (FOSAMAX) 70 mg tablet,

multivitamin capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.

CALCIUM CARBONATE/VITAMIN D3 (CALCIUM+D PO), Take  by mouth. Unaware of dose




TECHNIQUE:








A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation. This is a technically challenging
record, with F7 artifact which persisted after the electrode was changed, and muscle artifact.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There is excess
theta, the overall background is somewhat poorly organized.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep includes beta and spindles.



Mild  generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No definitive spikes or sharps, artifact only.

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: not done


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a technically challenging but abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:




1. Mild excess theta and disorganization.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Given the artifacts in the F7 electrode, no definitive spikes or sharps can be identified in that region.


The  Findings of excess theta are nonspecific. Given the frequency of seizures, EEG monitoring was
suggested.
