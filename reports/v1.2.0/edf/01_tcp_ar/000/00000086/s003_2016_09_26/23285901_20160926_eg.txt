PT DESCRIBES SIMPLE PARTIAL AND COMPLEX PARTIAL SZ'S. AS MANY AS 6 A WEEK.




MEDICATIONS:

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.


Facility-Administered Medications Ordered in Other Visits:

calcium-vitamin D 500 mg(1,250mg) -200 unit per tablet 1 tablet

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) tablet 150 mg


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 500 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg








SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral fronto temporal (right more than left)
regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent right fronto temporal sharp waves.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



1.  Frequent right fronto temporal sharp waves.


2.  Intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral fronto temporal (right more than left) region


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to frequent right fronto temporal sharp waves
which is indicative of a focal epileptogenic focus in that region and consistent with the diagnosis of
localization related epilepsy. In addition there is intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral fronto
temporal (right more than left) region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which
is etiologically non-specific. No seizures were seen.
