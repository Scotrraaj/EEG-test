HISTORY:

64 YR MAN WITH CC OF HIGH SUGAR (500'S) AND CHANGE IN MS.
Â SEIZURES, including one on 5/3/2-16. Prior LTM.



MEDICATIONS:

DILANTIN, KEPPRA, ISORDIL, INSULIN, CLONIDINE, ASA, AMLODIPINE, METOPROLOL,
HEPARIN

Vimpat was added


SEDATION: Ativan



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.  This is bedside EEG monitoring with seizure and spike
detection software. The patient was very restless, picking at EEG leads.



_________________________________________


Day 1 May 4-5 2016

EEG BACKGROUND:



No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  The background is variable, and as recording continues, it is a low voltage theta pattern



Sleep is limited, but includes some beta and a low voltage pattern.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


Focal slow: underneath the arrtifact, there is probably R temporal focal slowing in sleep.


ARTIFACTS: L sided noted at 10 PM, with Left occipital delta but double phase reversing artifacts at
that time


EVENTS: no clinical events

EKG: A single EKG lead captured 50-72 BPM




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

Slow background, no seizures.  Recording at times limited by artifacts.


-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 2 (May 5, 06:00 - 5/06/2016, 06:00)

MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA, Vimpat

BACKGROUND: At times more wake,with discernable, reactive PDR. Sleep with POSTs and spindles
noted on the 6th



GENERALIZED SLOWING: resolving



FOCAL SLOWING: None



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected. He has a headache once and
some odd behavior.






EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR reg 72 BPM



DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

No seizures, overall  Background improving.




-----------------------------------------------------------------



FINAL IMPRESSION:


This is abnormal video EEG due to:



1. initially slow and disorganized pattern.

2. Initial absence of some of the normal wave forms of sleep.


3. Remarkable for some artifacts on the left on May 4 which could have obscured subtle seizures from
the left at 9-10 PM but not of his usual 2-4 Min CPS which are characterized by chewing, coughing
and loss of awareness.



FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the resolution of this patient's exacerbation of epilepsy or seizure cluster.  At
the end of the recording, the overall background had improved. There was a paucity of interictal
discharges.
