HISTORY:

64 YR MAN WITH CC OF HIGH SUGAR (500'S) AND CHANGE IN MS.
PMHX: SEIZURES.



MEDICATIONS:

DILANTIN, KEPPRA, ISORDIL, INSULIN, CLONIDINE, ASA, AMLODIPINE, METOPROLOL,
HEPARIN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.






Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There is a single seizure during the record lasting about 3.5 minutes.



Clinically: (no audio was available) the technician states that the patient repeated the word

The video shows the patient staring with some mouth movements.



EEG: There rhythmic theta buildup, broadly distributed over the left temporal chain that slows in
frequency to delta, while increasing in amplitude. This ictal activity remains over the temporal region
and settles at 3 Hz in the mid to anterior temporal region.  There is no definite focal
attenuation/slowing postictally.




EKG: no change in HR




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake routine EEG due to:


1. Single left temporal seizure.

2. Generalized slow waves, Moderate



CLINICAL CORRELATION:









These findings demonstrate epileptogenicity of left temporal origin, with a single  seizure captured
during this EEG. A prior long term EEG performed in 11/2015 and routine EEG yesterday also
demonstrated left temporal seizures. There is additional evidence during this study for
moderatediffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. These findings were known to the
treatment team.
