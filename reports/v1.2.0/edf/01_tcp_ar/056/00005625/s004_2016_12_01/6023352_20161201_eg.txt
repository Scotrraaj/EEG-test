HISTORY:

40 y.o. female with a history of lifelong CPS, depression, referred for routine EEG
for characterization of seizures.


CPS with automaticsms, picking at things, slightly confused prior CPS with an aura of the air smelling
dry, then visual phenomena, then tingling in legs.


MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL XR) 400 mg 12 hr tablet, TAKE ONE TABLET 2 TIMES A DAY

citalopram (CELEXA) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.


ZOLPIDEM TARTRATE (AMBIEN PO), Take  by mouth.

PSEUDOEPHEDRINE HCL (SUDAFED PO), Take  by mouth.

FLUTICASONE/SALMETEROL (ADVAIR HFA IN), Inhale  into the lungs.


TECHNIQUE:

A  1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HVand photic stimulation.
There were electrode issues




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive  9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

Shifting, R temporal focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Sharply contoured slowing is noted in the transition to sleep


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  R TIRDA- as the patient becomes drowsy




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Was performed as the patient was drifting off to sleep.  Although there is a fair
amount of EKG artifact, there is both generalized background slowing and some sharply contoured
focal slowing noted in the right temporal region



Photic Stimulation: was unsuccessful


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. R focal slowing with R Temporal TIRDA and some irregular slowing


2. R sharply contoured slowing.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:




These findings support a structural process in the right temporal region, congruent with imaging.  The
sharply contoured slowing supports a focal mechanism for seizures.  These findings may be
correlated with previous studies
