SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.






Sleep stage I-II is captured



Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the T3 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic stimulation does not produce any changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Occasional focal slowing in the left midtemporal region.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to occasional focal slowing in the left
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.
