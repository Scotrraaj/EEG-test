HISTORY:

63 y.o. male admitted with hypoglycemia, found to have occipital CVA and
anoxic changes on MRI, now with stimulus induced jerking of leg and abdomen referred for routine
EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.

Vec briefly

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A portable  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile/ verbal stimulation.
The patient had multiple episodes of trunk and leg twitching during the EEG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The  background is characterized by the presence of a  symmetric mixture of 4-5 Hz theta and 2 Hz
delta  frequencies, without  a symmetric and reactive Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The
normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is absent.





Marked generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Stimulation of the patient does not impact the EEG

EVENTS:


There are clinical events captured during this study.

1. Multiple episodes of twitching without EEG change were recorded

HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 71 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal ICU COMA only  routine EEG due to:


1. Slow, relatively invariant background

2. Episodes of twitching without EEG change



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with anoxic or hypoglycemic insult. The overall
background is a bit more vigorous than the first studies on admission, but remains markedly
abnormal.
