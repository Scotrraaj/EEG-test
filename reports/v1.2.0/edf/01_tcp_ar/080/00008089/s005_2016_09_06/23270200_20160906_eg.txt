DATE OF STUDY: 09/06/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, coma study





HISTORY:

a 63 y.o. male admitted with hypoglycemia, found to have occipital CVA and
anoxic changes on MRI, recent with stimulus induced jerking of leg and abdomen (no EEG
correlate), now re-referred for routine EEG as a follow up study.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 20 Units

ampicillin-sulbactam (UNASYN) 3 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB MB+

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg


niCARdipine (CARDENE) 20 mg in NaCl (iso-os) 200 mL infusion

amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units




dextrose 50% injection 25 mL

dextrose 50% injection 50 mL


glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units


pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg


SEDATION: received 2 mg Ativan during study



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record
due to near continuous muscle artifact (tech notes patient bites down). The study included a single
channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:


Nearly the entire study is limited due to continuous muscle artifact. During brief periods of relaxation,
the background is continuous, symmetric, and consists of disorganized delta and alpha. There is no
posterior dominant rhythm. There is no definite reactivity, variability, or state change, though
assessment of these features is difficult in setting of muscle artifact. Administration of Ativan 2 mg at
15:31 does not affect muscle artifact.




Severe generalized slowing is present.


No definite focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal, very technically limited, coma study portable EEG due to:


1. Severe generalized slowing and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
