History:	56 year old woman with a history of seizures as a result of right MCA stroke requiing 
	craniectomy.
Medications:	Neurontin, keppra, valium
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.  The 
background over the left consists of moderate amplitude 10 -10.5 Hz alpha activity with expected 
AP gradient.  The bakcground over the right consists of polymorphic 8.5-9.5 Hz alpha activity with 
poor AP gradient.  Additionally, voltages are lower over the right with poymorphic theta and delta 
activity especially pronounced over the right temporal region.  Diffuse excess beta activity is 
captured.  During brief drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and diffuse theta 
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, especially temporal region
	Beta, excessive
	No epileptiform discharges
	No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy EEG due to continuous focal slowing over the right
 that is especially pronounced over the right temporal region. This finding is indicative of a focal 
structural lesion in this region.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, 
such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep 
was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
