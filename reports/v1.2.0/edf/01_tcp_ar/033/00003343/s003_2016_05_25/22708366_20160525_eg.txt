HISTORY:

77 y.o. male with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


ASCENSIA CONTOUR Strip,

glipizide (GLUCOTROL) 5 mg tablet,

LEVEMIR 100 unit/mL injection,


HUMALOG KWIKPEN 100 unit/mL Insulin Pen,

SURE COMFORT PEN NEEDLE 31 gauge x 5/16" Needle,

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth daily.

aspirin 81 mg chewable tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.







SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Diffuse excess beta activity is present.



During brief drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:




There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  Rare premature QRS complexes are seen.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and briefly drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic
events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and briefly  drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
