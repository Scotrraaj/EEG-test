HISTORY:

57 y.o. male with a history of seizures, referred for routine EEG to evaluate for
abnormal brain activity in anticipation of possible medication reduction.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 250 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily.

ABILIFY 5 mg tablet,


sertraline (ZOLOFT) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth daily.

tamsulosin (FLOMAX) 0.4 mg 24 hr capsule, Take 0.4 mg by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by a large amount of generalized very low amplitude 20-30
Hz activity. A moderate amount of low amplitude symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR) is also seen and attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, attenuation of posterior dominant rhythm and diffuse background slowing are
seen.


Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:





This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
