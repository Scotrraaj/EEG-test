No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.







Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) F7/T3 sharp waves with a broad field are seen.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Left fronto-temporal sharp waves

2. Frequent left temporal slow waves


3. Excess beta




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to frequent left fronto-temporal sharp waves
and temporal focal slowing.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability,
which has high correlation with localization related epilepsy arising form this region. Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
