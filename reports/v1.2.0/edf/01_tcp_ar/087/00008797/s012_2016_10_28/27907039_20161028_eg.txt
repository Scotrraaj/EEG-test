HISTORY: This is a 63 y.o. right handed male admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring with a history of: refractory epilepsy. Duration 30 years, currently no TC but intermittent loss of awareness. OSA on CPAP. His two siblings also had epilepsy, one of whom died of epilepsy.  Continuous video EEG is initiated for: Recording of seizures for presurgical evaluation. Seizure semiology: 1. Lapses of time- staring episodes, not aware. Current frequency unknown has not noticed. It is not clear if he has any events while on PHT. 2. Convulsions. Odd feeling. Not enough time to get in the same position. Current frequency: every 3-5 years. Seizure semiology:  Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons: - The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and morbidity risk. Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options. If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate. - Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus; - The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures; - The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient’s exam There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service  CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring. The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system. Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case. Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms. EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive. Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail. Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior. For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24 hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician. A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day. The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing. During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance. The spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges. Samples of EEG were recorded periodically. Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist. All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. Sleep deprivation not possible. EKG: A single EKG lead captured 78 BPM DAY 6 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION No epileptiform features, no events despite several days at low levels of medicines. The record demonstrates infrequent temporal slowing, not out of the range of normal for age. The patient suffers from Obstructive sleep apnea, demonstrates fragmented sleep at night and frequent daytime naps.   

INDUCTION PROCEDURES: Had no impact Photic stimulation Hyperventilation  

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:  Interictal Findings: Two sharp waves, left frontal /left frontotemporal  Ictal Findings:  The patient had ZERO clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy monitoring unit. Extremely rare epileptiform features were noted but no events despite several days at low levels of medicines  The record demonstrates infrequent temporal slowing, not out of the range of normal for age. The patient suffers from Obstructive sleep apnea, demonstrates fragmented sleep at night and frequent daytime naps. 

SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:  1. Lifelong epilepsy with paucity of interictal findings to clarify the precise mechanism for seizures 2. Underlying sleep disorder 3. Cognitive impairment with MOCA score = 22  EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:  1. Epilepsy, but mechanism not well defined by this study. Likely focal mechanism  

CONCLUSION:  This gentleman was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 7 days with continuous video EEG. This was an EMU monitoring session because of concerns that he was having frequent events  The interictal EEG is normal for age. The patient was weaned down from the outpatient seizure medicines over the course of the admission. He was restarted on his medication on the day prior todischarge from the hospital. No other medication changes were made during the hospitalization.  Because of the daytime sleepiness, of which the patient did not seem to be aware, the current confusion spells may represent microsleeps.  The patient will follow-up with at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
