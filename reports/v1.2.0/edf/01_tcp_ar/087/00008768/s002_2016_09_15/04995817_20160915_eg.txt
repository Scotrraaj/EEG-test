DATE OF STUDY: 09/15/16 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:  EEG TYPE: 2.5 hours intra-op 9:38AM -12:04   HISTORY: a 70 y.o. female with a history of Right carotid stenosis referred for intra-operative  EEG for monitoring of cerebral function.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: lactated ringers infusion HYDROmorphone (DILAUDID) injection 0.5 mg allopurinol (ZYLOPRIM) tablet 100 mg aspirin (BAYER) tablet 325 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg carvedilol (COREG) tablet 12.5 mg colchicine (COLCRYS) tablet 0.6 mg famotidine (PEPCID) tablet 20 mg losartan (COZAAR) tablet 100 mg amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 5 mg oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet 1 tablet dextrose 5 % and sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion morphine injection 2 mg OR meds: Propofol, fentanyl, vecuronium, lidocaine, versed  TECHNIQUE: A  Digital  21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system standard carotid endarterectomy montage and one channel EKG. EEG WAS MONITORED WITH PHYSICIAN OUTSIDE OF THE OR AND REMOTE REVIEW BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   Procedure: With induction of anesthesia, the background becomes slower.  There are bursts of shifting slowing noted in either hemisphere. After 10 AM the record is briefly attenuating.  There is some shifting slowing noted from either hemisphere, prior to the incision at 10:33. Heparin was given at 11:04 The carotid was clamped at 11:08.  No focal changes were noted. Calmp was removed at 11:53. No changes were noted EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of  60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION: EEG monitoring during this right carotid endarterectomy did not identify significant focal features with placement of clamp.  These findings were reported to the operative team during the procedure Attending Epileptologist:
