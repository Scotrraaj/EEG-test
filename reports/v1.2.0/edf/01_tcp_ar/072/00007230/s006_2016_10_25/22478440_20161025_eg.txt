HISTORY:

57 y.o. male with a history of medically refractory epilepsy, significant bilateral
ischemic cerebrovascular disease, question of encephalitis in the past.  Seizure-free for 6 years,
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  The patient is somewhat
nervous and there is a fair amount of muscle artifact noted in the background




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of 6 Hz theta, alpha and a
moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a more or less symmetric and reactive 6 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Generous beta is noted in the
background



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, diffuse beta and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not sustained


Mild  generalized slowing is present.  Shifting focal slowing is present- irregular delta is noted on the
right, and the alpha rhythm is disrupted on the left.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:    Photic Stimulation: Scant driving is appreciated



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG.


1.  Background slowing and disorganization

2.  Shifting slowing




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is routine EEG is somewhat disorganized, but there are no epileptiform discharges.  The focal
features may be correlated with imaging


This routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
