History:	33 year old man with a history of seizures since 2008.
Medications:	Dilantin Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely. Patient rapidly transitions in and out of drowsiness throughout the study.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
heart rate <60 bpm.
