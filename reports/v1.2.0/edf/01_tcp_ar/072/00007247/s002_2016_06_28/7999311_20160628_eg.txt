DATE OF STUDY: 06/28/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy



HISTORY:

a 34 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


phenytoin (DILANTIN EXTENDED) 100 mg ER capsule, 2 capsules po bid for seizure prevention


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but
suboptimal at times.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. Rarely a burst of quasi-rhythmic delta
slowing at 2 Hz is seen.




Sleep is not captured



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and
produces trains of 2.5-3 Hz bilaterally synchronous slow waves, without any clearly associated
epileptiform features. There is no obvious clinical change on video review but the patient is not
tested.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing with suboptimal organization and rare bursts of 2 Hz quasi-rhythmic delta
slowing in drowsiness




CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.




Attending Epileptologist:

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
