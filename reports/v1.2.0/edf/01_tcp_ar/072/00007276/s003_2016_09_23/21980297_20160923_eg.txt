LAST YR.  PRESENTS WITH SZ LAST WK, FALL ON FACE GTC/ WITH LOC.  (WAS NOT ON
MEDS)


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide (PRINZIDE,ZESTORETIC) 20-25 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth
daily.


ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 800 mg tablet, Take 800 mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed.

simvastatin (ZOCOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth nightly.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION

1. Occasional focal slowing in the right midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to occasional focal slowing in the right
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.
