History:	61 year old man who presents with a syncopal event.
Medications:	no AEDs listed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm reaches polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude 8 Hz theta activity.
  The AP gradient is weak.  Diffuse excess theta activity is present.  During brief drowsiness, the 
degree of diffuse theta activity increases.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates 
regular heart rate.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
	No epileptiform discharges
	No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy portable EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This 
finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  A single
 EKG lead demonstrates regular heart rate.
