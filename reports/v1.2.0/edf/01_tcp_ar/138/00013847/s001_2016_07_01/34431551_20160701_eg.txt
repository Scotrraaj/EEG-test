HISTORY:

53 y.o. MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P PEA CODE X 2 DOWN TIME
UNKNOWN, S/P HYPOTHERMIA PROTOCOL.



MEDICATIONS:


EPINEPHRINE, NOREPINEPHRINE, DOPAMINE, LEVOPRESSIN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse very low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen.


There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or
tactile stimuli.




Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



1. Severe generalized slow waves and attenuation


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and
attenuation.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
