 HISTORY: 53 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P PEA CODE X 2 DOWN TIME UNKNOWN, S/P HYPOTHERMIA PROTOCOL.  MEDICATIONS: VASOPRESSIN, NOREPINEPHRINE, EPINEPHRINE  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (07/01/2016, 16:48 - 7/2/2016, 08:00)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse very low voltage delta to almost complete attenuation of activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen.   There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli.  Sleep is not captured  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.   DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Severe diffuse slowing and attenuation, no clear electro-cerebral activity is seen.  -------------------------------------------------------------- DAY 2 (07/02/2016, 08:00 - 7/3/2016, 08:00)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present.   The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen.   There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording.  This EEG was not performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.  There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli.  Sleep is not captured  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Severe diffuse attenuation, no clear electro-cerebral activity is seen.  -------------------------------------------------------------- DAY 3 (07/03/2016, 08:00 - 7/4/2016, 10:53)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present.   The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen.   There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording.  This EEG was not performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.  There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli.  Sleep is not captured EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.   DAY 3 IMPRESSION  This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Electro-cerebral silence.   CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is consistent with, but not diagnostic of, cerebral death.
