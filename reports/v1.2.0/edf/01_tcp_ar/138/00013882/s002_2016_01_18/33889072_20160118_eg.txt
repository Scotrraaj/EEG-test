DATE OF STUDY: 01/18/2016 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: Intraoperative    HISTORY: a 71 y.o. RH Woman HERE TO FOR PTE,TEE,EEG  PMHX: HTN  MEDICATIONS: ETOMIDATE, FENTANYL, VERSED, VECURONIUM, ISOFLURANE , PHENYLEPHRINE  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   During the record the background progresively slow down in frequency and decreases in amplitude. A symmetric burst suppression pattern is seen and some diffuse sharply contoured discharges can be seen. This continues until diffuse suppresion is seen. This is communicated to the team. As the patient is re-warmed the background slowly becomes more continuous but remains mainly composed of diffuse symmetric theta/ delta activity.   9:38:35 AM BYPASS, 9:57:04 AM  COOLING STARTS, 10:29:25 AM suppresion achieved, 12:02:35 PM rewarming commences.  Sleep is not captured  No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: No seizures were seen.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an uneventful intraoperative 7 hour EEG during cardiopulmonary surgery.   Attending Epileptologist:  I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
