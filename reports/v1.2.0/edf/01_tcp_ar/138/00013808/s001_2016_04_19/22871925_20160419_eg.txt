HISTORY:

69 y.o. male with a history of COPD, on

dialysis, lung transplant, admitted for surgery, referred for


routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.


MEDICATIONS: FENTANYL, ZOYVOX, HEPARIN, NOREPI, VERSED, PHENYL,


DILANTIN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The background consists of very low amplitude delta activity with


occasional bursts of diffuse sharply contoured diffuse alpha

activity occurring every 15-35 seconds. The latter is not clearly


cerebral in origin and although no source of artifact can be

identified by video review, this possibility cannot be entirely

excluded.



There is no reactivity to noxious stimulation, nor is there

variability or state change. There is no posterior dominant


rhythm. Sleep transients are not captured.


There is severe diffuse slowing.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

An irregular heart rate in the 130s is captured on a single EKG

lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:


1. Severe diffuse slowing, with no clear

reactivity/variability/state change, and background


disorganization

2. An irregular tachyarrhythmia noted on a single EKG lead



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe

diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may at least in part be due

to a medication effect.

An irregular tachyarrhythmia is noted on a single EKG lead.
