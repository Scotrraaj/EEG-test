HISTORY: 31 y.o. female with a history of HIV, Hospital meningitis.  Now with confusion and ocular bobbing referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.  MEDICATIONS: Not provided   SEDATION:  Ativan   TECHNIQUE: A Bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal Stimulation.  There is a fair amount of muscle artifact and the background  EEG BACKGROUND: The background is a challenging pattern.  The patient appears to be awake, there is often a mixed frequency slow pattern with excess theta.  Intermittently, an 11 Hz alpha rhythm is identified.  There is generous beta noted in the background.  When the patient starts to become drowsy, the EEG becomes a more synchronous and organized Generalized slowing is present.   No focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Verbal stimulation elicits an alerting response EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to: 1. background slowing and disorganization 2. excess theta  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are frequently found in association with a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or other diffuse disturbance is of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were identified.  Although the patient was agitated, she was consolable and at that time the EEG was a bit better organized.  Given the concerns of recent seizures today, EEG monitoring will follow that study
