HISTORY:

33 y.o. female with a history of seizures referred for routine EEG for evaluation of
paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: lorazepam


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:





As the record opens, and throughout the record there are epochs of muscle activity that obscure the
background. When this activity ceases, the background activity is attenuated and exhibits only diffuse
low voltage beta activity.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. At 12:49:12PM, lorazepam is given
intravenously and causes further suppression of the background.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study. However, the epochs of
muscle artifact obscure the record so no judgment cn be made during these epochs.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Diffuse amplitude attenuation



CLINICAL CORRELATION:




These findings indicate an effect of benzodiazepine sedation. No clinical or electrographic seizures
were seen.
