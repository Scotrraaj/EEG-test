History:	51 year old man with a history of childhood seizures that stopped at the age of 9 
	years old. He now had 2 episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During  drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves 
appear diffusely.  Additionally, bursts of bitemporal polymorphic theta and delta activity, R>L, are 
Occasional independent polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the left anterior 
temporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal 
slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per 
second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
	No epileptiform discharges
	No stage 2 sleep
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (R>L) temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 32-minute awake and drowsy EEG due to intermittent bitemporal focal 
slowing, most pronounced over the right anterior temporal region. This finding is indicative of focal 
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No 
epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, 
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
