HISTORY:

54 y.o. male with a history of a recent cardiac surgery, who currently remains
unresponsive.



MEDICATIONS:


Fentanyl stopped <24 hours ago




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.



For the majority of the recording, the background consists of a mixture of low amplitude polymorphic
theta and alpha activity with underrding delta activity.




With stimulation, the background briefly changes and there is an increase in faster activities.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal comatose portable EEG due to:

1. Moderate diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
