HISTORY:

50 y.o. male with a history of a recent L MCA stroke with hemorrhagic conversion.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.



The background over the right consists of 8.5 Hz alpha activity posteriorly with expected AP gradient.



The background over the left consists of unstable posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 7.5 Hz, poor
AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient, diffuse polymorphic theta and delta activity that are especially
prominent over the left temporal - temporoparietal region.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Continuous mild-to-moderate focal left hemispheric slowing that is especially pronounced over the
left temporal - temporoparietal region.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the left and is consistent with a
known recent left MCA stroke.
