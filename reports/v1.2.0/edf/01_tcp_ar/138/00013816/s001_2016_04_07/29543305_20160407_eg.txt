HISTORY:

24 y.o. male with a history of cognitive delay,

who has episodes of rapid mood fluctuations, concerning for


seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL ALLERGY) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by

mouth nightly as needed for Sleep.


benztropine (COGENTIN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth 2 times

daily.

risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) 1 mg tablet, Take 0.5 mg by mouth 2 times


daily.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.







SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10-10.5


Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



Frequent eye blinking artifact is present.


Patient remains awake throughout  the study.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~100 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical

or electrographic events reported or detected.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.

Frequent blinking artifact limits somewhat EEG interpretation,

since subtle slowing (especially anterior slowing) could be

missed.
