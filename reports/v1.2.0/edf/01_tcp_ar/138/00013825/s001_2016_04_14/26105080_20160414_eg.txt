HISTORY:

74 y.o. male with a history of DEMENTIA . CC OF

CHANGE IN MS, URESEPSIS, RENAL FAILURE, RESP FAILURreferred for


routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.


MEDICATIONS:


VANCOMYCIN, HEPARIN, PROTONIX, AMIODIPINE, NEURONTIN, RISPERDAL,

LISINOPRIL, othres



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A bedside portable ICU Digital Video 21 channel

electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International

10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system.


This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single




channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The overall background is medium amplitude with a continuous


pattern of relatively rhythmic theta and smaller amounts of

delta.  Triphasic waves are noted in the background.  Most of

frontally predominant.  A few are more posteriorly predominant in

the right hand full of right temporal phase reversals.


Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting more of a lower

voltage theta pattern and a limitation of the triphasic waves.



Where arousals with grimacing were noted.

Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


See above only


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Triphasic waves



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: See above



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96  Bpm, irreg is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal ICU EEG due to:


1. generalized background slowing

2. triphasic waves


3. Sharply contoured background.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with a


metabolic encephalopathy including renal insufficiency or hepatic

failure although they are nonspecific.  No seizures were


recorded.  There is clear reactivity and variability in the EEG
