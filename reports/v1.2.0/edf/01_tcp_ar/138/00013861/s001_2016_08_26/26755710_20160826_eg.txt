TECHNIQUE:

A STAT bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal  stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a  symmetric mixture of theta andsmaller
amounts of delta frequencies, without a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation  and diffuse increase background slowing
are seen.



Sleep - deeper stages not well defined



Moderate generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:




None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is  reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, and noxious stimuli.


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal STAT portable EEG due to:

1. Generalized slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with post ictal state or use of sedative medications.
There were no seizures recorded.
