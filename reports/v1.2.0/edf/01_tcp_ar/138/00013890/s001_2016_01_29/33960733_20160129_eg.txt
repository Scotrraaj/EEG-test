HISTORY:

a 74 y.o. FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O BREAST CA, S/P

B/L MASTECTOMY, DM AND ASTHMA. PRESENTED TO OSH ON 1/17/16 FOR


NAUSEA-VOMITING AND 3 DAY OLD BURN TO RT HAND AND LEG WHILE THERE

PT HAD 1 NEW ONSET SZ. FAMILY NOTED INCREASING CONFUSION.



MEDICATIONS:

NO AEDs



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

intermittent poorly organized symmetric mixture of mainly


frontocentral alpha and beta frequencies, with a slow 6 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior

gradient of frequency and amplitude is seen at times.  Mainly the

background activity is predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz


activity.

Rare brief (2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic


bifrontal slow waves were seen (frontal intermittent rhythmic

delta activity).


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 126 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate diffuse slow.


2. FIRDA



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to moderate

diffuse background slowing, FIRDA and slow alpha rhythm. These

findings are indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction,


which is etiologically nonspecific.
