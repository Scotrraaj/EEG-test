DATE OF STUDY: 05/17/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 38 y.o. female with a history of mild, epilepsy, migraine, anxiety and depression
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet, Take 750 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

multivitamin capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.

CALCIUM ACETATE PO, Take  by mouth.


ferrous sulfate 220 mg (44 mg iron)/5 mL solution,

alprazolam (XANAX) 1 mg tablet,

paroxetine (PAXIL) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth every morning.


VENLAFAXINE HCL (EFFEXOR PO), Take  by mouth.

VENTOLIN HFA 90 mcg/actuation inhaler,

carbamazepine (TEGRETOL) 100 mg/5 mL suspension, Take  by mouth 4 times daily.


OMEPRAZOLE PO, Take  by mouth.

RANITIDINE HCL PO, Take  by mouth.




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  The patient is in stage II sleep
for most of the EEG



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
