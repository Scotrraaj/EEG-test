HISTORY:

53 y.o. male referred from an outside hospital after 3 seizures for routine
EEG for characterization of seizures.  Now agitated



MEDICATIONS:


ATIVAN, VERSED, KEPPRA




SEDATION: see above


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.2-10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is
excess beta and mild excess theta noted in the background




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is scant but includes brief spindles



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Regular

IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Excess theta

2. Mild disorganizatin



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with a post ictal state, following use of sedative
medications, or other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were identified
