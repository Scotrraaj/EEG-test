DATE OF STUDY: 05/11/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 52 y.o. male with a history of traumatic brain injury.




MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:






The waking background is characterized by the presence of moderate amplitude polymorphic 7.5-8
Hz theta activity with poor AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient and excess diffuse polymorphic theta
and, less frequent, delta activity.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding is indicative of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.
