DATE OF STUDY: 04/28/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 60 min - 3 hr, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 61 y.o. male with a history of recent diagnosis of seizures referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


mirtazapine (REMERON) 15 mg tablet, Take 15 mg by mouth nightly.

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times daily. Indications: seizure

betamethasone dipropionate 0.05 % ointment, Apply twice a day as needed for rash


alendronate (FOSAMAX) 70 mg tablet,

amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet,

hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 25 mg tablet,


hydroxychloroquine (PLAQUENIL) 200 mg tablet,

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 600 mg tablet,

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 25 mg tablet,


pravastatin (PRAVACHOL) 40 mg tablet,

sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (BACTRIM DS) 800-160 mg per tablet,



betamethasone dipropionate 0.05 % ointment, Apply twice a day to rash on hands and feet

ketoconazole (NIZORAL) 2 % cream,



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation. The prior EEG was not available for
comparison.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.2 Hertz 35 uV posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
There is a small amount of background theta noted.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. In drowsiness there are bursts of shifting
irregular theta, L>R.



Sleep is limited, includes vertex waves and arousals.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No sustatined focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.





Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Shifting temporal slowing, L>R outside of the range of normal for a subject of this age.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are non specific but are frequently found in association with cerebrovascular disease.
