DATE OF STUDY: 04/05/2016

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 61 y.o. MAN WITH NEW ONSET SZ JAN 20TH. .



MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

poorly organized mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and


amplitude is present.  There is excessive diffuse theta frequency

discharges present in wakefulness.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the

bilateral midtemporal regions during wakefulness, increasing


during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral midtemporal

regions


2. Excess theta in wakefulness



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These finding are indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction and

mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which are both non-specific

with regards to etiology.
