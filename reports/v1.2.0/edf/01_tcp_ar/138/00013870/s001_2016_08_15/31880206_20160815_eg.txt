HISTORY:

Patient is a 49 y.o. right handed man presents with 2 episodes of nocturnal left arm jerking and 2
episodes of generalized convulsions for 4 months.




Seizure types:

Type 1: At night time, he had left arm jerk, hit himself in face and wakes up with tongue bite and
bleeding. Started in April 2016. So far he had 2 nocturnal episodes.





Type 2: Tonic clonic seizure for few minutes followed by confusion for 15-30 minutes. No aura
symptoms. He had 2 of these episodes in last 4 months.







He takes Xanax twice a day to help him sleep because of shift work with his job. He took Xanax the
morning of the event on 5/17/16 and 07/03/16.




Current AEDs:


Topiramate 50 mg q12h



Prior AEDs: None.




Seizure Risk factors:

Mother was in mental facility when she was pregnant and was on medications.


No head trauma, febrile seizures, infections, developmental delay, drug and alcohol abuse, family
history of seizures..

He uses xanax twice a day.




Headaches started about 4 months ago. It is a bifrontal throbbing pain that lasts about an hour and is
relieved by Fioricet, associated with photophobia, phonophobia but no nausea or vomiting. The
headaches have decreased in frequency to 2 times per week, since starting the Topiramate.





Social History: Senior controller for Philadelphia gas works. Monitors gas pressure for the city of
Philadelphia. Denies smoking, recreational drug use, and alcohol.



Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Characterization of seizures.


Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:


- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam

There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service




CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:






A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate

characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.

INDUCTION PROCEDURES:

1. None



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:


Events: The patient had 3 clinical events of shaking /trembling with no loss of conscience while
hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy monitoring unit with no EEG
correlate.
No typical events.




Interictal Findings:


None


Ictal Findings:


None


SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:


1. None captured.




EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Psychogenic or non epileptic events vs  Possible Epilepsy



CONCLUSION:


was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 6 days with continuous video EEG.  The
patient was weaned off Topiramate and xanax over the course of his admission. He was restarted on
her medication on the day prior to his discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes
were made during the hospitalization.




The patient had a discussion about the possibility of nonepileptic and particularly
psychogenic events and their association with underlying psychiatric co-morbidities and are not due
to abnormal electrical discharges of the brain/cortex.



Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
