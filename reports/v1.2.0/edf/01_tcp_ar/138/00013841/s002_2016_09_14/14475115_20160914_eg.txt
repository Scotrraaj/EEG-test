HISTORY: 40 y.o. male s/p gunshot wound to right side of head s/p craniotomy referred for long term monitoring post-op for screening for subclinical seizures and assessment of mental status change. This study follows a portable routine EEG.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: Propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion tetanus, diphth, pertus(acell) (BOOSTRIX) injection 0.5 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % with KCl 20 mEq/L infusion pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg labetalol (NORMODYNE,TRANDATE) injection 20 mg hydralazine (APRESOLINE) injection 10 mg docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL multivitamin liquid 5 mL oxycodone (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 5 mg morphine injection 2 mg [START ON 9/17/2016] enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg cefepime (MAXIPIME) 2 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+ phenylephrine (NEO-SYNEPHRINE) 80 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL infusion gentamicin PF 8 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB   SEDATION: Propofol  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (9/14/2016, 18:35 - 9/15/2016, 11:02)  BACKGROUND: The background is continuous but asymmetric.  The left hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of theta, alpha, and beta. The right hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of theta, alpha, delta, and beta. In addition there is attenuation of faster frequencies over the right temporal region (F8/T4/T6). There is an amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitudes over the right parasagittal region, which may represent breach rhythm.  There background is otherwise featureless, without a posterior dominant rhythm or sleep transients.  Drowsiness and sleep is associated with attenuation of theta and alpha, with increased prevalence of delta and beta. The hemispheric asymmetry persists.  There is moderate generalized slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  See "events"  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None definite  EVENTS:  Runs of delta activity that increase in amplitude, change in morphology, and phase reverse over the right frontal region (F4) without spread are seen beginning 20:26. These last from 2 min up to 10 min, often with gradual onset/offset. There is no definite evolution or clinical correlation. Technician checks F4 and reports it is near a wet bandage. Significance of these runs is unclear but based on morphology and confinement of discharges to F4 without spread, they are most likely lead artifact.  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 60s-70s  *The primary team reported the patient was following commands on the right side and disconnected the EEG on 9/15/2016 11:02.   FINAL IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate generalized slowing with background disorganization 2. Continuous right hemisphere slowing 3. Attenuation over the right temporal region 4. Likely breach rhythm over the right parasagittal region   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings indicate the presence of right hemispheric dysfunction (likely structural in etiology) with right temporal cortical dysfunction (likely structural in etiology), superimposed on a moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.   Breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known history of craniotomy.  Runs of delta at F4 as above are ultimately of unclear significance, most are most likely lead artifact.
