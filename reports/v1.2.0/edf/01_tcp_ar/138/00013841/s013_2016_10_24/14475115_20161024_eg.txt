SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by continuous
diffuse low voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.






The right hemisphere reveals almost complete attenuation of any electrical activity.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Continuous right hemisphere almost complete attenuation of electrical activity

2. Moderate to severe diffuse generalized slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal coma routine EEG due to continuous right hemisphere almost complete
attenuation of electrical activity, which is indicative of severe cortical structural dysfunction in that
region. In addition there is moderate to severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
