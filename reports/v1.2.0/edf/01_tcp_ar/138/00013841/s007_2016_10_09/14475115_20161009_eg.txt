 HISTORY: 40 y.o. male with a history of GSW to head, R craniotomy, L ACA infarct, aneurysm, Episodes of desaturations accompanied by eyelid fluttering. Resolved without intervention once, second episode resolved with Ativan. referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: desmopressin (DDAVP) injection 2 mcg valproate (DEPACON) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 2.5 mg fentaNYL (SUBLIMAZE) 1 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion gentamicin PF 8 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL phenylephrine (NEO-SYNEPHRINE) 80 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL infusion mannitol (OSMITROL) 20 % infusion 50 g famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg ARIPiprazole (ABILIFY) tablet 5 mg sodium ferric gluconate (FERRLECIT) 125 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB epoetin alfa (EPOGEN,PROCRIT) injection 40,000 Units ferrous sulfate 300 mg (60 mg iron)/5 mL syrup 300mg morphine injection 2 mg  SEDATION: propofol, see above  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (10/9/2016, 09:00)  BACKGROUND: The background is markedly abnormal. The activity on the right is continuously suppressed.  The left demonstrates a low voltage, discontinuous pattern with low voltage bursts mixed frequency activity, rarely with isolated fast activity There were persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Stimulation by nursing seemed to augment theta activity on some occasions.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: None  EKG: A single lead captured HR 93 BPM  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: 1. Suppressed pattern on the right 2. Paucity of activity on the left. The eye blink events were not tagged and if they occurred, did not have an EEG signature   DAY 2 (10/10/2016- 10/11/2016, 17:00)  BACKGROUND: The background is markedly abnormal. The activity on the right is continuously suppressed.  The left demonstrates a low voltage, discontinuous pattern with low voltage bursts mixed frequency activity, rarely with isolated fast reactivity. Later sections of the record on the 11th are  There were persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. Stimulation by nursing seemed to augment theta activity on some occasions.  This is less prominent on the 11th EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None EVENTS: Asymmetric Eye blink is noted, and is not associated with an ictal pattern. At times, continuous eye blink was seen.   EKG: A single lead captured HR 90 BPM  DAY 2 OVERALL IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Suppressed pattern on the right 2. Paucity of activity on the left. More Notable on the 11th.  3.  There is some reactivity noted only on the left, seen more consistently on the first day of the recording.  The eye blink events occurred, did not have an EEG signature.
