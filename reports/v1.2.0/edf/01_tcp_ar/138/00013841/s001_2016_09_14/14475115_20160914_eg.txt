SEDATION: propofol



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is continuous but asymmetric.

The left hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of theta, alpha, and beta.


The right hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of theta, alpha, delta, and beta. In addition
there is attenuation of faster frequencies over the right temporal region (F8/T4/T6). There is an
amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitudes over the right parasagittal region, which may represent
breach rhythm.




There background is otherwise featureless, without a posterior dominant rhythm or sleep transients.



Drowsiness and sleep is associated with attenuation of theta and alpha, with increased prevalence of
delta and beta. The hemispheric asymmetry persists.



There is moderate generalized slowing.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal coma study stat portable EEG due to:


1. Moderate generalized slowing with background disorganization

2. Continuous right hemisphere slowing

3. Attenuation over the right temporal region

4. Likely breach rhythm over the right parasagittal region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of right hemispheric dysfunction (likely structural in etiology)
with right temporal cortical dysfunction (likely structural in etiology), superimposed on a moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.



Breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known history of craniotomy.



Following this study the patient was continued on long term monitoring.
