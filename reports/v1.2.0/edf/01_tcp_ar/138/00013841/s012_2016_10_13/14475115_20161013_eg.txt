HISTORY: 40 y.o. male with a history of GSW to head, R crani, L ACA infarct referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures. Convulsive activity last night.   MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 500 mL IVPB LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 1 mg modafinil (PROVIGIL) tablet 100 mg amantadine HCl (SYMMETREL) capsule 100 mg white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg insulin regular (HumuLIN R,NovoLIN R) injection 1-5 Units valproate (DEPACON) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB midazolam (VERSED) 50 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL infusion heparin 25,000 units (100 units/mL) in 0.45% sodium chloride 250 mL infusion (Premix) ceFEPIme (MAXIPIME) 2 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB desmopressin (DDAVP) injection 2 mcg albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 2.5 mg fentaNYL (SUBLIMAZE) 1 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion gentamicin PF 8 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL phenylephrine (NEO-SYNEPHRINE) 80 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL infusion mannitol (OSMITROL) 20 % infusion 50 g famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg ARIPiprazole (ABILIFY) tablet 5 mg morphine injection 2 mg   TECHNIQUE: A portable 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)  Monitor was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.  DAY 1 (10/13/2016- 10/14/2016) BACKGROUND: The waking background is asymmetric, essentially suppressed on the right with paucity of activity on the left. The EEG is more continuous when he has eye blink.  Posterior dominant rhythm was not present. The background is slightly variable. It more continuous than the prior days. There is scant cerebral activity discernable on the right.  There were persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Low voltage brief fast, T5 not sustained EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare L temporal sharps, less than 1 per hour EVENTS:  The Team pressed the button for several events, which appear to be: 1. Eye blink 2. R hand tremor 3. Generalized stiffening with bathing or other movement  Times 11:07 - stiffening 12:38- eye blink 3:36 PM - family at bedside, eye blink 6:15 PM Stiffening  There is no EEG change for these behaviors.  EKG: A single lead captured HR 90 BPM  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: Markedly abnormal background with suppressed EEG on the right. Rare simple left temporal sharp waves Stiffening and eye blink without EEG change. Overall the background is improving.  There were no electrographic seizures.
