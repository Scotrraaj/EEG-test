HISTORY:

69 y.o. man p/w  aortic dissection s/p surgery. Pt is now having right
shoulder/arm/face twitching. EEG to rule out seizures



MEDICATIONS:


Keppra

Ativan



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:





No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Quasi-periodic irregular bifrontal spikes with associated muscle twitching artifact seen best over the
right.  Patient noted to have right shoulder twitching.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

See above.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Bifrontal spikes with associated muscle twitching.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal routine EEG due to focal motor seizures, which is suggestive of a bifrontal
structural cortical irritable lesion. There is in additional diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction. Will go to LTM.
