HISTORY: 69 y.o. man p/w aortic dissection s/p surgery. Pt is now having right shoulder/arm/face twitching. EEG to rule out seizures  MEDICATIONS: Keppra Ativan  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  DAY 1 (07/09/16, 2PM - 07/10/2016, 11:00AM)  EEG BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Sleep is not captured  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Quasi-periodic irregular bifrontal spikes with associated muscle twitching artifact seen best over the right.  Patient noted to have right shoulder twitching. These discharges progressively slow down in frequency and by the last 5 hours are not seen.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: See above.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: 1. Bifrontal spikes with associated muscle twitching. 2. Improving background slow waves  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to focal motor seizures which stop, which is suggestive of a bifrontal structural cortical irritable lesion. There is in additional diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
