HISTORY:

18 y.o. female with a history of new types of

events concerning for seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9-9.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not


performed.



EVENTS:

An event is reported by the EEG technologist at the onset of the

recording.  No video is available for review.  Electrographically

there is no change in the background.  Rapid eye blinking


artifact is noted.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  A single event

has no abnormal ictal correlate (it is not captured on a video).



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.

A single event has no abnormal ictal correlate (it is not


captured on a video)
