No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and  Verbal stimulation.  This is a bedside emergency room
record.  The technologist had some difficulties with electrode impedance




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and theta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7-10 posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  The waking
background is variable.  Some sections demonstrate more of a 5-7 Hz theta pattern and others have a
bit more alpha frequency activity




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained



Modest generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response.  This is more
vigorous at the end of the EEG


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 68 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. modest, bilateral generalized slowing, more prominent in the early section of the record



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific.  The generalized background slowing can be seen in the context of
bilateral cerebrovascular disease or an underlying dementia.  The EEG is not quite as slow at the
end of the record.  Perhaps the fall today played a role.  Metabolic features can also create this
pattern.




Attending Epileptologist:


I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
