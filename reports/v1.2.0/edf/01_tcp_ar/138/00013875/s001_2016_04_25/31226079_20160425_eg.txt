RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: 

EEG TYPE: Long term recording





HISTORY:

a 35 y.o. male admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring
with a history of: refractory epilepsy.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is
not a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9, T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

LTG 100-100 (100 mg 1 tab BID)


Onfi 10mg 1 tab daily

Banzel 1200-1200 (400 mg 3 tabs BID [2400mg per day])

Depakote 750-750 (250 mg 3 tabs BID)



Risperdal 6 mg per day

Fluoxetine 20mg qd



SEDATION: None


DAY 1 (4/25/2016, 17:51 - 4/26/2016, 06:00)





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous, symmetric, and reactive. There is fair organization with
fragments of an irregular posterior dominant rhythm approaching 7-8 Hz, with excess quasi-rhythmic
sharply contoured delta activity frontally.



Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant
rhythm, and further slowing of the background.  Rudimentary sleep spindles are seen synchronously
and symmetrically.




Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Frequent right anterior temporal (F8/T2) sharp waves, activated by sleep


2. Occasional sharply contoured rhythmic delta waves phase reverse over left temporal region (T3),
not clearly epileptiform


3. Frequent bursts of diffuse frontally predominant spike and wave and polyspike and wave, for up to
600 msec, activated by sleep.

4. Frequent right frontal spikes, activated by sleep


5. Frequent bursts of generalized paroxysmal fast activity in sleep, lasting 1-6 seconds. Some are
associated with arousal from sleep (see below under "events") and can thus be classified as seizures



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: not performed


EVENTS:


Note that events were classified by behavioral manifestations.


Type #1 - staring event


4/25/2016 at 19:20

Push button for staring

Clinical: Behavioral arrest, staring, nonverbal. Duration ~54 sec.


EEG: no change in background activity


Type #2 - tonic/hypermotor seizure




4/25/2016 at 22:40

Clinical: out of sleep, patient sits up, opens eyes, rocks back and forth, then arches back, sits up
again, then flips over on his back. He is agitated. Within seconds he calms down and attends to EMU
tech.



EEG: burst of frontally predominant diffuse spike and wave and polyspike and wave followed by a
slow wave, then attenuation. Background then obscured by diffuse muscle activity lasting 27 seconds.
Duration 27 sec. Postictally, background is attenuated for about 330 seconds.



Type #3 - arousal from sleep


Examples include 4/26/2016 at 01:37, 01:40, 01:49

Clinical: arousal from sleep (eyes open)

EEG: burst of generalized paroxsymal fast activity for 3-7 seconds



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal video EEG due to:


1. Mild to moderate diffuse slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Frequent right anterior temporal (F8/T2) sharp waves, activated by sleep

3. Occasional sharply contoured rhythmic delta waves phase reverse over left temporal region (T3),
not clearly epileptiform


4. Frequent bursts of diffuse frontally predominant spike and wave and polyspike and wave, for up to
600 msec, activated by sleep.


5. Frequent right frontal spikes, activated by sleep

6. Frequent bursts of generalized paroxysmal fast activity in sleep, lasting 1-6 seconds. Some are
associated with arousal from sleep (see below under "events") and can thus be classified as seizures


7. Episodes of staring without EEG change in background activity

8. Seizures (hypermotor, tonic) associated with pattern of frontally predominant spike and polyspike
and slow wave followed by electrodecrement


9. Seizures (arousals from sleep) associated with pattern of generalized paroxysmal fast activity





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are diagnostic for symptomatic generalized epilepsy with multiple seizure types.
There is evidence for multifocal epileptogenic potentials, as well as mild to moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:


INTERICTAL FINDINGS:



The patients interictal findings are significant for mild to moderate generalized slowing, with fair
organization and fragments of an irregular posterior dominant rhythm approaching 7-8 Hz, with
excess quasi-rhythmic sharply contoured delta activity frontally. In sleep, rudimentary sleep spindles
are seen synchronously and symmetrically.




Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.



There is multifocal epileptogenic activity as such:

1. Frequent right anterior temporal (F8/T2) sharp waves, activated by sleep

2. Occasional sharply contoured rhythmic delta waves phase reverse over left temporal region (T3),
not clearly epileptiform


3. Frequent bursts of diffuse frontally predominant spike and wave and polyspike and wave, for up to
600 msec, activated by sleep.


4. Frequent right frontal spikes, activated by sleep

5. Frequent bursts of generalized paroxysmal fast activity in sleep, lasting 1-6 seconds. Some are
associated with arousal from sleep (see below under "events") and can thus be classified as seizures





ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient had multiple clinical events:



He had staring spells/behavioral arrests.  Many of these (event Type #1) had no clear EEG and/or
EKG changes and most likely represent behavioral stares. However, others (event Type #4) were
associated with either attenuation of his background activity and/or significant tachycardia.  These
latter staring episodes may represent seizures.




The patient also had tonic/hypermotor seizures (event Type #2) which were variably associated with
a burst of frontally predominant diffuse spike and wave and polyspike and wave followed by a slow
wave, then attenuation, or by generalized paroxysmal fast activity followed by slow wave,
electrodecrement, or simply by background attenuation.








Lastly, he had frequent bursts of generalized paroxysmal fast activity in sleep, which was at times
associated with a clinical change in his behavior (arousal from sleep, event Type #3).



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:


1. Mixed: atypical absence, tonic/hypermotor


EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:


1. Symptomatic generalized epilepsy in setting of possible TSC


CONCLUSION:


 was admitted to the for 4 days with continuous video EEG.
This was an elective monitoring session for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



The patient was weaned off Zonegran over the course of his admission. His Banzel was increased
from 1200 mg q12h to 1600 mg q12h.  No other medication changes were made during the
hospitalization.


His findings are diagnostic for multifocal epileptogenic potentials and symptomatic generalized
epilepsy in setting of possible TSC.



Patient will follow-up with  as an outpatient.
