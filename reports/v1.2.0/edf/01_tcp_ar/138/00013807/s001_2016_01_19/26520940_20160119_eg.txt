HISTORY:

41 y.o. male with a history of endocarditis

and mitral valve regurgitation s/p cardiac surgery on 1/7, who


coded in the operating room, referred for routine EEG for

assessment of mental status change.




MEDICATIONS: norepinephrine, vasoc



SEDATION: None listed




TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.







EEG BACKGROUND:

The background consists of a symmetric mix of disorganized delta


activity with suppressed faster frequencies. There is no

reactivity to noxious stimulation, variability, or state change.


Spontaneous eye blink artifact and lateral eye movement artifact

are seen.



Severe generalized slowing is present.


There is no focal slowing.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:


1. Severe generalized slowing and disorganization, with lack of

background reactivity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of severe cerebral

dysfunction.
