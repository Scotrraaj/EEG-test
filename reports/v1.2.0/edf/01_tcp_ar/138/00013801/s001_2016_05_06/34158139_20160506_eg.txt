HISTORY:


Female Trb7138 is a 115 y.o. WOMAN FOUND DOWN. INTRACRANIAL BLEED,SUBARACHNOID.
PT WAS IN A MVA ON SUNDAY EVENING WITH HUSBAND AND 2 CHILDREN.



MEDICATIONS:

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse very low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.





The right hemisphere appears slightly more suppressed than the left.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of  96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Right hemisphere attenuation

2. Severe diffuse background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal portable EEG due to right hemisphere attenuation, which is indicative of cortical
dysfunction in that region. In addition there is severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
