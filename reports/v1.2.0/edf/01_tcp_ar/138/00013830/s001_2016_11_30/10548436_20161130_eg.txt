HISTORY:

69 y.o. male with a history of heart failure, alcohol abuse, heroin abuse on
methadone, is now agitated.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

SEDATION: propofol



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.



The background consists of periods of slow low amplitude polymorphic delta activity admixed with
brief periods of polymorphic theta activity.  Broadly based triphasic waves appear with stimulation.



No normal sleep architecture is captured.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~113 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate to severe diffuse slowing

2. Triphasic waveforms



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific but suggestive of toxic-metabolic etiologies.



Triphasic waves are a nonspecific EEG finding that can be seen in encephalopathy (mostly
commonly hepatic), uremia, anoxia and many other etiologies.
