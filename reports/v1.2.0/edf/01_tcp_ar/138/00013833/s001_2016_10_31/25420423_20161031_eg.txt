SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG..




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a mixture of low amplitude alpha and
beta frequencies, with a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at best reaches 8 Hertz . The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.


Excess 5-7 Hz activity is seen in wakefulness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.






Sleep is characterized by sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep
spindles. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Mild generalized slow waves.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
