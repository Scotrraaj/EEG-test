HISTORY:

50 YR OLD MAN R HANDED. PT HAS A TREMOR AND MRI SHOWS PREVIOUS
STROKE IN CEREBALLER PT ALSO SAYS HE WAS HIT WITH A BSEBALL BAT YRS AGO.
PMHX.HIV. ANIXETY,STROKE  BP 130/68




MEDICATIONS:

METFORMIN,VALIUM AT NIGHT



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically poor record due
to muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:








The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Intermittent PVCs are seen.



IMPRESSION:

This is a limited normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a limited normal awake only routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
