HISTORY:

50 y.o. male with a history of HIV, TBI, recurrent tremor referred for routine EEG for
encephalopathy, encephalitis.



MEDICATIONS:

Zosyn, Vanco, Valium, HIV therapy




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically unsatisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG*and photic excess muscle and noise.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  There was tremor, lots of
noise and movement artifact.

Head rocking artifact was seen.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal  routine EEG. However, it lacks 20 minutes of good quality recording and there is no
sleep.  There are no specific hallmarks of an infectious encephalitis or encephalopathy.  A repeat
EEG in the lab should be considered for a more complete evaluation.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
