SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

verbal  stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a  low

voltage but well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta


frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5Hertz posterior

dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient


of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep includes vertex waves K complexes and spindles.  The

rhythmic right anterior temporal slowing is present in stage II


sleep.  See below



No generalized slowing is present.

Focal slowing is present: Rhythmic right temporal focal slowing

is noted particularly right anterior temporal region.  This is

most prominent in drowsiness.  There are also a handful of bursa


shifting slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  portable record N./A.

EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 50 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. rhythmic right temporal focal slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings support structural or functional process on the


right, congruent with history described above.  While there are

no definitive epileptiform discharges, the type of rhythmic


slowing seen is common in temporal lobe epilepsy
