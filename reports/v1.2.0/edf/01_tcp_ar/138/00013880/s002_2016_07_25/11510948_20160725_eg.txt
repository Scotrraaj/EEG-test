HISTORY:

58 YR MALE WHO CODED 7/22 AM 8:33 AM X 12 MINUTES AND 9:15 AM X5
MINUTES. NEURO EVALUATION.  PT TEMP IS 93.3'  PRIOR TO CODES STROKE ALERT CALLED
. PT WITH UNEQUAL PUPILS AND CHANGE IN MS  FOLLOW UP EEG..  TEMP 94'




MEDICATIONS:

NOREPINEPHRINE, PANTOPRAZOLE, PIPERACILLIN



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized mixture of central
alpha and diffuse theta frequencies, with an intermittent posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) which at
best reaches 7 Hz. At times an anterior-to-posterior gradient albeit slow but present.




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

Some muscle reactivity is noted with ocular stimulation.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to mild to moderate generalized slowing
and disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.




No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
