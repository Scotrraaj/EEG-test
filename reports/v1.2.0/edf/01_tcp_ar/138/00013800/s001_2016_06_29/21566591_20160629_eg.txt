DATE OF STUDY: 06/29/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy sleep


HISTORY:

a 53 y.o. female with a history of relatively large right middle cerebral artery stroke
one month ago referred for routine EEG for left-sided weakness.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.

cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12) 100 mcg Tablet, Take 1,000 mcg by mouth daily.


ergocalciferol, Vitamin D2, (VITAMIN D) 50,000 unit Capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth every 7
days.
Ibuprofen (ADVIL LIQUI-GEL) 200 mg Capsule, Take 400 mg by mouth 3 times daily as needed.

Lipitor


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by vertex waves K complexes spindles and posts.  Of note, in stage II sleep,
there are some asynchronous bursts of slowing noted in the their hemisphere, only in stage II sleep



No generalized slowing is present.


Only in stage II sleep focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of  60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1.  Irregular slowing noted in stage II sleep from either hemisphere, infrequent





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


No epileptiform features were identified.  Given the magnitude of the recent stroke, this shifting
slowing noted in stage II sleep was quite sparse.



Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
