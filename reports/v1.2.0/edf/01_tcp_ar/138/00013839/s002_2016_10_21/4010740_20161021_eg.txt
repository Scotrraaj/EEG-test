SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The posterior rhythm over the right reaches 8.5 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity and attenuates
with eye opening.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left is fragmented and reaches 7.5 Hz
attenuated theta activity.  The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present.




Diffuse excess beta activity is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous vertex waves, sleep spindles and
K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54-60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Focal slowing and attenuation of voltages over the left posterior quadrant.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings suggest a focal structural lesion over the left posterior quadrant.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.




The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
