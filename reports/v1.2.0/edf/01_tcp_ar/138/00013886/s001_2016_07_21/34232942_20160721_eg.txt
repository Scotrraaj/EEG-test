HISTORY:

38 y.o. female with a history of cerebral palsy, epilepsy. Seizure free 18 years,
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

PHENOBARBITAL PO, Take  by mouth 2 times daily.

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 250 mg tablet, Take 250 mg by mouth 2 times daily. Also 500 mg


diazepam (VALIUM) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily.

Melatonin 5 mg Tablet, Take  by mouth nightly.

cetirizine (ZYRTEC) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.


CALCIUM CARBONATE/VITAMIN D3 (VITAMIN D-3 PO), Take  by mouth.

SENNOSIDES (SENNA LAX PO), Take  by mouth 2 times daily




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


A 1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International
10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically
satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation. Patient was
recorded on a stretcher.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7.5-8.5 Hertz 40 uV posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, and an increase in beta are  seen.



Sleep is not captured

Scant  generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm and variability of the alpha rhythm




CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings  are non-specific and may be part of this part of this patient's chronic cerebral
pathology. There were no spike seen,
