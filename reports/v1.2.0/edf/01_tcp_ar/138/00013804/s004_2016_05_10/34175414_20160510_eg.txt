HISTORY:


60 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy, s/p cardiac arrest on May 9 referred
for EEG for hypothermia protocol.  Presented with Fixed and dilated pupils, initial CT brain
demonstrated  diffuse loss of the gray-white junction with complete effacement of the subarachnoid
spaces including the sulci and basal cisterns, transtentorial herniation.




MEDICATIONS:

Lamictal



SEDATION: Fentanyl


TECHNIQUE:


Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)
was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne
system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile
stimulation.  Initial recording temperature: 32 degreees.  Patient was gradually re-warmed 2 hours
after the study started.








DAY 1 (05/10/2016,  14:00- 5/11/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND:

The  background is markedly suppressed.  There is little, if any EEG activity, other than EKG artifact.

The background is NOT reactive, NOT variable.




PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single lead captured HR 60-132


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Essentially suppressed cerebral activity.  However, this pattern must be evaluated in the context of
the current body temperature and medicine use on the morning of May 11, 2016.




DAY 2 (05/11/2016,  6:00- 5/12/2016, xx:00)



BACKGROUND:

Initally, the  background is markedly suppressed.  There is little, if any EEG activity, other than EKG
artifact.


The background is NOT reactive, NOT variable.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM)/ EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


From 7:50 AM until nearly 1 PM there is scant cerebral activity characterized low-voltage, subtle
GPEDS, or low-voltage, frontally predominant bifid sharp waves occurring no more often than every 3
seconds, not involving.






EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single lead captured HR 60-132



DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Initially suppressed cerebral activity.  This was followed by a brief period with cerebral activity which
then disappeared.  The patient had been rewarmed during this section of the record.  At the close of
this section of the record, the EEG was low-voltage, featureless and not reactive.




-----------------------------------------------------------------



FINAL IMPRESSION:


This is abnormal video EEG due to:



1. absence of cerebral activity




FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings were present and sustained after the patient was rewarmed.  The patient went on to a
formal brain death evaluation which included a formal ECS EEG as well
