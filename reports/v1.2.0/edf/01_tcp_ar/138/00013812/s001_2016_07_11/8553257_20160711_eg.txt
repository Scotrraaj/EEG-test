HISTORY:

70 y.o. with a hx of 2 seizure in the past 6 months. No prior history of seizures.
P/w seizure.


no hx of stroke

No other history in chart



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized mixture of theta and
alpha frequencies, with a reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that is best seen on the left at 8
Hertz .




Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the fronto
temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere maximal in the fronto temporal region.

2. Mild diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere
maximal in the fronto temporal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction
in this region, likely structural in origin. In addition there is mild diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.



No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
