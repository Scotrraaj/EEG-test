HISTORY:

58 y.o. male with a history of ESRD, now with sepsis and possible stroke, referred
for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

ARIPiprazole (ABILIFY) tablet 2 mg

magnesium oxide (MAG-OX) tablet 800 mg


amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg

potassium chloride tablet 40 mEq

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a slightly disorganized symmetric mixture
of theta, alpha, and beta frequencies, with an asymmetric but reactive 7-9 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. The
alpha is slower on the left.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Subtle focal slowing is present on the left and includes a bit more theta on the left and a slower PDR.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild background slowing

2. Subtle asymmetry with a slower pattern on the left



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings may be attributed in part to the sepsis. Correlation with imaging in regards to the
subtle focal features is recommended.
