DATE OF STUDY: 09/14/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 67 y.o. male with a history of CVA, ESRD, esophageal strictures s/p PEG,
seizures vs myoclonus on Keppra 500 q12h referred for routine EEG after he developed right arm/leg
jerking, right gaze/head deviation. Patient now s/p treatment with benzodiazpines and being treated
with boluses of Keppra and Depakote.




MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

valproate (DEPACON) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

aspirin EC tablet 81 mg


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg

sertraline (ZOLOFT) tablet 25 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric.

The right hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of alpha, theta, and delta.

The left hemisphere consists of delta activity with attenuated fast frequencies.


There is no posterior dominant rhythm.


Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by attenuation of faster frequencies as seen on the right
hemisphere with increased prevalence of theta and delta. There are no well-formed sleep transients.




There is moderate generalized slowing is present.

There is continuous left hemispheric focal slowing with attenuated fast frequencies.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate generalized slowing with background disorganization

2. Continuous left hemispheric focal slowing with attenuated fast frequencies




CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a left hemispheric cortical dysfunction that could be seen in
the setting of a structural injury or postictal state, superimposed on a moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction. Following this study the patient remained connected for longer monitoring.
