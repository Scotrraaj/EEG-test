HISTORY: 67 y.o. male with a history of twitching and altered mental status referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events and assessment of mental status change.  MEDICATIONS: Versed Vecuronium Keppra  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  DAY 1 (7/27/2016, 07:38 - 7/28/2016 06:00)  EEG BACKGROUND: The background is continuous, symmetric, but poorly organized and consists of mostly disorganized theta, alpha, and beta. There is no posterior dominant rhythm. There is no reactivity or state change. There is variability, with some periods of occasional 1-2 second attenuation.  There is severe generalized slowing. There is no persistent focal slowing or focal attenuation.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) right occipital sharp waves (O2>O1/T6 max). These decrease to rare (<1/hr) over the course of the day.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: CLINICAL: The examining team notes low amplitude jaw twitching (opening-closing) ~7/27 10:40 am. EEG: The entire record is reviewed. There is no ictal EEG correlate during this time.  HEART RATE: A heart rate in the 70s is captured on a single EKG lead.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing and disorganization, lack of reactivity 2. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) right occipital sharp waves (O2>O1/T6 max), decreasing to rare over the course of the recording. 3. Episode of jaw twitching without EEG correlate.  DAY 1 CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of right occipital epileptogenic potential superimposed on severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Episode of jaw twitching had no EEG correlate; however, a surface negative seizure cannot be excluded. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (7/28/2016, 06:00 - 7/28/2016, 10:45)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Rare right occipital sharp waves (O2>O1/T6 max)  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change in background. Occipital sharp waves remain rare.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Severe generalized slowing and disorganization, lack of reactivity 2. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) right occipital sharp waves (O2>O1/T6 max), decreasing to rare by the end of day 1 3. Episode of jaw twitching without EEG correlate on day 1.   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of right occipital epileptogenic potential superimposed on severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Episode of jaw twitching had no EEG correlate; however, a surface negative seizure cannot be excluded.
