HISTORY:

67 y.o. male with a history of twitching and altered mental status referred for
routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events and assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Versed

Vecuronium

Keppra




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is continuous, symmetric, but poorly organized and consists of mostly disorganized
theta, alpha, and beta.


There is no posterior dominant rhythm.


There is no reactivity, nor is there variability or state change.


There is severe generalized slowing.


There is no persistent focal slowing or focal attenuation.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) right occipital sharp waves (O2>O1/T6 max)


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:


1. Severe generalized slowing and disorganization, lack of reactivity

2. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) right occipital sharp waves (O2>O1/T6 max)



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of right occipital epileptogenic potential superimposed on
severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Following this study a more prolonged monitoring study was recommended.
