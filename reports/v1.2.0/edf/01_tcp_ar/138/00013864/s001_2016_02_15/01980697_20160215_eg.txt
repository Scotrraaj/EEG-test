HISTORY:

85 y.o. FEMALE WITH CC BEING LETHARGIC,

NOT FOLLOWING COMMANDS. PT APHASIC.


PMHX: ACUTE  RIGHT PCA, LEFT MCA.


MEDICATIONS:


LOVENOX, ATORVASTATIN, LISINOPRIL, METFORMIN, INSULIN, KEPPRA,

ASA




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence poorly

organized mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a 9 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). Mainly the background consist of

a mixture of theta and delta discharges, at times frontal

intermittent delta activity (FIRDA) is seen.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1. Mild to moderate diffuse slowing


2. FIRDA



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to mild to


moderate diffuse slowing and FIRDA. These findings are indicative

of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which are


non-specific with regards to etiology.
