HISTORY:

22 y.o. MAN WHO STATES HAD EPISODE OF LOC.  EVALUATION FOR SEIZURE.



MEDICATIONS:

Unknown




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:






The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right mid temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Right mid temporal (T4) spikes are seen intermittently. Some have a atypical field that is more
frontal and central.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Right mid temporal spikes


2. Right mid temporal focal slow


CLINICAL CORRELATION:




This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to right mid temporal spikes.  These findings
are suggestive of a epileptogenic focus in this region. In addition there intermittent focal slowing in
the right mid-temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
