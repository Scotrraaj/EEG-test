DATE OF STUDY: 01/09/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy



HISTORY: 
a 77 y.o. male with a history of  Tremor and syncope referred for routine
EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 12 Units

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

famotidine (PEPCID) tablet 20 mg


albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) inhaler 2 puff

allopurinol (ZYLOPRIM) tablet 300 mg

aspirin EC tablet 81 mg


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg

carvedilol (COREG) tablet 12.5 mg

clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg


fluticasone-salmeterol (ADVAIR) 250-50 mcg/dose diskus inhaler 1 puff

furosemide (LASIX) tablet 80 mg



hydroxychloroquine (PLAQUENIL) tablet 200 mg

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 3 Units


magnesium oxide (MAG-OX) tablet 400 mg

tiotropium (SPIRIVA) inhalation capsule 18 mcg


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Micro-sleeps are noted.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none

EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 75 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.
