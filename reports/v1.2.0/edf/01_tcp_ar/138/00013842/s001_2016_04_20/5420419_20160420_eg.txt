HISTORY:

61 y.o. female with a history of recurrent

meningioma and possible medication overdose.



MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA, DECADRON, GABAPENTIN, MIDAZOLAM PRN




SEDATION: versed PRN



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.



The background consists of bursts of monomorphic diffuse ~6 Hz


theta activity admixed with bursts of diffuse slow delta

activity.   While awake, there is significant movement and eye

blinking artifact.



Bilateral sleep spindles are captured.  They are more blunted

over the left.  Additionally, during sleep left anterior delta


activity becomes more pronounced.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Moderate diffuse slowing

2. Subtle focal left frontal focal slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral

dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.


Focal slowing over the left frontal region and less well formed

sleep architecture over the left suggest focal structural lesion


over the left frontal region.


The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not

rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
