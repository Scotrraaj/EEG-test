SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
frequent movement artifact and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was asymmetric, on the left is mainly
characterized by diffuse delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.



On the right hemisphere there is a high amplitude sharply countoured quasi-rhythmic theta maximal
at F7/T3 that appears to increase and decrease in frequency with no clear evolution and an
associated breach. No clear clinical correlate is associated with this pattern. This pattern despite the
breach is concerning for an ictal-interictal spectrum pattern over the right hemisphere and possible
non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE).




Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left and right mid-temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

See above.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):



None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical  events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Quasi-rhythmic theta over the right frontotemporal region concerning for NCSE

2. Continuous left mid-temporal and right mid-temporal focal slow waves

3. Moderate diffuse slow



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to rhythmic right frontal theta concerning possible
NCSE. In addition there is continuous focal slowing in the bilateral temporal regions.  This finding is
indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin. Lastly there is
moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.




This findings were communicated to the primary team and the patient will be placed on continuous
EEG monitoring.
