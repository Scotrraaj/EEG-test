HISTORY: a 61 y.o. female with a history of meningioma surgery, epilepsy, confusion, referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.  

MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN) 1 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+ desmopressin (DDAVP) injection 1 mcg levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 112 mcg hydrocortisone (CORTEF) tablet 5 mg hydrocortisone (CORTEF) tablet 10 mg levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 500 mg aspirin EC tablet 81 mg thiamine tablet 100 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg  

SEDATION: None  

TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation. Seizure and spike detection software was used   

DAY 1 (- 8/29/2016, 17:00- 08/30/2016)  

BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous but asymmetric, poorly organized, and consists predominantly of Rhythmic 6 Hz theta on the right, and ADA with intermittent superimposed delta on left  Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.  The background is reactive, variable.  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Sleep was characterized by an increase in delta, and later by beta spindles and K complexes. She has EOMS in sleep.   

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Left sided bursts of Sharply contoured activity- delta frequency  

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Sharply contoured slowing in context of breach  

EVENTS: No clinical events reported or detected 

EKG: A single lead captured HR 84 BPM irreg  

DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Markedly slow and asymmetric pattern Shifting irregular slowing  No seizures were recorded
