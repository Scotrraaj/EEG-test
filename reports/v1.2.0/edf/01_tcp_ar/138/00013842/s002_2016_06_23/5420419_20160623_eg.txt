SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal  Stimulation.  Frontal cranial resection or
craniotomy defects are noted




EEG BACKGROUND:







The background is characterized by a pattern of rhythmic theta.  This is higher amplitude on the right
compared to the left.  The EEG attenuates intermittently.  On some occasions the attenuation may
be more prominent in the right hemisphere for the last.  Tactile stimulation produces a more
continuous background






Marked generalized slowing is present.

Shifting  focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: see above


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1.  Markedly slow pattern with intermittent attenuation.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings support a significant, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  Toxic or
metabolic factors, or, the magnitude of this patient's brain resection can all contribute to this pattern.
No seizures were recorded.




Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
