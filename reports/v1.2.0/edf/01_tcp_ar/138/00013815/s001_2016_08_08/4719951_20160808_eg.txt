DATE OF STUDY: 08/08/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 59 y.o. Woman p/w new onset seizure. PMH: Upper resp infection, COPD,
Depression, CHF



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 1,000 mg

albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) inhaler 2 puff


allopurinol (ZYLOPRIM) tablet 300 mg

arformoterol (BROVANA) nebulizer solution 15 mcg

aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg


budesonide (PULMICORT) nebulizer solution 0.25 mg

ferrous sulfate tablet 325 mg

dextrose 50% injection 25 mL


dextrose 50% injection 50 mL

glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg



insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 20 Units

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units


ipratropium (ATROVENT) 0.02 % nebulizer solution 0.002 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg


sildenafil (REVATIO) tablet 20 mg

heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 250 mg

treprostinil sodium (REMODULIN) 10 mg in glycine diluent 100 mL infusion



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present at F7/T3 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1. intermittent left anterior temporal focal slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the  left
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
