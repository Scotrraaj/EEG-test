Current facility-administered medications for this visit.

As above



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with


T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a

technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of

EKG, verbal and tactile stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient is somnolent throughout the record.  Scant


wakefulness is characterized by the presence of a  symmetric and

reactive 11Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is

present.  The patient stays awake for less than 2 seconds



Most of   the record captures drowsiness, slow rolling eye


movements, attenuation and a slower medium amplitude theta and

delta pattern


Sleep is characterized by scant vertex waves and spindles



Generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Tactile and verbal stimulation produced brief alerting


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Hypersomnolence

2. background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings and be seen in toxic or metabolic encephalopathy,


with the use of sedatives or in postictal state.  If indicated a

repeat study when patient is more awake may be of value
