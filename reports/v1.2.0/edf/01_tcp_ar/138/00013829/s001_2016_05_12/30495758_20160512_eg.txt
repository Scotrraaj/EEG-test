DATE OF STUDY: 05/12/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 51 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy since infancy, not seizure-free.  Seizures not
otherwise described, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 12.5 mg tablet, Take 12.5 mg by mouth daily.

Hexavitamin Tablet, Take  by mouth.

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 100 mg by mouth 3 times daily.


naproxen (NAPROSYN) 250 mg tablet, Take 250 mg by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 650 mg CR tablet, Take 650 mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed.

thiamine 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth daily.


folic acid (FOLVITE) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth daily.

lorazepam (ATIVAN) 2 mg tablet, Take 2 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed.

KEPPRA, GABAPENTIN, DILANTIN, HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, AMLODIPINE



SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes.  Beta spindles were noted Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Produces an increase in amplitude of the background



Photic Stimulation: Listed symmetric bilateral driving



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 76, irreg  bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  If additional information is needed, please consider
repeat one hour study or sleep deprived study


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
