HISTORY:

25 y.o. female with a history of new onset seizure with prolonged postictal state,
shaking, headache, vomiting referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change and
characterization of seizures.  Patient had three days of worst headache of her life before the seizure.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


acyclovir (ZOVIRAX) 400 mg tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth three times a day for 10 days

PNV NO.115/IRON FUMARATE/FA (PRENATAL #115-IRON-FOLIC ACID PO), Take  by mouth.

PEG 3350-electrolytes (GOLYTELY) 236-22.74-6.74 -5.86 gram Recon Soln, Take 1 each by mouth
as needed.



AEDs: Ativan, Dilantin



TECHNIQUE:







A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and tactile and verbal stimulation.  The patient was
uncomfortable and vomited.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of delta
and theta frequencies, with occasional overlying beta activity. The PDR is absent.



Sleep is not captured.


Generalized diffuse slowing is present throughout the record, greatest in the frontal regions
bilaterally.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

FIRDA



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile and verbal stimulation do not produce any changes in the EEG
record.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake yet stuporous routine EEG due to:

1. Diffuse generalized slowing, greatest in the frontal regions

2. FIRDA



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate bilateral cerebral dysfunction and should be correlated clinically. FIRDA is a
non-specific finding which can be seen in toxic metabolic encephalopathy, frontal lobe pathology or
deep grey matter process. There were no focal or epileptiform features.
