HISTORY:

25 y.o. female with a history of HA, angiogram demonstrating vasoconstrictive
syndrome. Patient had 3 days of worst headache of her life and presented with seizure. This is a
follow up EEG.




MEDICATIONS:

Trileptal, others



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is abnormal. It is characterized by the presence of a symmetric mixture of
theta, smaller amounts of scant beta


and scant reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior
gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




The waking background is disrupted by rhythmic high amplitude delta. It generally starts ocipitally
and shifts frontally. The delta bursts are 2-3 hz max.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Moderate generalized slowing is present.

Some focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

FIRDA



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: scant driving is seen



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Generalized background slowing

2. Irregular FIRDA

3. Shifting slowing, more prominent in right hemisphere



CLINICAL CORRELATION:




This EEG is markedly improved compared to a previous post ictal study.

These findings are non specific, indicate the presence of an ongoing CNS process.
