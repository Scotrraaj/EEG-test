HISTORY:

53 y.o. FEMALE FOUND DOWN AT HOME,WHEN PT DID NOT SHOW UP FOR
WORK POLICE WERE CALLED AND PT WAS ADMITTED FOR A BLED CVA
HEMORRHAGIC.PMHX.NO H/O SZ.




MEDICATIONS:

LOVENOX, KEPPRA,FAMOTIDINE, LISINOPRIL



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




There is continuous polymorphic delta and attenuation activity is present in the left fronto temporal
region..




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

The patient had left eye twitching and left arm and leg movements with not EEG correlate.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1.  Continuous left fronto temporal focal slowing and attenuation

2.  Diffuse slow, moderate or severe.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal coma routine EEG due to continuous left fronto temporal focal slowing and
attenuation. This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely
structural in origin.



In addition there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
