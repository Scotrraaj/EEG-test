DATE OF STUDY: 09/08/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep



HISTORY:

 a 24 y.o. male with a history of HIV, pancreatic disease, acute seizure
referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


No current facility-administered medications for this encounter.

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

oxazepam (SERAX) 15 mg capsule, Take one tab by mouth twice daily for three days, thenTake one
tab by mouth daily for three days, thenStop taking the medication


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 325 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth every 4 hours as needed for

current facility-administered medications for this encounter- n/a



SEDATION: not provided




TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The record begins with sedated beta pattern. Briefly the patient arouses with 11 Hz PDR and then
drifts off to stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile stimulation produces brief alerting

EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

CONTINUOUS ELECTRODE ARTIFACT WAS SEEN AT T6

IMPRESSION:


This is a  LIMITED BUT normal STAT EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported
or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This EEG.does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.  The excess beta may reflect
medicines.  Please repeat the study when he can cooperate.
