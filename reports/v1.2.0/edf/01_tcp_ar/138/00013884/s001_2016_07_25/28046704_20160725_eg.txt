HISTORY:

71 YO FEMALE ADM WITH CVA  WITH RT SIDED WEAKNESS AND A
GENERALIZED SEIZURE.



MEDICATIONS:


ZETIA, APRAZOLAM, MECLIZINE, FLORICET,METOPROL, NITROSTAT, LEVETIRACERTAN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
with a frequent movement and right temporalis muscle artifact. It included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:







A posterior dominant rhythm that at best reached 7.5 Hz was present. Background activity was
characterized by diffuse theta and some frontal delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to
posterior gradient of frequencies.




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to moderate diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
