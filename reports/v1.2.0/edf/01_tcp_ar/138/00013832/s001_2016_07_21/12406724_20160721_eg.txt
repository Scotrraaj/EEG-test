HISTORY:

64 y.o. male with a history of first ever seizure referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures. He had a blank look, then biting down, foaming at mouth, arms flexed.



MEDICATIONS:


Keppra




SEDATION: None reported


TECHNIQUE:


A bedside  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.  This is
likely a post ictal record for an adult who was initially very drowsy.




EEG BACKGROUND:



The waking background is characterized by the presence of a  Low voltage well organized symmetric
mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz 20 uV posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. POSTS are present. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

none



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile stimuli produces an alerting.

EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Patient initially very drowsy but normal wakefulness was captured.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings may be correlated with clinical history. Low voltage pattern pattern and generous
beta are normal finding.
