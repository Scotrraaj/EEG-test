HISTORY:

29 y.o. female with a history of CABG on 9/23. Was found unresponsive 9/26. She
has a h/o previous infarct with residual right side hemiparesis involving the lower part of her right face
and her right arm, referred for routine EEG for possible seizure.




MEDICATIONS: Levemir, Lopressor, Lipitor, Insulin, Asa, Plavix, Heparin, Percocet



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric. There is a symmetric posterior
dominant rhythm of 5-6 Hz.




The right hemisphere consists of fairly orgnaized diffuse theta and delta.

Left hemisphere consists of fairly organized delta > theta activity, with attenuated faster frequencies.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Moderate generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Continuous left hemispheric slowing and attenuation of fast frequencies



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of left hemispheric cortical dysfunction, likely structural in
etiology, superimposed on a moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
