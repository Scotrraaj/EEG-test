HISTORY:

24 y.o. female with a history of seizures, anxiety bipolar disease and positive
family history of epilepsy, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

divalproex (DEPAKOTE DR) 250 mg tablet, Take 250 mg by mouth 3 times daily.

divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth daily.


mirtazapine (REMERON) 15 mg tablet, Take 15 mg by mouth nightly.

MEDROXYPROGESTERONE ACETATE (DEPO-PROVERA IM), Inject  into the muscle.

zonisamide (ZONEGRAN) 100 mg capsule, Take 100 mg at bedtime. After 2 weeks, increase to 200
mg at bedtime


TECHNIQUE:


A   1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.
Initially, the patient seemed quite jittery






EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Generous beta was noted During drowsiness, slow rolling
eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.





Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured. POSTs noted in stage I and
stage II sleep


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:      Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds
with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96  bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal 1 hour awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic
events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
