HISTORY:

47 y.o. female with a history of seizures

since 2005 (last episode: 2015, reports 2, with LOC and postictal


confusion) referred for routine EEG for characterization of

seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a




NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical


or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal record does not rule out a convulsive disorder. If

clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
