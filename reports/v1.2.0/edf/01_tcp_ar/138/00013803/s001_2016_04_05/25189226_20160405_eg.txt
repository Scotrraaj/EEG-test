HISTORY:

65 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O CONGESTIVE

HEART FAILURE, EEG TO R/O  NCS.



MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was

characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity


with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies.



Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology

are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms

demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.





Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Triphasic waves

2. Diffuse slow, moderate to severe



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to frequent


frontally-maximal triphasic waves and moderate to severe diffuse

background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe


diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but

suggestive of a metabolic origin.
