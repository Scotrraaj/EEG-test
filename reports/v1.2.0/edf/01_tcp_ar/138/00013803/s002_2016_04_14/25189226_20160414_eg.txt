SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable portable Digital Video 21 channel


electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International

10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system.


This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single

channel of EKG with tactile and auditory stimulation.  The


patient is intubated, has facial chewing movements, is somewhat

responsive to tactile stimuli



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is characterized in a relatively symmetric, low

voltage delta pattern with intermittent, brief bursts of more

rhythmic theta




Generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Tactile stimulation elicits a lower voltage pattern with lower


voltage beta



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of  66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  ICU EEG due to:

1. marked background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific and should be evaluated in the

context of this patient's neurologic, cardiac and other systemic


pathologies.  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral

function.  Toxic, metabolic or anoxic factors can all contribute


to this pattern.  There was reactivity and variability.  No

seizures were identified.
