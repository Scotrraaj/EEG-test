DATE OF STUDY: 06/30/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 28 y.o. female with a history of stress related seizures.  Now one month pregnant,
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz 40-50  posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Rare PSWY are noted




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. There is rhythmic central theta present.


Sleep is  Not sustained.

No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: was not performed



Photic Stimulation: elicits scant driving

EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  Slightly  irregular.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

Further evaluation of the single EKG lead may be of value.



Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
