HISTORY:

53 y.o. male with a history of isolated seizure and right temporal intracerebral
hemorrhage in December, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions: Carvedilol, telmisartan, chlorthalidone, amlodipine, Keppra 500 mg
twice a day



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 15-25 uV 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. The patient did not fall asleep during the study
and no significant periods of drowsiness were seen.




No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of  66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
