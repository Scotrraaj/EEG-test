DATE OF STUDY: 01/04/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy






HISTORY:

a 90 y.o. female with a history of intracranial hemorrhage and confusion.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


labetalol (NORMODYNE,TRANDATE) injection 20 mg

hydrALAZINE (APRESOLINE) injection 10 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion


carvedilol (COREG) tablet 6.25 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) suppository 650 mg


ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg

famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg

docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg


senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet




bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) EC tablet 10 mg

magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL


polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) packet 17 g

alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL


multivitamin (THERA-M) w/minerals tablet

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background consists of 9-10 Hz polymorphic alpha activity posteriorly and weak AP (anterior-to-
posterior) gradient.



There is excess beta activity and polymorphic theta activity.



Continuous polymorphic theta and occasional delta activity is seen over the right temporal region.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 80 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild diffuse slowing and disorganization


2. Continuous moderate right temporal focal slowing.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Diffuse slowing and disorganization are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.



Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in the right temporal region.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
