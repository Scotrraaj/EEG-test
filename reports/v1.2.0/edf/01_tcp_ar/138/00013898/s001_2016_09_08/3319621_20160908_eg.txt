TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  She had several spells of hand
shaking and one episode of whole body shaking.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5  Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured

No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:




There are  Multiple clinical- there was hand shaking or whole body shaking. Patient can terminate
shaking by holding on to the chair.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no electrographic findings during the events
recorded.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG. The events in question were captured.
