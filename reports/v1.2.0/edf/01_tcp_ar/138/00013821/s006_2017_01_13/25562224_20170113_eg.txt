HISTORY: This is a 41 y.o. Right -> left handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.     Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.  Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons: - The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate. - Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus; - The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;   - The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient’s exam There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service  CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.   Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24 hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.    The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.    MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) inhaler 2 puff ergocalciferol (DRISDOL) drops 2,000 Units 0.25 mL docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg polyvinyl alcohol (LIQUIFILM TEARS) 1.4 % ophthalmic solution 1 drop pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg naproxen (NAPROSYN) tablet 375 mg OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) tablet 1,200 mg polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) packet 17 g topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 100 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg prenatal vitamin w/iron tablet oxybutynin (DITROPAN) tablet 5 mg folic acid (FOLVITE) tablet 400 mcg ondansetron (ZOFRAN) tablet 4 mg pneumococcal 23-val ps vaccine (PNEUMOVAX) injection 0.5 mL   SEDATION: None  DAY 1 (1/11/2017, 12:49 - 1/12/2017, 06:00)  AEDs: OXC 1200 q12h TOP 100 q12h  BACKGROUND:  The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.   PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present   ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.   EVENTS:  1/11/17 @ 22:35 - head shaking Clinical: patient lying in bed awake, shift legs, turns head slightly side to side, reaches for event button with left hand at 22:35, pushes it. RN enters room. Patient states head was shaking. Patient able to answer all testing questions appropriately and follow all commands. She remembers the code word.  EEG: normal awake background during this time. EKG: no change from baseline.  1/11/17 @ 22:44 - head shaking Clinical: Patient lying in bed awake, begins nodding head up and down 2-3 times. Husband presses button. RN enters room. Patient able to answer all testing questions appropriately and follow all commands. She remembers the code word. After testing is complete patient makes slight adduction room of her left lower extremities and does slight movement with right arm, she is able to complete all testing. EEG: normal awake background during this time. EKG: no change from baseline.  1/12/17 @ 02:44 - head shaking, slow to answer Clinical: patient lying in bed awake, reaches for event button with left hand, pushes it, has jerk of her upper trunk.

Nonepileptic behavioral events  EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:  1. Nonepileptic behavioral events  CONCLUSION:  The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 6 days with continuous video EEG.  This was an elective EMU monitoring session for characterization of paroxysmal events.  The interictal EEG is normal.   The patient was weaned off oxcarbazepine over the course of her admission. She was continued on her topiramate, albeit a lesser dose than at home. The topiramate was continued upon her discharge from the hospital, with the goal of addressing migraine headaches. No other medication changes were made during the hospitalization.   We recommend that she see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying psychopathology and diagnosis.
