DATE OF STUDY: 08/30/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 70 y.o.MALE R  HANDED WITH TRAUMATIC SAH.



PMHX.TYPE 2 DM DYSPHAGIA,



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:

famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg


amantadine HCl (SYMMETREL) solution 100 mg

sodium chloride tablet 1 g

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 2-10 Units


sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

polyvinyl alcohol (LIQUIFILM TEARS) 1.4 % ophthalmic solution 1 drop

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 30 mg


dextrose 50% injection 25 mL




dextrose 50% injection 50 mL

glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg





SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record
due to difficulties placing O2 electrode. It had to be placed close to T6 and included a single
channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive low voltage 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
