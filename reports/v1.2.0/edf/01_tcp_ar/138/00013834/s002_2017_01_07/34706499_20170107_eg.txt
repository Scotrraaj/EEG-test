RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU

EEG TYPE: long term monitoring



HISTORY:


a 32 y.o. male with a history of chronic static encephalopathy and epilepsy,
presenting with epilepsy exacerbation, referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:

lacosamide (VIMPAT) tablet 100 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg


LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

fludrocortisone (FLORINEF) tablet 100 mcg

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) solution 1,500 mg


levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 25 mcg





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with
T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and
included a single channel of EKG.




DAY 1 (1/7/2017, 11:48 - 1/8/2017, 07:10)



BACKGROUND:

The background is continuous and symmetric but consists of disorganized alpha, delta, and beta.
The background is otherwise featureless. There is no clear reactivity, variability, or state change.


There is no posterior dominant rhythm.


There are no sleep transients.


There is severe generalized slowing.


There is no focal slowing.


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) central (Cz max) spike-wave. At times these have centro-temporal field
(C4-T4 max)

2. Occasional (>1/10s to <1/min) right temporal (T4 max) spike-wave. At times these have diffuse bi-
hemispheric field


3. Occasional (>1/10s to <1/min) left frontal (Fp1 max) spikes

4. Occasional (>1/10s to <1/min) right frontal (Fp2 max) spikes


5. Occasional (>1/10s to <1/min) left frontal (Fp1 max) spikes. These occasionally occur in bursts of 5
Hz for 1-2 sec at a time, without definite evolution



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 70s





FINAL IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:


1. Multifocal spikes as above

2. Severe generalized slowing and disorganization.



FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are consistent with multifocal epileptiform potential.

There is additional evidence for a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.
