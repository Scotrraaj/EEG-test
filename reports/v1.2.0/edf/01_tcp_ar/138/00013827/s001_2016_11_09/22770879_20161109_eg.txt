HISTORY:

63 y.o. male with a history of depression, SI, alcohol abuse and HTN who
presented at home after a seizure, referred for routine EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.



MEDICATIONS: Ativan 2 mg in ED



SEDATION: as above



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record
due to near continuous muscle and movement artifact, and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a low voltage mixture of alpha and a
moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal, limited, awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic
events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal, limited, awake and drowsy  routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

A low voltage background can be seen in the setting of chronic alcohol use.
