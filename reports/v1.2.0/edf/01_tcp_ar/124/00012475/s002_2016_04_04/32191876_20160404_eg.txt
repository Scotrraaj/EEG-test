DATE OF STUDY: 04/04/2016

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 60 min - 3 hr, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 25 y.o. WOMAN FOLLOW UP 1 HOUR EEG ON 25

YR FEMALE WITH SEIZURES.  LAST SZ 2/16. PT RAN OUT OF MEDS. PT


LAST TOOK MEDS THURSDAY. LAST WEEK.


MEDICATIONS:


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2

times daily.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and




photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 10Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid

and anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing

during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Frequent focal sharp waves seen at F7/T3 during wakefulness and

mainly in sleep.


Some sharply contoured transients on the right anterior temporal


region.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Frequent left anterior temporal sharp waves mainly in sleep

2. Frequent left mid and anterior temporal focal slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG due to frequent

sharp waves in the left anterior temporal region which is

indicative of a potentially epileptogenic region. In addition

there is focal slowing in the left mid and anterior temporal


region. This is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which

is etiologically non-specific.
