DATE OF STUDY: 01/19/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 43 y.o. male with a history of R basal ganglia hemorrhage in the remote past,
no prior craniotomy, but seizure in Dec 2016  referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth nightly.

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth daily.


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily. Indications: Mixed Hyperlipidemia

divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth daily.

senna-docusate (SENNOSIDES-DOCUSATE SODIUM) 8.6-50 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth
daily.

docusate sodium (COLACE) 100 mg capsule, Take 100 mg by mouth 2 times daily.



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Faster frequency is higher amplitude and slightly more
vigorous on the right.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not sustained. No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Photic Stimulation: scant bilateral drivng is present.



EVENTS:There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE: A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION: This is a normal  routine EEG.  There are no epileptiform abnormalities detected.
The amplitude asymmetry noted is not pathological and may be correlated with imaging.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If further information is
needed please consider a sleep deprived or a one hour EEG.
