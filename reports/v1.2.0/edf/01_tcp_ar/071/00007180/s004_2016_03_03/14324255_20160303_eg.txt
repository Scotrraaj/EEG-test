HISTORY:

71 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy,

seizure free for two years referred for routine EEG for


characterization of seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

Calcium Carbonate (OS-CAL) 500 mg calcium (1,250 mg) Tablet,

Chewable,


lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 20 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth

every other day.

meloxicam (MOBIC) 15 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


diltiazem (CARDIZEM LA) 180 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 180 mg by

mouth.

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 100 mg by mouth 2


times daily.




allopurinol (ZYLOPRIM) 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth.

HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE PO, Take 12.5 mg by mouth. Unknown dose-check


with patient.

diltiazem (CARDIZEM CD) 180 mg 24 hr capsule,


Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, 1,000 unit Capsule,


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and


amplitude is present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild intermittent generalized slowing is present.

Focal slowing is present: intermittent R>L slowing with irregular


delta



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional (1/hour to <1min)  R anterior or mid temporal sharp


waves



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Sharpy contoured activity


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: accentuates the right temporal focal


slowing


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which


is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. R anterior temporal sharp waves


2. R temporal focal slowing

3. Shifting slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with a focal

mechanism for seizures. This is similar to a 2013 study.
