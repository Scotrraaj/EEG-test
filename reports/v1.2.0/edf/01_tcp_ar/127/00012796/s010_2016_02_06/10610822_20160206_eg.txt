HISTORY: 51 y.o. male who presents with a change in mental status in the setting of persistent hypoglycemia, referred for EEG for evaluation of episodes of right gaze deviation, intermittent twitching, and persistent altered mental status  MEDICATIONS: phenytoin  SEDATION: None listed  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  Admitting team was asked to mark the record during suspicious episodes.   DAY 1 (2/6/2016, 12:56 - 2/7/2016 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, and reactive. A definite waking background is not seen as on the previous study (2/4-2/5/16). Background consists of a mixture of poorly organized theta and delta, with no posterior dominant rhythm.  Well-formed sleep transients are not seen.  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  There is moderate-severe generalized slowing. There is no focal slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Abundant diffuse sharp waves with triphasic morphology are seen during sleep, frequently continuous at 1 Hz for runs <10 sec (GPDs). As the record progresses on this day, these discharges become continuous at 0.5-1 Hz and shift in predominance across the hemispheres, developing rhythmic aftergoing slow waves (GPD+R).   EVENTS:   Review of record reveals periods of right hemispheric tonic muscle artifact followed by diffuse tonic muscle artifact, then diffuse clonic muscle artifact.   2/6 at 13:44, 14:43, 15:18, 16:34, 16:55, 17:37, 18:53, 19:15, 19:51, 20:47, 21:19, 21:34, 21:44, 22:44, 23:27, 23:50 2/7 at 00:04, 00:22, 00:44, 01:12, 01:29, 02:03, 02:11, 02:42, 03:14, 04:05, 05:08, 05:39  CLINICAL: On video review, the patient has subtle intermittent rightward twitching movements of the head and/or eye flutter. For some episodes (i.e., 14:43) the correlate is more prominent on video than others (i.e., 16:34, during which pt is undergoing a sterile procedure and the proceduralist does not note a clinical change). Patient is not on camera at 16:55. There is no clear clinical correlate for 18:53 (note that camera is viewing patient's right side). For 19:15, 20:47, 21:21, 21:34 episodes, there are isolated body jerks with intermittent possible left gaze deviation. Note that at 21:34 and 21:44, staff are in room and do not appear to note a change from baseline. At 21:46, when staff is not blocking camera, semi rhythmic twitching of the head is noted at end of episode. For the 01:29 event, fast twitching of head and trunk are seen. For the 04:05 event, RIGHT gaze deviation is seen. For the 05:08 event, clonic jerking of left side is seen.  Overall, these episodes are clinically undetected by treating team on this day.  EEG: at first the most prominent change is one of artifact: the record is obscured by tonic muscle artifact, first over the right hemispheric leads, then spreading more diffusely after 10-15 seconds, and quickly punctuated by diffuse clonic muscle artifact.  As the day progresses, these periods of artifact are more reliably preceded by a change in the epileptiform activity to sharply contoured generalized rhythmic delta activity at 1 Hz (GPD+S).  GPD+S is more prominent over the right temporal chain for 20:47 episode. As the day further progresses, subtle evolution of rhythmic delta activity (1 Hz, increasing to 3.5 Hz slow waves) is seen over the right hemisphere preceding the artifact - a good example is 05:08.  Postictally, there is at first no postictal change in background. As day progresses, background becomes increasingly attenuated for several minutes after each episode.   EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 90s-100s.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate-severe generalized slowing and poor organization. 2. Continuous diffuse sharp waves with triphasic morphology at 1 Hz (GPD / GPD+R) 3. Electrographic episodes described above with at first subtle clinical correlate, but which are most consistent with seizures  Ongoing seizures are noted.  Other findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Sharp waves with triphasic morphology are most likely reflective of hyper excitable state.   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (2/7/2016, 06:00 - 2/8/2016, 06:00)  MEDICATIONS: Loaded with VPA 40 mg/kg on 2/7 ~9 am Versed drip is started at 23:30 on 2/7 and titrated up to 1 mg/kg/hr.  BACKGROUND: with uptitration of versed, background becomes discontinuous with frequent 1-second periods of diffuse attenuation  GENERALIZED SLOWING: severe  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: diffuse sharp waves with triphasic morphology become lower in amplitude and blunter in morphology, but continue at 0.5-1 Hz.  EVENTS:   Review of record reveals periods of right hemispheric tonic muscle artifact followed by diffuse tonic muscle artifact, then diffuse clonic muscle artifact.   2/7 at 06:03, 06:22, 07:04, 07:26, 07:50, 08:14, 08:18, 14:31, 16:42, 18:02, 18:55, 19:11, 20:41, 21:49  CLINICAL:   Overall, these episodes are clinically undetected by treating team until 07:04.  For the 07:04 event, RIGHT head and upward eye deviation is seen with diffuse clonic jerking. For the 07:26 and 08:18 events, LEFT clonic jerking and eye flutter are seen. Other episodes have much more subtle correlate, with tonic clenching and clonic movements of jaw, eye flutter, with or without a postictal yawn.  EEG: similar findings as on previous day  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s.   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Seizures as described above, electrographically diffuse at times, with lead-in over the right hemisphere at other times. Following administration of Versed background slows further and seizures cease, but periodic generalized sharp waves persist.   ----------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------  DAY 3 (2/8/2016, 06:00 - 2/9/2016, 06:00)  MEDICATIONS: VPA Versed  BACKGROUND: Diffuse low amplitude delta seen with the absence of a PDR or any normal anterior to posterior gradient.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: severe  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) at times with triphasic morphology at 0.5-1 Hz.
