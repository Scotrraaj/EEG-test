HISTORY: 51 y.o. male who presents with a change in mental status in the setting of persistent hypoglycemia, referred for EEG for evaluation of episodes of right lip twitching, right gaze deviation, and posturing movements of bilateral upper extremities.  MEDICATIONS: LOVENOX, PROTONIX. Loaded with fosphenytoin 20 mg/kg.  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.   DAY 1 (2/3/2016, 21:27 - 2/4/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, and reactive. The waking background consists of a mixture of theta, alpha, and delta, with an anterior-posterior gradient that is present but suboptimal. Fragments of an irregular posterior dominant rhythm approaching 6-7 Hz are seen.  Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by further slowing of the background. Well-formed sleep transients are not seen.  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  There is mild-moderate generalized slowing. There is no focal slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Abundant diffuse sharp waves with triphasic morphology are seen during sleep, frequently continuous at 1 Hz for runs <10 sec (GPDs).  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 70s-80s.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization. 2. Abundant diffuse frontally-predominant sharp waves with triphasic morphology, frequently continuous at 1 Hz for runs <10 sec (GPDs), activated by sleep  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Sharp waves with triphasic morphology are commonly associated with toxic-metabolic disorders, but may also be seen in hyperexcitable states. Clinical correlation is advised.  Background appears similar to that captured during a routine EEG performed on 12/13/2015.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (2/4/2016, 06:00 - 2/5/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Abundant diffuse frontally-predominant sharp waves with triphasic morphology, frequently continuous at 1 Hz for runs <10 sec (GPDs), activated by sleep 2. Frequent diffuse posterior quadrant sharp waves with triphasic morphology, with shifting predominance between the hemispheres  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in 80s-90s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  unchanged from day 1, with addition of diffuse posterior quadrant sharp waves with triphasic morphology, with shifting predominance between the hemispheres.   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (2/5/2016, 06:00 - 2/5/2016, 09:07)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Unchanged from day 2     -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization. 2. Abundant diffuse frontally-predominant sharp waves with triphasic morphology, frequently continuous at 1 Hz for runs <10 sec (GPDs), activated by sleep 3. Frequent diffuse posterior quadrant sharp waves with triphasic morphology, with shifting predominance between the hemispheres  FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Sharp waves with triphasic morphology are commonly associated with toxic-metabolic disorders, but may also be seen in hyperexcitable states. Clinical correlation is advised.  There were no electrographic seizures captured.
