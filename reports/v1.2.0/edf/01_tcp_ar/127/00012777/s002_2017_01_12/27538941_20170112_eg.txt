HISTORY:

33 y.o. male with a history of medically refractory epilepsy, recent traumatic SAH
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.


Seizure semiology:

1. Pain in his eye. He is unable to speak. He stares to the LEFT. He falls to the ground and has a
convulsion. BL tongue biting. Urinary incontinence. Severe agitation afterwards. Prolonged post-ictal
recovery.



2. Minor event: walks or speaks out of the context

3. Hx TC seizure

MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) tablet 120 mg

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 1,000 mg


mirtazapine (REMERON) tablet 30 mg

phenytoin (DILANTIN) ER capsule 400 mg

topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 200 mg


albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) inhaler 2 puff


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) tablet 400 mg


TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation. Posterior head rocking artifact
is seen.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.

Sleep includes brief spindles


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Wicket and EOM artifact in left >R
temporal region in drowsy



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.




EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE: A heart rate of  78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. Previously noted R TIRDA was not seen. EMU
recording to follow.
