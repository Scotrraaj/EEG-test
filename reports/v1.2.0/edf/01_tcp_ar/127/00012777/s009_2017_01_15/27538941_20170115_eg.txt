HISTORY:

This is a 33 y.o. right handed male admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: refractory epilepsy.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Recording of seizures for presurgical evaluation.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION: None



DAY 1 (1/12/2017, 17:22 - 1/13/2017, 06:00)


BACKGROUND:



The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes.




No generalized slowing is present.

There is occasional right temporal polymorphic slowing, at times with a posterior-predominant field.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Occasional runs of right temporal rhythmic delta activity at 1.5-2 Hz for <10 seconds at a time
(TIRDA also known as LRDA)



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.



EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 80s



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal video EEG due to:

1. Occasional right temporal polymorphic slowing, at times posterior-predominant



2. Occasional runs of right temporal rhythmic slowing



These findings are consistent with right temporal epileptogenic potential superimposed on a right
temporal (posterior predominant) dysfunction, either structural or physiologic in origin.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patients interictal findings were notable for a 9 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm, with occasional right temporal (posterior predominant) polymorphic slowing. Rarely, left
temporal polymorphic slowing was noted. In sleep, rare-to-occasional right temporal rhythmic delta
activity with rare right anterior temporal sharp waves in sleep were noted.





ICTAL FINDINGS:


A single clinical event was captured on 1/15/17 @ 22:41, consistent with the patient's typical
habitual "aura" behind his left eye. There were no EEG changes during this event.



No other clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. No seizures captured



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. No seizures captured




CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 8 days with continuous video EEG.
This was an elective EMU monitoring session for a presurgical evaluation of medically refractory
epilepsy.










The interictal EEG is characterized by a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with occasional right
temporal (posterior predominant) polymorphic slowing, rare left temporal polymorphic slowing
(consistent with right > left temporal dysfunction, structural or physiologic in etiology), and
occasional-to-rare right temporal epileptogenic potential.




The patient was weaned off Dilantin and Keppra completely and partially weaned off phenobarbital
over the course of his admission. Unfortunately, only one episode ("aura") was captured, without
associated EEG changes, before the patient expressed desire to be discharged. He was restarted on
his home antiepileptic medications (with the exception of Dilantin) on the day prior to his discharge
from the hospital. No other medication changes were made during the hospitalization.





The EEG findings taken as a whole are suggestive of a focal mechanism to this patient's seizures.
