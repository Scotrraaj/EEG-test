 HISTORY: a 46 y.o. male with a history of pineal cyst, head trauma referred for EEG for evaluation for subclinical status epilepticus.  

MEDICATIONS: 

SEDATION: 50 propofol, 4 versed, fentanyl, dilantin, keppra, ativan  

TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   

DAY 1 (5/29/2016 11:30pm - 5/30/2016 11:00am)  

BACKGROUND: The EEG begins after the patient has been intubated and sedated. Mixed frequency background rich in alpha and beta frequency activity. Some bursts of frontal delta are noted. Gradually, patient is more awake, moving. With stimulation, eye movements are seen. As the recording continues, despite electrode artifact the EEG is transitioning more to an alpha and theta pattern.  Patient was extubated on the morning of May 30th around 9 am and placed on a nonrebreather mask. A drowsy pattern with muscle and generous beta was noted.  Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.  The background is reactive and variable.  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  

EVENTS: None  

EKG: A single lead captured 80-90 bpm  

DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Replacement of the normal background by a pharmacological pattern.
