HISTORY:

66 y.o. female with a history of ICH

referred for routine EEG for 66 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH


EPISODE OF LOC LASTING 2-3 MIN WITH POSTICTAL CONFUSION. PER

HUSBAND PT HAD SIMULAR EVENT IN DEC. PMHX SIG FOR LT THALAMIC ICH

IN 3/2015 AND AND LT OPTHALMIC ARTERY ANEURYSM S/P COILING


3/2015. Encephalomalacia and gliosis at the site of a prior left

basal  ganglia and thalamic hemorrhage.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

warfarin (COUMADIN) 5 mg tablet,


simvastatin (ZOCOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth nightly.

calcium carbonate-vitamin D3 1,000 mg(2,500 mg)-800 unit Tablet,

Take  by mouth.






current facility-administered medications for this visit:

Trileptal



SEDATION: none



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.  The patient was markedly


confused during the EEG


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is asymmetric with prominent arrhythmic


delta activity from the left hemisphere.  The right hemisphere

includes mixed often theta frequency activity with a glimpse of a


7 Hz alpha rhythm.

The left hemisphere includes arrhythmic delta activity and sharp

waves, relatively high amplitude with variable phase reversal

including left frontal or temporal or T5 P3.  Some of the


discharges are periodic.

There are rare sharp waves on the right as well.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements is noted.  In

addition, there is prominent dropout of faster frequency activity

in the left hemisphere before the right




Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not

performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION: Abnormal due to:

Continuous arrhythmic delta activity from the left hemisphere.

Sharp waves from the left hemisphere, in the context of a breach

rhythm


Periodic sharp waves on the left

Mild slowing on the right



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a very epileptiform EEG in a patient with poor

responsiveness and baseline aphasia.  No seizures were recorded


The findings were discussed with the clinical team.  Continuous

EEG monitoring may be considered
