HISTORY:

48 y.o. female with a history of memory loss referred for routine EEG for
memory loss and MVA in July, 2013.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 600 mg tablet,

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.


PEG 400-Propylene Glycol (SYSTANE) 0.4-0.3 % Drops, Apply  to eye.

hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

polyvinyl alcohol (LIQUIFILM TEARS) 1.4 % ophthalmic solution, Place 1 drop into both eyes as
needed.

MOMETASONE FUROATE (NASONEX NA), Inhale  into the nose.

fluticasone (FLOVENT HFA) 110 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every 12 hours.

ALBUTEROL SULFATE (VENTOLIN HFA IN), Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs 3 times daily as needed.


amlodipine (NORVASC) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily.




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

Occasional Left temporal polymorphic focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no change in the background activity to visual, auditory,
tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and
produces no effect, she felt tingling in her fingers during hyperventilation.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Occasional Left temporal polymorphic focal slowing




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of left temporal dysfunction, which is etiologically non specific.
Similar findings were seen on EEG performed on 10/2015 and 04/2015.


Note that hyperventilation produced tingling in the fingers; this clinical sign had no EEG correlate.
