HISTORY:

26 YR OLD MALE P/W ALTERED MENTAL STATUS.

AT BASELINE PT NOTED TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER YES/NO. NO WITNESS SZ.



PMHX:

PARAPLEGIA 2/2 GSW WITH TBI


RECURRENT UTI

SZ D/O

CHRONIC HYPOTHERMIA


VDRF




MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA







SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes was performed

utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory

record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background consist of a diffuse delta/theta activity


that is disorganized and lacks the normal anterior to posterior

gradient.


No normal sleep is seen.



The right fronto central (F4/F8) region reveals continuous focal


slowing and attenuation.


There is nearly continuous focal slowing in the left central

region (C3).





PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:



The EEG revealed 4 electrographic seizures: The seizures commence


with a crisp beta discharge at C4/Cz that evolve in frequency to

alpha and have a concurrent increase in amplitude. They remain

mainly over the right central region and last ~ 1 - 3.5 minutes.



There is no video correlate seen during the seizures.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation and Photic Stimulation:  Not performed.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1. Right central electrographic status epilepticus.


2. Continuous focal slowing and attenuation in the right frontal

region.


3. Nearly continuous focal slowing in the left central region.

4. Moderate diffuse slow.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a very abnormal routine EEG which reveals right central

electrographic status epilepticus. There is additional continuous


focal cerebral cortical dysfunction in the right frontal region,

which is consistent with the known injury. There also nearly

continuous focal cerebral dysfunction in the left central region,

which has a high correlation with an structural lesion in that


region. Lastly, there is evidence of moderate diffuse cerebral

dysfunction which is non-specific with regards to etiology.
