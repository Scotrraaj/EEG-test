MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA , Ativan, Phenobarbital






Continuous video EEG with 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)

recording using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes was performed

utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory


record and included a single channel of EKG.  Seizure and spike

detection software was utilized.

-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 1 (08/31/2015 17:00 - 09/01/2011, )



BACKGROUND:

The background consist of a diffuse delta/theta activity

that is disorganized and lacks the normal anterior to posterior

Gradient. No normal sleep is seen.



The right fronto central (F4/F8) region reveals continuous focal


slowing and attenuation.


There is intermittent  focal slowing in the right posterior

quadrant


Region.

GENERALIZED SLOWING: marked



FOCAL SLOWING: R posterior/central intermittent and left

Frontocental



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY none significant



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare (<1hour)


EVENTS:



Seizures: electrographic seizures: The seizures are frequent in

the initial hours of recording, commence


with a crisp beta or alpha  discharge at C4/Cz that evolve in

frequency to


alpha and have a concurrent increase in amplitude. They remain

mainly over the right central region and last ~30 seconds - 3.5


minutes. The are associated  With intermittent left eye blink. As

the recording continues, ictal pattern changes to alpha more than


beta.

Later, left eye blink is seen without the ictal signature

EKG: A single EKG lead captured 84 BPM




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


Electrographic seizures transition from multiple to hour to

intermittent. Later Ictal patterns are more blunted.

EOMS may be seen without EEG change later in the first day of

recording. .





-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 2 ( 09/01/2015, 06:00 - 09/01/2015, 06:00)



BACKGROUND: The background consist of a diffuse delta/theta

activity

that is disorganized and lacks the normal anterior to posterior


Gradient. No normal sleep is seen.



GENERALIZED SLOWING: marked


FOCAL SLOWING: continuous, L frontal, intermittent R posterior.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



EVENTS: Seizures: electrographic seizures: Intermittent seizures

are noted between 6-8:30 AM and  commence


with a crisp beta or alpha  discharge at F4/C4/Cz that evolve in

frequency to


alpha and have a concurrent increase in amplitude. They remain

mainly over the right fronto -central region and last ~30 seconds

- 1.5

minutes. The are associated  with unilateral left eye blink. As


the recording continues, ictal pattern changes to alpha more than

Beta.  Additionally, ictal patterns are more subtle, may end with


theta or repetitive low voltage R frontal sharps.

Seizures seem to be stopping at 9 AM, and only two additional

well defined electrographic seizures were seen in the subsequent

hours.


EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60-80




DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

Seizures much improved after 9 AM, and markedly reduced after

noon. Given the low voltage ictal pattern, subtle or brief


discharges can be overlooked by scalp EEG.



DAY 3 (09/02/2015 6 AM  - 09/02/2015, noon )

MEDICATIONS:


KEPPRA , Ativan, Phenobarbital

BACKGROUND:


The waking background consist of a diffuse delta/theta activity

that is disorganized and lacks the normal anterior to posterior

Gradient. No normal sleep is seen.

There is  continuous focal slowing in the left central


region (C3).

The right fronto central (F4/F8) region reveals continuous focal


slowing and attenuation.  There is intermittent  focal slowing in

the right posterior


quadrant

GENERALIZED SLOWING: marked



FOCAL SLOWING:  Left Frontocental more marked than R posterior,


intermittent.


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY none significant



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare (<1hour)



EVENTS: none identified.


Seizures: none



EKG: A single EKG lead captured 84 BPM




DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION and overall IMPRESSION

and CLINICAL CORRELATION



Electrographic seizures appear to have stopped. The initial

seizures were very low voltage.  Thus, subtle seizures may be


overlooked using this scalp technique. Though the patient has

limited MSE, he seems to be more active and is moving about by

Sept 2, 2015.
