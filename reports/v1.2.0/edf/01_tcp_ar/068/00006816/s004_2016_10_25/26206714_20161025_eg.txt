HISTORY:

53 y.o. female with a history of medically refractory temporal lobe ups C,
previous EEG monitoring.  Currently seizure-free.  Today, referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

albuterol (PROAIR HFA) 90 mcg/Actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every 6 hours as
needed.

alendronate (FOSAMAX) 70 mg tablet, Take 70 mg by mouth every 7 days.

levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH TWICE DAILY



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.

In wakefulness and drowsiness, there is subtle left anterior temporal focal slowing characterized by
rhythmic mixed theta delta.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: This is muscle artifact and beta


Photic Stimulation: Vigorous driving with harmonic and super harmonic driving identified



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep  1 hour  EEG due to:

1.  Left anterior temporal rhythmic slowing, intermittent wake and drowsy.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Although there is significant artifact noted in
the background including the left temporal electrodes, this study is interpretable.  In contrast to
previous studies, no seizures were recorded in the room no sharp waves or spikes
