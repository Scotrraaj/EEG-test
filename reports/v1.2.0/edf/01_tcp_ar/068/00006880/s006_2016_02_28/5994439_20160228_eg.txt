HISTORY:

58 y.o. male with a history of post traumatic

epilepsy and acute intracerebral hemorrhage (cavernoma)  referred


for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.  Impaired

mental status.

SEDATION: None reported



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded

using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and


utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory

record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile


stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is somewhat disorganized and somewhat


asymmetric, but reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and

a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a


normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is

characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior

dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye

opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


Mild generalized slowing is present.

Shifting focal slowing is present, R Frontocentral maxiumum.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Infrequent discrete frontal  F8 FP2 sharps



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: tactile stimuli results in an alerting.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an  abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG.

1. R frontal discrete sharp waves.


2. Shifting focal slowing, more remarkable on the right.

3. Mild disorganization


There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or

detected.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This EEG may be correlated with imaging.  The discrete frontal

sharps may be part of the TBI pattern.


LTM 16-52 will follow.
