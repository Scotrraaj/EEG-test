History:		45 year old man with a history of seizures since childhood. He now reports increase in his headache frequency.
Medications:	DILANTIN, GABAPENTIN, TRAMADOL, AMBIEN. TOPAMAX, ELAVIL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a low amplitude 9-9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becom.es intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. Patient very rapidly transitions to stage II sleep.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with variable cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. Continuous EKG artifact is present.

Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Patient rapidly transitions from wakefulness to sleep - consider assessing for the underlying sleep disorder.
