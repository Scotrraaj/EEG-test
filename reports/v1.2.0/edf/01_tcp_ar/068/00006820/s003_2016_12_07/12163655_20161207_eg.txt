HISTORY:

This is a 46 y.o. with seizures since he was a young child, that involved grinding his teeth.



He has had these current seizures for about 2 years now but they have been increasing in frequency
over this time.




Seizure types:

1.) Sudden loss of consciousness with generalized convulsions lasting 2 to 5 minutes associated with
tongue biting and incontinence of urine. Afterward, he is drowsy and confused for about 10 minutes.
Frequency: 2 sz per week (was 4 last time). Last sz was last week.








2.) After sleeping, the pt sometimes awakes the following morning with right face swelling and tooth
pain from grinding his teeth, and sometimes bites his tongue. He sometimes remembers shaking his
head during the night.





Epilepsy Risk Factors:

+Pt has a history of meninginitis at 2 months of age

+Pt has a history of major head trauma after falling off of a bike at age 12 year old.


+Pt's father also had seizures

-No complications during birth. Denies history of head trauma, previous CNS infection, febrile
seizures or developmental delay.

EEG routine10/28/2015


Normal awake and asleep


DT EEG 48 hrs


START DATE & TIME OF STUDY: May 18, 2016

END DATE & TIME OF STUDY: May 20, 2016

Normal awake and asleep.



Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Characterization of seizures.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patientÂ’s exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION: None



DAY 1 (12/07/2016, 18:16  - 12/8/2016, 08:00)

Topamax 50mg q12hr


Depakote 500mg q12hr



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.







DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This a normal awake and asleep EEG.

EVENTS:




At 9:49 the patient starts grinding his teeth and seconds later pushes the button. At the technician
comes in to ask him if he is ok he start to twitch his upper body irregularly and the start to have
irregular twitching and jerking motion of his entire torso while keeping his eyes closed. He is tested
and does not follow verbal or motor commands. This behavior last for 5 minutes. About three minutes
after the shaking stops he follows commands and states he doesn't remember what happened. He
did state later that he remembered pressing the button and it felt like his typical event.





The EEG during this event was normal.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This a normal awake and asleep EEG. The event captured above had no EEG correlate and is
consistent with a psychogenic non-epileptic event.


-------------------------------------------------------



INDUCTION PROCEDURES:

none



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:

Interictal Findings:

None



Ictal Findings:

The patient had one clinical event while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the
epilepsy monitoring unit.




SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Non-epileptic events.



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Psychogenic non-epileptic events.



CONCLUSION:



was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 3 days with continuous
video EEG.  This was a diagnostic EMU monitoring session because of one non epileptic event was
captured.




The patient was weaned off topiramate over the course of his admission. He was sent on Depakote on
the day of discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes were made during the
hospitalization.



The patient had a discussion about nonepileptic events and their association with
underlying psychiatric co-morbidities and are not due to abnormal electrical discharges of the
brain/cortex.




We recommend that he/she to see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying
psychopathology and diagnosis.



Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.



I have personally reviewed and interpreted this study, and this report represents my findings and
conclusions.
