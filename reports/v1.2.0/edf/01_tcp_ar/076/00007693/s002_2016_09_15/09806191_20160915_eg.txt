DATE OF STUDY: 09/15/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only




HISTORY:

 a 53 y.o. male with a history of congenital deafness, CKD, HTN, HTN, HLD
, epilepsy,?  Other developmental anomalies.  Recent seizure.  Now, referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures. Hx of CVA with Chronic infarcts in the left frontal lobe, and bilateral
parietal lobes



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


famotidine (PEPCID) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

carvedilol (COREG) 3.125 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).

pravastatin (PRAVACHOL) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:     Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 50 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
