SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient was poorly relaxed with a large amount of muscle artifact and frontal eye movement
artifact throughout the record. The waking demonstrates a large amount of generalized low to
medium amplitude 16-25 Hz activity and a small amount of low to medium voltage posteriorly
dominant 10-12 Hz rhythmic activity.  Posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) attenuates symmetrically with
eye opening.





Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:






Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 76 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
