HISTORY:

31 y.o. male with a history of GSW to the head referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL XR) 400 mg 12 hr tablet, 1 in AM 1 at mid-day and  2 in PM
Indications: 400 mg in am and afternoon, 800 mg at night


gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 600 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily.

amitriptyline (ELAVIL) 150 mg tablet, 1 TABLET AT BEDTIME -MAY CAUSE DROWSINESS -DO
NOT TAKE WITH ALCOHOL


albuterol (VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, -SHAKE WELL BEFORE USING- INHALE BY
MOUTH 2 PUFFS 4 TIMES A DAY



SEDATION: none



TECHNIQUE:



Please note that this patient has a left frontal skull defect. A Digital Video 21 channel
electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2
electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a
single channel of EKG, photic stimulation and hyperventilation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a breech rhythm with accentuation of the
amplitude of the left sided activity. There is a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta
frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Mild generalized slowing is present with mild excess theta.

Nearly continuous focal slowing is present in the left fronto-temporal region, with disruption of the
faster frequencies, and a mixture of theta and delta.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Sharply contoured activity is seen but this patient has a breech rhythm secondary to a skull defect.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: 2



Hyperventilation: accentuates focal slowing on the left


Photic Stimulation: scant driving response



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.






IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:


1. Nearly continuous slowing from the left fronto-temporal region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are congruent with a structural abnormality on the left. No epileptiform activity is
noted, and this EEG is similar to other past studies.
