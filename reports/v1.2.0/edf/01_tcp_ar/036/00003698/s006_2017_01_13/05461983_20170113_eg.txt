HISTORY: a 67 y.o. FEMALE WITH PMHX OF LEFT SIDED WEAKNESS, HTN, DM, CVA 2001 SZS AND VP SHUNT. PRESENTS NOW WITH CONCERN FOR POSTICTAL STAT PT NON-VERBAL RESPOND TO STIM.
MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 24 hr tablet 500 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion amlodipine (NORVASC) tablet 5 mg aspirin EC tablet 81 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg sertraline (ZOLOFT) tablet 100 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 20 mg hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) tablet 25 mg insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 50 Units dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg insulin lispro (Humalog) injection 2-10 Units
SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record until 3:30 AM after which multiple electrodes were lost and included a single channel of EKG.
DAY 1 (01/13/2017, 13:34 - 1/14/2017, 09:30AM)
BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontotemporal region.  Sleep was seen.
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Rare (<1hour) right anterior temporal sharp waves.
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured 66
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to continuous focal slowing and rare sharp waves in the right frontotemporal region. This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability in this region, likely structural in origin. In addition there is mild to moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
