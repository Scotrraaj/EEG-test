SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured.


Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. At times these are very sharply contoured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


1. Continuous right anterior temporal focal slow waves at times sharply contoured.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal limited awake and drowsy routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the
right anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal structural cerebral dysfunction.
