SEDATION: meds as above



TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies


but with excess, sharply contoured frequent theta and delta

frequencies. There is a a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior

gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Brief seconds of sleep are characterized by synchronous and


symmetric vertex waves. Stage II sleep is not reached.


Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are multiple episodes of facial twitching captured.

Clinical: Tech notes

is seen on camera. Small mouth movements are captured that appear


subtle at best on video review. On clarification with the tech,

the facial twitching was predominantly left-sided (though


sometimes the right side of the face was affected

simultaneously).


EEG: Left hemispheric leads (and to a lesser extent right

anterior quadrant leads) become obscured by muscle artifact.


There is no clear change in EEG cerebral activity preceding or

following these episodes.


*Note: the patient reached stage I sleep for < 1 minute, making

assessment of whether the movements resolved in sleep difficult.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Multiple episodes of facial twitching as described above


without clear EEG cerebral correlate



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of mild diffuse cerebral

dysfunction.

Multiple episodes of predominantly left sided facial twitching


were captured, without clear EEG cerebral correlate; however,

surface negative seizures cannot entirely be excluded.


If clinically indicated, a repeat recording attempting to capture

stage II sleep could be of benefit to assess whether the

twitching resolves in stage II sleep.
