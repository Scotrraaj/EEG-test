HISTORY:

This is a 25 y.o. right handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: refractory epilepsy due to left temporal cavernoma.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;






- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patientÂ’s exam


- There have been reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a
"low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Additionally, T1 and T2 electrodes were placed in this patient.  Sphenoidal electrodes were not used
in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was
recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive.  Periods of
interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.







Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There is are two clinical events captured during this study.


Event 1


At 3:09:24PM the patient is sitting in bed looking at her computer. At 3:09:45PM she reaches for the
alarm bell and then turns her head to the right. She has apparent behavioral and speech arrest and
exhibits repetitive blinking. She appears disconnected from her mother who is talking to her. Her
mother holds her right hand. At 3:10:48PM the nurse asks where she is and she replies "Temple".
She smiles and rubs her eyes with her left hand (possible post-ictal variant of "nose wiping" sign). She
appears a bit lethargic but is returning to baseline. Electrographically, there is the onset of sharply
contoured left temporal theta-delta activity, maximal at T3, starting at approximately 3:09:43PM.
This evolves into more rhythmic delta activity over the left hemisphere and ends by 3:11:08PM.
There is residual left temporal slowing that persists for several minutes.






Event 2


At 4:14:13 PM the patient is sitting in bed looking at her computer. She reaches for and pushes the
alarm button and then closes her computer. She looks to the right and exhibits repetitive eye
blinking. Her mother holds her right hand. At 4:14:49PM she can repeat the code word "apple" and
state her name and age. She is clearly disconnected and staring into space. By 4:15:37PM she has
returned to clinical baseline. Electrographically, there is again the onset of sharply contoured left
temporal theta-delta activity, maximal at T3, starting at approximately 4:14:13PM. This evolves into
more rhythmic delta activity over the left hemisphere and ends by 4:15:32PM. There is residual
intermittent left temporal slowing that persists for several minutes after the end of the clinical seizure.






The patient was given 1mg oral lorazepam after the second seizure and was re-started on her
outpatient dose of Lamotrigine. In addition, she was begun on 100mg Zonisamide.



EKG: A single lead captured normal sinus rhythm.






Summary and impression:

The six day continuous video-EEG EMU admission demonstrated:


1) intermittent left temporal focal slowing

2) intermittent left temporal sharp waves maximal at T3-T5.


3) Two clinical and electrographic seizures emanating from the left temporal lobe.


This EMU evaluation is diagnostic of localization-related epilepsy with complex partial (focal
dyscognitive) seizures originating in the left temporal lobe. These results were communicated to the
patient and her family.


The patient was discharged on lamotrigine 300mg po BID and Zonisamide 100mg po qd. The
zonisamide will be titrated to 400mg po qd with continuation of the lamotrigine.




The patient will follow up in Neurology.
