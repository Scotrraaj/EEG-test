HISTORY:

30 y.o. female with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 300 mg tablet, Take 1.5 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.

divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily for 360 days.

ziprasidone (GEODON) 40 mg capsule, Take 40 mg by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).


alprazolam (XANAX) 1 mg tablet,

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) 30 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence 10 Hz PDR, unstable AP (anterior-to-
posterior) gradient, mild excess of diffuse polymorphic theta and excess diffuse beta activity.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep 1 hour routine EEG due to:


1. Mild diffuse slowing and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
