HISTORY:

58 y.o. WOMAN CC SEPTIC SHOCK, ACUTE

RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RENAL FAILURE


PT STILL NOT FOLLOWING COMMANDS

REPEAT EEG.



MEDICATIONS:

HEPARIN, INSULIN, ATROVASTATIN, ASA, FAMOTIDINE, NYSTATIN,

KEPPRA, AZTREONAM, TYLENOL



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically




satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

A posterior dominant rhythm at best reached 7 Hz. Background


activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta

activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior

gradient of frequencies.



Sleep is not captured but state changes are noted.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate diffuse background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal coma portable EEG due to moderate diffuse

background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are


etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral

dysfunction.
