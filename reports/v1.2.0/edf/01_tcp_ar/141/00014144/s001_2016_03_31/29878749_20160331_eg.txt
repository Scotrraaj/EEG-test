HISTORY:

58 y.o. female with a history of  somnolence,

found to have Multifocal bilateral small infarcts and bilateral


parietal

segmental infarcts, all age indeterminate concerning for an

embolic


etiology referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical

seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

INSULIN, HEPARIN, ATORVASTATIN, CEFTRIAXONE, NARCAN, FAMOTIDINE,

ZOFRAN, ASA



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:




A bedside portable ICU Digital Video 21 channel

electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International


10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system.

This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single


channel of EKG and tactile and auditory stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is characterized by a continuous, mixed frequency


diffusely slow pattern.  Slow delta activity was noted

particularly in the frontal regions.  Shifting slowing was noted.


Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta

activity

Sleep is not captured



Marked generalized slowing is present.

Shifting focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

A handful triphasic waves were noted



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile stimulation increases faster

frequency activity



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal ICU EEG due to:

1. marked generalized background slowing


2. Triphasic waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings supporting bihemispheric process as may be seen in


the context of embolic stroke.  The triphasic waves are

nonspecific, they're not particularly prominent but are often

seen in metabolic encephalopathy
