HISTORY:

66 y.o. male with a history of cerebrovascular disease who presents after a
seizure and altered mental status referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth at bedtime for 360 days.


levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 12 hours for 360 days.

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth 3 times daily for 360 days.

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.




UNKNOWN TO PATIENT, Indications: unknown insulin per EMS



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta with excess delta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present but suboptimal.




During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and diffuse
background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Occasional left hemispheric polymorphic slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:




There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization


2. Occasional left hemispheric polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of left hemispheric dysfunction superimposed
on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
