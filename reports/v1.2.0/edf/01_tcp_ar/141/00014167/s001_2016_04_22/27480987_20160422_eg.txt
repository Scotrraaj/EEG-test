HISTORY:

68 y.o. WOMAN R HANDED. PT ADMITED FOR

SECONDARY MALIG.NEOPLASM OF LIVER INTRAHEPATIC.



MEDICATIONS:

TRAZODONE, HEPARIN



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

poor record due to continuous muscle artifact  T3- C3 and T4

electrode misplacement, and included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


characterized by disorganized high amplitude diffuse delta and

theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior


gradient of frequencies.

Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology

are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms

demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.



Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Triphasic waves

2. Generalized slow waves, Moderate



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake only routine limited EEG due to

frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and moderate diffuse


background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a moderate

diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but


suggestive of a metabolic origin. Please note this is a limited

EEG due to movement and electrode artifact, no definitive focal


abnormalities can be ruled out.
