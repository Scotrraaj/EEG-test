HISTORY:

67 y.o. female with a history of breast

cancer, s/p resection, radiation, and chemotherapy 3/2009, with


metastases to bone, referred for routine EEG after presenting

with an episode of shaking and unresponsiveness lasting seconds

to minutes. Patient recently reported to have increasing


confusion and weakness.


MEDICATIONS: lovenox, oxycodone, morphine, Keppra



SEDATION: meds as above



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was at times a technically limited record,




with periods of muscle artifact obscuring both temporal chains.

The study included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The study opens to a disorganized mixture of delta with

occasional superimposed theta. Sleep architecture is absent.


When the patient is stimulated, the background becomes reactive,


consisting of low amplitude alpha, theta, and delta, with no

clear posterior dominant rhythm.


Drowsiness is characterized by further slowing of the background.


There is mild to moderate generalized slowing.

There is no definite focal slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal, somewhat technically limited, awake and

asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing and background

disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of mild to moderate diffuse

cerebral dysfunction.
