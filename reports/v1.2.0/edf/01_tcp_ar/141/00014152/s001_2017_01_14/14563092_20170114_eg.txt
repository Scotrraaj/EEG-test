START DATE OF STUDY: 01/14/17 at 13:13 END DATE OF STUDY: 01/14/2017 at 23:10  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 57 y.o. FEMALE WITH CC OF LEFT HAND MM AND LEFT EYE DEVIATION   CT. RIGHT FRONTOPARIETAL HYPODENSITY.  PT WITH CA ?BREAST  R/O SZS, BRAIN METS.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: midazolam (VERSED) 1 mg/mL injection sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB dexamethasone (DECADRON) injection 4 mg   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. Patient kept moving and unplugged the electrodes, the record had to be stopped.   DAY 1 (01/14/17, 13:13 - 1/14/2017, 23:10)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the fronto temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  State changes were seen.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Lateralized Periodic epileptiform discharges with polyspikes seen at F8 and T4 at a frequency of 1Hz.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured 102  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to right fronto temporal LPDs and focal slow waves, which are indicative of a focal region of structural dysfunction and irritability. In addition there is moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
