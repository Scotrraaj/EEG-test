HISTORY: 60 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy, admitted for laminectomy, who was found unresponsive and in cardiac arrest in his hospital room (last seen normal 1 hour prior) referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events (twitching of face, arms, trunk), screening for subclinical seizures and assessment of mental status change.  No hypothermia protocol.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion norepinephrine (LEVOPHED) 8 mg/250 mL (32 mcg/mL) in NSS infusion sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB tamsulosin (FLOMAX) 24 hr capsule 0.4 mg albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) inhaler 2 puff sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium phosphates (FLEET) enema 1 enema benzocaine-menthol (CHLORASEPTIC) lozenge 1 lozenge multivitamin (THERAPEUTIC-M) 9 mg iron-400 mcg per tablet 1 tablet  Upon assessment by neurology resident, given Ativan, Depakote 30 mg/kg, then Keppra  SEDATION: as above  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/10/2016, 21:03 - 11/11/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND, PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM), EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY, EVENTS:   The record opens to a suppressed background. There is no reactivity, variability, or state change.  At study start, there are relatively isolated twitching movements of face/trunk/arms occurring every 10-30 seconds.  This correlates with twitch artifact, which has no definite associated epileptiform activity (though this may be buried within artifact).  As study progresses, twitching artifact becomes continuous, occurring every 0.5-2 seconds, associated with continuous multifocal twitching of face/trunk/arms.  There is severe generalized slowing.   EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 70s-120s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing, with lack of reactivity, variability, or state change 2. Multifocal body twitches, occasional at start of study and becoming continuous throughout day 1, without definite epileptiform correlate  These findings are consistent with a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Twitching movements are clinically consistent with myoclonus, which may be of cortical or subcortical origin.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (11/11/2016, 06:00 - 11/12/2016, 06:00)  Patient started on propofol 35 mcg/kg/min, switched to midazolam 1.5 mg/hr over the course of the morning, eventually uptitrated to 2.5 mg/hr.  BACKGROUND, PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM), EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY, EVENTS:   Background remains suppressed with attenuated faster frequencies, but twitch artifact is near continuous.  At 10:40, vecuronium 8 mg is administered while the patient is observed by the team. Twitching movements and muscle artifact resolves, revealing 1 Hz generalized periodic discharges.  Gradually, twitch artifact returns superimposed over these discharges.  Over the course of the day, background develops scant low voltage theta. Generalized spikes occur every 1-4 seconds.  Intermittently the video is reviewed and no twitching is seen.  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Generalized periodic discharges as frequent as 1 Hz, correlating with twitching movements.  Twitching gradually resolves over course of day but generalized periodic discharges persist.  These findings are diagnostic for myoclonic status epilepticus.  There is additional evidence for severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (11/12/2016, 06:00 - 11/13/2016, 06:00)  Meds: Versed tapered down over course of day, discontinued 11/13 05:00  BACKGROUND, PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM), EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY, EVENTS:   Background consists of attenuated, disorganized theta and alpha without reactivity.  Generalized sharp waves occur every 1-10 seconds (generalized periodic discharges). Just after 11/13 05:00, they become as frequent as 2 Hz, but do not evolve.  No twitching No evolution of discharges  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s, with very frequent PVCs   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Similar findings to end of day 2 Generalized periodic discharges superimposed on severe diffuse slowing No twitching, and no evolution of discharges   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 4 (11/13/2016, 06:00 - 11/13/2016, 09:26)  BACKGROUND: No change compared with day 3  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No change compared with day 3  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 90s   DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change compared with day 3    -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Severe generalized slowing, with lack of reactivity, variability, or state change 2. Multifocal body twitching (myoclonic status epilepticus) correlating with generalized periodic discharges seen days 1-2 3. Generalized periodic discharges without twitch correlate, days 2-4   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are consistent with a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Myoclonus was confirmed as cortical in origin: it correlated with generalized epileptogenic potentials. Myoclonus resolved by day 2. Evidence for generalized epileptogenic potentials remains. These epileptogenic potentials did not evolve further into electrographic seizures.
