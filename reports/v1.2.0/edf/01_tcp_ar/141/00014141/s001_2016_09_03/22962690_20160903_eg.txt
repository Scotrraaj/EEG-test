HISTORY:

56 y.o. male with a history of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, depression,
confusion referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
theta >alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured


Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None

EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 50 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized background slowing and bradycardia





CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings  Are non-specific, no epileptiform features were seen
