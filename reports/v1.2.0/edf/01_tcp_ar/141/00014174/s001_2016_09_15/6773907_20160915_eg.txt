SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is characterized by the presence of generalized slowing, with diffuse, slow delta,
more rhythmic 2-3 Hz delta in the frontal regions, and scant rhythmic frontocentral theta is present.


No major  focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.




EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

Artifact, questionable external pacer is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1.  Marked generalized slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are frequently found in association with toxic or metabolic encephalopathy,
medication effect or other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  Correlation with imaging, lab
values in the overall clinical picture is suggested
