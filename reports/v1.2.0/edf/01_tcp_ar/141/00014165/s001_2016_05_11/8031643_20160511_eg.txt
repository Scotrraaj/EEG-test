SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.  Patient is agitated at times, so some of the impedences are
high.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a moderate amplitude 8 Hz theta activity,
poor AP gradient and diffuse excess polymorphic theta activity.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.






EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:




A heart rate of ~84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Mild diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.



The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
