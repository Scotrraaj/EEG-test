HISTORY: 68 y.o. male with a history of a recent heart transplant, now with shaking episodes.    MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Ativan prior to CT    SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG   DAY   BACKGROUND: There is no PDR or AP gradient. The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta activity, slow polymorphic delta activity, continuous broad triphasic-like waveforms and frequent periods of discontinuity.    With significant stimulation, such as suctioning, background voltages increases and triphasic-like waveforms seen during periods of quiescence increase in amplitude and become sharply contoured.  Sleep was not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: at least one event of interest is captured.  It starts at ~ 11:07:39 am and lasts nearly 3 minutes.  It starts while patient is being suctioned.  Patient is not well visualized on the camera (due to large amount of equipment in the room).  There appears to be some head shaking that is not continuous.  Electrographically, there is no abnormal ictal correlate, only change to more awake background described above in the background section of the report.     IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal ~12.5 hours long term video EEG due to: (1) moderate to severe diffuse slowing (2) triphasic waves  Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. Triphasic waves are a nonspecific EEG finding that can be seen in encephalopathy (mostly commonly hepatic), uremia, anoxia and many other etiologies.     At least one episode of interest is captured and is not associated with an abnormal ictal correlate.
