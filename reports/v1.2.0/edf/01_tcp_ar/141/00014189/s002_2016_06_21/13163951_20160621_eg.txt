DATE OF STUDY: 06/21/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 60 min - 3 hr (1 hr 28 min), awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 42 y.o. female with a history of episodes of loss of consciousness with
incontinence, eye rolling, and shaking, referred for routine EEG for characterization of paroxysmal
events.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

losartan (COZAAR) 25 mg tablet,

escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) 10 mg tablet,


zolpidem (AMBIEN) 10 mg tablet,

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 20 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

UNKNOWN TO PATIENT, lexapro


aspirin, buffered 81 mg Tablet, Take  by mouth.

CLONAZEPAM PO, Take 0.5 mg by mouth 3 times daily.

IBUPROFEN (MOTRIN PO), Take  by mouth.


LORazepam (ATIVAN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet ~30-60 minutes prior to the scan. May take another
tablet right before the scan.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles, and K complexes. Slow wave sleep is not seen.



No generalized slowing is present.


There is occasional left fronto-temporal sharply contoured theta-frequency slowing in drowsiness.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. The patient reports that she feels out of breath and
lightheaded after hyperventilation.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Occasional left fronto-temporal sharply contoured theta-frequency slowing in drowsiness



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of the presence of left fronto-temporal cerebral
dysfunction.




Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
