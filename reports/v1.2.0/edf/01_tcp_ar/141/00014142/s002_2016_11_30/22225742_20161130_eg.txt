HISTORY:

24 y.o. male with a history of drug use, now comes with myoclonic jerks,
concerning for seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg


valproate (DEPACON) 250 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion


vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+





SEDATION: propofol and ativan




TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.


The background consists of diffuse frontally predominant relatively monomorphic ~12 Hz activity with
underriding slow delta activity.




No normal sleep architecture is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal comatose sedated routine EEG due to:

1. Diffuse background slowing and lack of clear reactivity




CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate diffuse cerebral dysfunction that, in this case, is at least partially related to
the medication effect (propofol and ativan).  No movements of interest are captured on this study.



These findings were conveyed to the neurology team.
