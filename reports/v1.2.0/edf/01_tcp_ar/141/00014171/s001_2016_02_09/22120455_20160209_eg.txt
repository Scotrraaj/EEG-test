HISTORY:

58 y.o. female who was found down

unresponsive and coded for 20 minutes, referred for routine EEG


for assessment of mental status change.


MEDICATIONS: patient received Fentanyl 25 mcg during study



SEDATION: as above



TECHNIQUE:

Assessment of background activity is limited by constant muscle

artifact over the frontal and temporal regions, unchanged


following administration of fentanyl.  Bilateral

parieto-occipital regions demonstrate attenuated rhythms with no

clear reactivity, variability, or state change, although noxious


stimulation is not administered.





Spontaneous eyeblinks are present.



Severe generalized slowing is present.


There is no definite focal slowing.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


An irregular heart rate of 114 bpm is captured on a single EKG

lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal, though technically limited, asleep only

routine EEG due to:


1. Severe generalized slowing

2. Irregular heart rate of 114 bpm



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral

dysfunction.


This was a technically difficult record to interpret due to

constant muscle artifact over the bilateral frontal and temporal


regions.

If clinically warranted, a repeat study after administration of


neuromuscular blockade may be of value.

An irregular heart rate of 114 bpm is captured on a single EKG


lead.
