DATE OF STUDY: 09/08/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 84 y.o. male recently admitted to TUH after having 2-3 syncopal events which all
lasted about 5 min. No incontinence, No tongue biting. Per wife, pt passes out, head goes back, and
he gurgles.  Baseline memory and visual impairment but normal hearing. Wife felt he was confused
after spells. Completed LTM without seizures, no events since he started low dose keppra.

12 hours.

montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth nightly.


aspirin 81 mg chewable tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily. Indications: Prevention of Transient
Ischemic Attacks



TECHNIQUE:

A   1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of slow alpha with some
bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 6.7-7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. There is slowing in the frontotemporal region which is
seen more in the left than the right.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




In wakefulness, continuous rhythmic  generalized slowing is present.

There are two types of focal slowing noted:

1. Intermittent isolated bursts of L sharply contoured slowing- F7 - T3 max


2. More prolonged rhythmic slowing Left posterior temporal

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No definitive epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation: Hypervertilation is not performed.

Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  Occ PVCS



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG.  The background is slow with an alpha rhythm of
6.7 Hz.  There is slowing in the frontotemporal region, left greater than right.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

No definitive epileptiform features were seen. The slow background was previously identified.   It
supports a diffuse CNS process such as a dementia.


The focal slowing is non specific, but the rhythmic slowing described is sometimes seen in seizure
disorders.
