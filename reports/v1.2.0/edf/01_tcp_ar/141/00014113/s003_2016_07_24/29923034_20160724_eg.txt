HISTORY:


83 y.o. male with a history of "syncope" with prodrome of confusion, can't speak
during spells and is amnestic afterwards.  PVCS,  referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal
events.


MEDICATIONS:

Flecanide, Remeron, lopressor,others

SEDATION: none



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside continuous portable 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and seizure and spike detection
software



DAY 1 (7/24/2016 - 7/25/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND:


The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric,  well-organized, and consists predominantly of
theta with admixed alpha. It is a well organized but rhythmically slow pattern.



Posterior dominant rhythm was present- 7Hz.



The background is  reactive,  variable.



There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.


Sleep was limited, but includes includes vertex waves.  He was awake for much of the night.


Focal slowing: In drowsiness there are bursts of left temporal focal slowing, of 3-7 seconds duration
primarily in the AM on the 25th.

PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Wicket

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



EVENTS:



EKG: A single lead captured HR 80-90


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

1. Slowing of the background/slowing of the PDR

2. Left temporal focal slowing, of greater duration than expected as a normal variant.


Overall Summary:


No clinical events were recorded. The absence of epileptiform activity does not exclude a diagnosis
of epilepsy. The mild background slowing may be correlated with clinical features.
