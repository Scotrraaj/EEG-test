HISTORY:

83 YR OLD MALE R HANDED. PT HAD 2 EPISODES OF LOC. PER WIFE. PMHX. NO
H/O SZ


MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:






The waking background is characterized by a mixture of theta and alpha frequencies, with a
symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at best reaches 7 Hertz . The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequencies is absent.




During drowsiness, there is further slowing of frequencies and attenuation.


Limited sleep is characterized by symmetric vertex waves and sleep spindles. Slow wave sleep was
not captured.




Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F7 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Left fronto- temporal focal slowing

2. Moderate generalized slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the left
fronto-temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific. In addition there is moderate generalized slow waves which is indicative of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction and non-specific with regards to etiology.
