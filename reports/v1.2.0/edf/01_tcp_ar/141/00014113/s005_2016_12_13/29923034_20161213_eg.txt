SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Occasional left fronto-temporal (F7/T3 max) polymorphic slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.





Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 42-48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing


2. Occasional left fronto-temporal polymorphic slowing

3. Bradycardia captured in a single EKG lead



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of left fronto-temporal dysfunction
superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. These findings are similar to those reported in
multiple prior EEGs.


Please note the presence of bradycardia in this patient with possible syncope.
