HISTORY: 22 y.o. MALE TBI MVAS/P RIGHT HEMICRANI, VENTRIC.  PT WITH SZ IN CT SCAN  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: mannitol (OSMITROL) 20 % infusion 100 g sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion oxycodone (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 5 mg morphine injection 2 mg ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL sodium phosphates (FLEET) enema 1 enema multivitamin (THERA-M) w/minerals tablet [START ON 1/17/2017] enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg phenylephrine (NEO-SYNEPHRINE) 80 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL infusion folic acid (FOLVITE) tablet 1 mg thiamine (B-1) injection 300 mg fentanyl (SUBLIMAZE) 1 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion Lorazepam (ATIVAN) injection 4 mg phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB cefazolin (ANCEF) 2 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB acetaminophen (TYLENOL) suppository 650 mg   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  DAY 1 (1/14/2017, 18:14 - 1/15/2017, 9:40)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the parietal region.  Sleep was not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured 90  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximal in the parietal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin. In addition, there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
