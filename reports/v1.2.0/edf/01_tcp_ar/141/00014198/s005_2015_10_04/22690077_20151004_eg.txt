HISTORY:


38 y.o. Male with a history of HIV, PCP pneumonia,

HTN, and open heart surgery who presented with hypoxic

respiratory failure, AKI, and hypertensive urgency. LTM EEG is


requested to evaluate for altered mental status.


MEDICATIONS:


Off Versed as of 10/1/2015

Off propofol and fentanyl as of 10/2/2015 15:00



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the




International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.



DAY 1 (10/3/2015, 14:39 - 10/4/2015, 06:00)


BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous, symmetric, disorganized, and


consists of delta with occasional admixed theta frequencies.

At the day's onset, there are rare periods where the background


changes for < 5 minutes with a mixture of theta, alpha, and

admixed delta.

This change in frequencies becomes more continuous beginning at

about 03:00.


There is no clear reactivity or state change.



There is moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Note that the leads are diffusely obscured by muscle artifact

from 05:00-06:00 on this day.



There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare (<1hour) runs of diffuse sharp waves


with triphasic morphology at 2 Hz, for < 1 minute



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or

detected.


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

1. Moderate to severe diffuse slowing


2. Background disorganization

3. Lack of definite reactivity


4. Rare (<1hour) runs of diffuse sharp waves with triphasic

morphology at 2 Hz, for < 1 minute



These findings are consistent with moderate to severe diffuse


cerebral

dysfunction. Sharp waves with triphasic morphology are a

nonspecific finding, but are often seen in association with a

toxic-metabolic etiology.






-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 2 (10/4/2015, 06:00 - 10/5/2015, 06:00)


BACKGROUND: Consists of disorganized delta with admixed theta,

alternating with periods of disorganized delta with attenuated


faster frequencies.

Note that from 10/4/2015 10:00-10:45, 12:35-13:00, 10/4/2015


21:50 till 10/5/2015 05:30, and various other

periods ranging up to 10 min, on this day the background is

obscured by diffuse muscle artifact.



GENERALIZED SLOWING: Moderate



FOCAL SLOWING: None


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

1. Rare diffuse sharp waves with triphasic morphology



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s.





DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

This is an abnormal, though limited by muscle artifact, long term

video EEG due to:

1. Moderate diffuse slowing


2. Background disorganization

3. Rare diffuse sharp waves with triphasic morphology



These findings are consistent with moderate diffuse cerebral

dysfunction.

Sharp waves with triphasic morphology are a nonspecific finding,


but are often seen in association with a toxic-metabolic

etiology.








-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 3 (10/5/2015, 06:00 - 10/6/2015 03:57)


BACKGROUND: Consists of disorganized delta with admixed theta and


alpha alternating with periods of disorganized delta with

attenuated faster frequencies.


Note that study is discontinuous between 10/5/2015 08:45 till

12:08.  Beginning at 10/5/2015 18:05 the majority of the study is

obsured by periods of diffuse muscle artifact.



GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change



FOCAL SLOWING: None



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected


EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s-70s.




DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


This is an abnormal, though limited by muscle artifact, long term

video EEG due to:

1. Moderate diffuse slowning

2. Background disorganization



These findings are consistent with moderate diffuse cerebral


dysfunction.








-----------------------------------------------------------------


FINAL IMPRESSION:



This is an abnormal, somewhat limited by muscle artifact, long

term video EEG due to:



1. Moderate to severe diffuse slowing, which improves to moderate

by day 2

2. Background disorganization


3. Lack of definite reactivity on day 1 which resolves by day 2

4. Rare (<1hour) runs of diffuse sharp waves with triphasic


morphology at 2 Hz, for < 1 minute on day 1, which improve by day

2 and are no longer seen by day 3





FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are consistent with moderate to severe diffuse

cerebral dysfunction, improving to moderate diffuse dysfunction

by day 2.

Sharp waves with triphasic morphology are a nonspecific finding,


but are often seen in association with a toxic-metabolic

etiology. They are no longer seen by the end of the study.


There were no clinical or electrographic seizures reported or

detected during this study.
