HISTORY:

38 y.o. Male with a history of HIV, PCP pneumonia,

HTN, and open heart surgery who presented with hypoxic


respiratory failure, AKI, and hypertensive urgency. EEG is

requested to evaluate for altered mental status.



MEDICATIONS:

Off Versed as of 10/1/2015

Off propofol and fentanyl as of 10/2/2015 15:00



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The background consists of disorganized diffuse delta frequencies


with occasional admixed theta.

There is no reactivity to noxious stimulation. There is no

variability or state change.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no change in the background

activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not


performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing


2. Background disorganization

3. Lack of reactivity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral

dysfunction.
