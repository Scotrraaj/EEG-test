DATE OF STUDY: 09/11/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only




HISTORY:

 a 71 y.o. male with a history of repeated episodes of right hemiparesis, with no
evidence of CVA on neuroimaging, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg


famotidine (PEPCID) tablet 40 mg

clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg

potassium chloride (K-DUR) CR tablet 10 mEq


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

dextrose 50% injection 25 mL

dextrose 50% injection 50 mL


glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units



docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg

senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet


heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

hydrochlorothiazide (MICROZIDE) capsule 12.5 mg


amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 5 mg

topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 25 mg


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
