HISTORY:

25 y.o. male with a history of K2 related seizures, multiple seizures today referred
for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


SEDATION: Ativan before the test



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The EEG begins just after seizure, when the patient has received Ativan.  This is an initially a
diffusely slow pattern with generous beta.  Patient becomes a bit more arousable and a typical sleep
pattern emerges.  Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric
vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Stimulation of the patient produces in a brief arousal with eye opening and a beta alpha pattern.
9.75 Hz PDR,  but no real awakening is sustained



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  See above


EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE: A heart rate of 104 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal asleep only routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal asleep only routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
