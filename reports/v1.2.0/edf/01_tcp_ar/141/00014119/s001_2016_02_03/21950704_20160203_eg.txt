History:	58 year old woman who presents with change in mental status.
Medications:	DEXAMETHASONE, METOPROLOL, SYNTHROID
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of moderate amplitude polymorphic 
theta activity, frequent triphasics wavefoms and low amplitude underriding fast activity.  Patient 
remains awake throughout the recording.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
	Triphasic waves, frequent
	No electrographic seizures
	No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only portable 21-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and 
frequent triphasics waveforms. These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy,
 which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.  Triphasic waves are a 
nonspecific EEG finding that can be seen in hepatic encephalopathy, uremia and anoxia.
