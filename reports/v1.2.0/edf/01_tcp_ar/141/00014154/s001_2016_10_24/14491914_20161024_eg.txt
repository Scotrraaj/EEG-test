SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and theta activity and some intermixed alpha with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.



Sleep is not captured





Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 86 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Continuous right frontal focal slow waves.

2. Moderate generalized slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the right
frontal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely
structural in origin.


In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
