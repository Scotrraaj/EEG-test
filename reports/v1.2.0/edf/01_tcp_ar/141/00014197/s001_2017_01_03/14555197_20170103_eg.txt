HISTORY:

116 y.o. female who was in motor vehicle collision and is now unresponsive,
with scattered subarachnoid hemorrhage, referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status
change.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

chlorhexidine (PERIDEX) 0.12 % solution 15 mL

albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 2.5 mg


ipratropium (ATROVENT) 0.02 % nebulizer solution 0.5 mg

[START ON 1/4/2017] pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg

tetanus,diphth,pertus(acell) (BOOSTRIX) injection 0.5 mL


ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

fentaNYL (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection 100 mcg


lidocaine (XYLOCAINE) 20 mg/mL (2 %) injection 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

Much of the background consists of drowsiness/sleep.


During very brief periods of nonsustained wakefulness, the background is characterized by the
presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha and excess beta frequencies, with no clear
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and
amplitude is present but suboptimal.




During drowsiness, diffuse background slowing is seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with rudimentary synchronous and symmetric
vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. Suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which
may at least in part be associated with a poorly sustained wakeful state.
