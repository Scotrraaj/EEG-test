HISTORY:

24 y.o. female with a history of childhood epilepsy, eye flutter and psychosis
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth twice a day

risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) 4 mg tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth at bedtime



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:





A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alph, theta  and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7-10 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not sustained



Generalized slowing is present.  In addition, paroxysmal bursts of irregular bifrontal slowing are seen
in HV and intermittently.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

NONE



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

See above



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: elicits irregular bilateral slowing


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 50 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION: abnormal due to




1. Generalized background slowing

2. Poor organization


3. Excess theta

4. Bursts of paroxysmal slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG

These findings are frequently found in association with a bihemispheric CNS disorder. There were no
sharp waves or seizures.
