HISTORY:

81 y.o. MALE R HANDED ADMITTED FOR CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS. PMHX
DM TYPE 2



MEDICATIONS:


HEPARIN




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:





A posterior dominant rhythm that at best reached 6 Hz was present. Background activity was
characterized by diffuse theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.




During drowsiness, a more pronounced diffuse background slowing is seen.


Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1.  Moderate generalized slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to moderate diffuse background slowing
and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
