DATE OF STUDY: 09/21/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, drowsy and asleep





HISTORY:

a 44 y.o. female with a history of hepatic encephalopathy and decreased
responsiveness, referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

micafungin (MYCAMINE) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

midodrine (PROAMATINE) tablet 5 mg


octreotide (SandoSTATIN) injection 100 mcg

albumin human 25 % injection 12.5 g

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion


lactulose retention enema

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL



pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg

heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units


ceftolozane-tazobactam (ZERBAXA) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

metroNIDAZOLE (FLAGYL) IVPB 500 mg


vancomycin 50 mg/mL oral solution 125 mg

norepinephrine (LEVOPHED) 16 mg/250 mL (64 mcg/mL) in NSS infusion

ipratropium-albuterol (DUO-NEB) nebulizer solution 3 mL

albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 5 mg





SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel bedside electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The resting background demonstrates generalized low amplitude irregular 1.5-3 Hz activity, with
maximum amplitude anteriorly. Occasional semirhythmic low to medium amplitude frontally
predominant 2-3 Hz activity is seen. The patient was intermittently observed to be clenching teeth or
moving head side to side with associated muscle artifact. In response to auditory stimulation, slight
increased amplitude and frequency of irregular slow activity along with prominent muscle artifact
were noted.






No persistent focal slowing and no paroxysmal epileptiform discharges were recorded.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal bedside EEG due to:


1. Diffuse voltage attenuation



2. Generalized background slowing and disorganization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are indicative of a bihemispheric functional disturbance of cerebral activity such as
that seen with a variety of generalized encephalopathies of various etiologies. No persistent focal
slowing, no clinical or electrographic seizures and no paroxysmal epileptiform discharges were
recorded.
