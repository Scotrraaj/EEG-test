HISTORY: 44 y.o. female with a history of neurosis, first ever seizures this morning, now poorly responsive referred for routine EEG for treatment of status epilepticus.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: albuterol (PROVENTIL) 2.5 mg/0.5 mL nebulizer solution acetylcysteine (MUCOMYST) 200 mg/mL (20 %) solution ertapenem (INVanz) 1 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB phenytoin (DILANTIN) 1,200 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 4,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB- just starting during EEG acetylcysteine (MUCOMYST) 200 mg/mL (20 %) solution albuterol (PROVENTIL) 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) nebulizer solution lactulose retention enema spironolactone (ALDACTONE) tablet 100 mg haloperidol lactate (HALDOL) injection 2 mg furosemide (LASIX) injection 40 mg magnesium oxide (MAG-OX) tablet 400 mg acetylcysteine (MUCOMYST) 20 % 1 mL plus albuterol 2.5 mg/3 mL nebulizer mixture solution enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg QUEtiapine (SEROQUEL) tablet 25 mg chlorhexidine (PERIDEX) 0.12 % solution 15 mL insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 4 Units nicotine (NICODERM CQ) patch 21 mg ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg propranolol (INDERAL) tablet 10 mg  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal/tactile stimulation.  The patient is in an ICU, somnolent with a trach.  She is tachypnea, eyes open, staring to the right.  There is some head nodding. Previous left gaze deviation.  DAY 1 (8/18/2016, 14:36 - 8/20/2016, 13:42)  EEG BACKGROUND: The overall background is slow with frequency theta pattern.    There is an epileptiform focus in the right posterior quadrant with variability.  Moderate generalized slowing is present.     There is continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the midtemporal region and associated loss of faster frequencies.    EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges are seen at  T6/P4 with a field that spreads to T4.The epileptiform has variability in frequency at the onset of the record but this progressively become less frequent and are only seen rarely at the end of the record.   ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  none       EVENTS: None  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 66bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: 1. Right posterior quadrant PLEDs, resolved to rare sharp waves 2. Right temporal focal slow and attenuation 3. Moderate generalized background slowing.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal ICU stat EEG due to right posterior quadrant epileptiform discharges and focal slowing which is indicative of an area of focal cortical irritability and structural dysfunction. In addition there is moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
