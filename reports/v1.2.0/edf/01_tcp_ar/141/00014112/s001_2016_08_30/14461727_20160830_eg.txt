HISTORY:

30 y.o. MAN WITH CC CERBRAL PARENCHYMAL HEMORRHAGE, SDH, SK FX.
S/P B/L CRANIOTOMY.  EVALUATION FOR SEIZURES.

SEDATION: see above.


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system ith T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.


Central predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.

Sleep is not captured



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the F3 >F4 region with an asymmtery in
amplitude consistent with a breach.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:




1. Bifrontal (left more than right) focal slow waves , seen continuously and with an associated breach.


2. Diffuse slow waves, moderate to severe

3. Excess beta.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the bifrontal (left more than right)
region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in these regions, likely structural
in origin. In addition there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
