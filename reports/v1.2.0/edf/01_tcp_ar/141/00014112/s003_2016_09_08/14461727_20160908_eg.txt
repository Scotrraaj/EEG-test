START DATE OF STUDY: 09/08/16 at 17:40 END DATE OF STUDY: 09/10/16 at 00:48  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:  EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 30 y.o. male with a history of TBI s/p bifrontal craniotomies referred for EEG for assessment of persistent altered mental status.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: sodium chloride 3 % infusion 500 mL famotidine (PEPCID) 40 mg/5 mL (8 mg/mL) suspension 20 mg mannitol (OSMITROL) 20 % infusion 25 g senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) EC tablet 10 mg midazolam (VERSED) 50 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL infusion PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) injection 30 mg docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg sodium phosphates (FLEET) enema 1 enema magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) suppository 10 mg fentaNYL (SUBLIMAZE) 1 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion gentamicin PF 8 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL chlorhexidine (PERIDEX) 0.12 % solution 15 mL hydrogen peroxide solution 3% sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg  Facility-Administered Medications Ordered in Other Encounters: ceFAZolin (ANCEF) injection fentaNYL (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection midazolam (VERSED) 1 mg/mL injection rocuronium (ZEMURON) injection phenylephrine (NEO-SYNEPHRINE) injection levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB   SEDATION: meds as above  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (9/8/2016, 17:40 - 9/9/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The background is featureless, continuous, and consists of disorganized delta with superimposed beta. There is no clear reactivity, variability, or state change.    Delta activity is higher in amplitude over the right (F4) > left (F3) frontal regions, with superimposed beta activity.  This is likely consistent with bilateral (right > left) breach rhythms.  There is severe generalized slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 80s-100s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing, with background disorganization and lack of reactivity 2. Bifrontal (right > left) polymorphic slowing 3. Bifrontal (right > left) breach rhythms 4. Tachycardia  These findings are consistent with bifrontal (right > left) cerebral dysfunction superimposed on a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Bifrontal breach rhythms are associated with this patient's known history of craniotomies.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (9/9/2016, 06:00 - 9/10/2016, 00:48)  BACKGROUND: demonstrates variability; with periods of increased alpha and beta prevalence superimposed on delta, alternating with delta and admixed beta as on day 1  GENERALIZED SLOWING: moderate-severe  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 100s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Moderate-severe generalized slowing. Otherwise, unchanged compared with day 1. No epileptiform features. Study stops recording 9/10/2016 00:48.       -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Severe generalized slowing, with background disorganization and lack of reactivity on day 1, that improve somewhat to moderate-to-severe generalized slowing on day 2 2. Bifrontal (right > left) polymorphic slowing 3. Bifrontal (right > left) breach rhythms 4. Tachycardia   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are consistent with bifrontal (right > left) cerebral dysfunction superimposed on a diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is "severe" on day 1 and "moderate-to-severe" on day 2. Bifrontal breach rhythms are associated with this patient's known history of craniotomies.
