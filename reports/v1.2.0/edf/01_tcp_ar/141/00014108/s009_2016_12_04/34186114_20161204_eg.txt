HISTORY: 31 y.o. male with a history of seizures.    MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (Solu-MEDROL) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL XR) 12 hr tablet 300 mg   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  12/04/2016 - 12/5/2016  BACKGROUND: The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  The AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient is present.   Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Rare (<1hour) left>right anterior temporal spikes with after going slow waves are captured.  Maximal scalp negativity occurs over F7/T1 and F8/T2 leads.  These are seen only during sleep.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured heart rate of 66 bpm.     IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal nearly 21-hour long term video EEG due to: Rare left>right independent anterior temporal epileptiform discharges that are seen during sleep.  There are independent potentially epileptogenic foci over the bilateral anterior temporal regions.
