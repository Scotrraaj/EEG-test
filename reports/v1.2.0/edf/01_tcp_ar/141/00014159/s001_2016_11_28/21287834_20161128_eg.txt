SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse very low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.


At times some bifrontal beta is seen.



Sleep is not captured



Severe generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Stimulation caused some very mild muscle reactivity but no clear variability.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Wide complexed and irregular at times on
a single lead.



IMPRESSION:



1. Severe diffuse background slowing

2. Abnormal heart rate.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal comatose 1 hr EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction
the beta seen may suggest that this findings may be in part due to medication effect.
