HISTORY: 63 y.o. male with a history of HTN, HLD, CVA who had a VFib arrest and was coded for 20-45 minutes, found to have 100% LAD occlusion s/p stent, now presenting with diffuse myoclonic jerking, 3-4x/minute, referred for EEG as part of hypothermia protocol and to evaluate body jerking.  MEDICATIONS: propofol, versed  SEDATION: as above  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (3/17/2016, 13:17 - 3/18/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND, EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY, EVENTS: The record opens to a suppressed background with bursts of sharply contoured activity lasting 2-3 seconds with admixed fast frequency activity, occurring every 20-50 seconds.  There is no definite clinical correlate to the bursts.  There is no reactivity, variability, or state change.  There is severe generalized slowing.  At 14:31, the bursts organize into electrographic seizures: EEG: There is onset of 3-4 Hz generalized spike-and-wave activity that decreases in amplitude and increases in frequency to monomorphic theta activity with admixed spikes, gradually decreasing in frequency and amplitude until the interictal background resumes.  Interictally there is a suppressed background or generalized periodic discharges (GPDs, or GPEDs), at 1 Hz. CLINICAL: There is occasional sporadic isolated facial twitching.  The seizures occur nearly continuously and last 30 s to 1 min 50 sec.   Seizures resolve by 21:30.  At this time a discontinuous/burst suppression pattern re-emerges.  Bursts consist of generalized spike-wave discharges at 1 Hz x4-5 seconds, interspersed with periods of suppression lasting 4-5 seconds.  By 04:30, the pattern shifts to nearly continuous 1-1.5 Hz generalized spike-wave discharges (generalized periodic discharges, GPDs, or GPEDs).  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate of 59 bpm.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing with lack of reactivity 2. Burst suppression pattern, which evolves into generalized seizures, which resolve back into burst suppression pattern followed by generalized periodic discharges as described above  These findings are consistent with generalized seizures, which resolve by 3/17/16 21:30, superimposed on generalized hyperexcitability and severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (3/18/2016, 06:00 - 3/18/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Near continuous generalized periodic discharges at 1-1.5 Hz  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate of 78 bpm.   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION This is an abnormal video long term EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing and lack of reactivity 2. Near continuous generalized periodic discharges at 1-1.5 Hz  These findings are consistent with generalized epileptogenic discharges superimposed on severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No seizures are seen on this day.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (3/18/2016, 06:00 - 3/19/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Continuous generalized periodic discharges at 1-1.5 Hz  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change from day 2.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 4 (3/19/2016, 06:00 - 3/20/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: as versed is uptitrated, background becomes increasingly suppressed  GENERALIZED SLOWING: severe generalized sloiwng  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Continuous generalized periodic discharges at 1-1.5 Hz, decreasing in frequency to 0.5-1 Hz on this day  EVENTS: None  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 90s   DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Generalized periodic discharges persist but occur at slightly lower frequency with more suppressed background, consistent with medication effect.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 5 (3/20/2016, 06:00 - 3/21/2016, 06:00)   BACKGROUND, GENERALIZED SLOWING, EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: As Versed is uptitrated, background becomes a burst suppression pattern, with bursts consisting of diffuse sharp waves or sharply contoured theta occurring every 2-4 seconds, then every 6-10 seconds, on a suppressed background.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 90s   DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  A burst suppression pattern is achieved as Versed is uptitrated.  Bursts appear less epileptiform than on previous days.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 6 (3/21/2016, 06:00 - 3/22/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND, GENERALIZED SLOWING, EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Background remains in burst suppression, with bursts consisting of diffuse sharp waves or sharply contoured theta waves lasting 0.4-2 seconds, and suppression lasting 6-30 seconds.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured tachycardia to the 120s-130s   DAY 6 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Burst suppression pattern continues as on day 5. Tachycardia noted. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 7 (3/22/2016, 06:00 - 3/22/2016, 08:08)   BACKGROUND, GENERALIZED SLOWING, EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Background remains in burst suppression, with no change from day 6.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured tachycardia up to the 150s.   DAY 7 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Burst suppression pattern continues as on day 6. Tachycardia continues to be noted.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:  1. Severe generalized slowing with lack of reactivity 2. Burst suppression pattern, which evolves into generalized seizures on day 1, resolving back into burst suppression and then developing into generalized periodic discharges that persist until day 5 when a burst suppression pattern is again achieved as versed is uptitrated. This pattern continues until the study is discontinued on day 7. 3. Tachycardia as noted above   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of generalized seizures (resolved on day 1), with generalized epileptiform potentials superimposed on severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which, by days 5-7, is at least in part due to medication effect. Tachycardia is noted as described above.
