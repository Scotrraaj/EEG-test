DATE OF STUDY: 08/26/16 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: OR EEG TYPE: 5.5Hours   HISTORY: a 70 y.o. female her for PTE.  INDUCTION MEDS: VERSED, FENTANYL, ROCURONIUM,    MAINTINENCE MEDS:   ISOFLURANE, FENTANYL, VECURONIUM.   TECHNIQUE: A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  INCISION:  8:55AM HEPARIN: 9:19AM  25000UNITS CROSS CLAMP: COOLING:  9:26AM SUPPRESSION: 9:52AM CIRRC ARREST: 10:18A/ 10:49A 11:07A CARDIAC ARREST: WARMING:11:25AM CONTINUEOUS EEG:  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   During the procedure the EEG after induction the background becomes diffusely delta slow. Then the frequency progressively become slower with cooling later with burst suppression and lastly diffusely attenuated with some generalized periodic discharges seen, after which it is completely suppressed.  This is informed to the surgical team.  After rewarming the EEG background reveals a low amplitudeburts suppression pattern with delta bursts. This progressively becomes more continuous and faster frequencies are seen. Bitemporal left more than right focal slow waves are noted. The team is informed about this.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead during the procedure and its absence is noted during cardiac arrest.  IMPRESSION: Uneventful EEG during intraoperative monitoring.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal slowing seen at the end of the procedure may be indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction. Clinical follow up is recommended.
