HISTORY:

57 y.o. female with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

PHENYTOIN SODIUM EXTENDED (DILANTIN PO), Take  by mouth.


alprazolam (XANAX) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth 3 times

daily as needed.

METFORMIN HCL (METFORMIN PO), Take  by mouth.


HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE PO, Take  by mouth.

vitamin A & D ointment, Apply  topically as needed.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.



Diffuse excess beta activity is present.


Patient remains awake throughout the study.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


A single left frontal sharp transient waveform is present (F3

maximal)


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A regular is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only 22-minute routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication


effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.



The single sharply contoured waveform over the left frontal

region is of unclear clinical significance.
