This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.    DAY 1 (/1/12/2016, 3:30PM - 1/13/2016, 9:00)  BACKGROUND: Th patient is comatose. There is no waking background. There is diffuse and severe amplitude suppression even when recorded at 3 microvolts sensitivity.    Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.  The background is non-reactive, non-variable. A very small amount of muscle artifact is seen.  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Sleep was not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured sinus tachycardia.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: Severe amplitude attenuation, no normal cerebral activity, and no reactivity. These findings hold a grave prognosis for neurological recovery in the setting of cardiac arrest. No electrographic seizures were identified. These findings were communicated to the primary team.
