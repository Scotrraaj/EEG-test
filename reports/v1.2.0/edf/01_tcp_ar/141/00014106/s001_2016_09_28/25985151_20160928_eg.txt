HISTORY:

52 y.o. male with a history of COPD, hypertension, hepatitis C, metastatic
melanoma, new onset generalized tonic-clonic convulsion, found to have multiple right
frontoparietal brain metastases, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 20 mg

metoprolol tartrate (LOPRESSOR) tablet 25 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

oxyCODONE (ROXICODONE) immediate release tablet 5 mg


morphine injection 2 mg

ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is asymmetric, with well organized low to medium amplitude rhythmic 9-10
Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) on the left. Posterior rhythmic activity is poorly developed
over the right hemisphere. Low amplitude bilateral anterior beta activity was seen. Over the right
hemisphere, nearly continuous medium amplitude polymorphic 1-4 Hz delta activity was seen, most
prominent anteriorly, with intermixed irregular low to medium amplitude theta activity.





Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 80 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Right hemispheric polymorphic delta activity and poorly developed dominant posterior rhythmic
activity during wakefulness.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are indicative of a prominent right hemisphere functional disturbance consistent with
the known diagnosis of right frontoparietal brain metastases. No clinical or electrical seizures and no
definite pathologic paroxysmal epileptiform discharges were recorded.
