DATE OF STUDY: 09/07/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 36 y.o. female with a history of seizure on 9/6 prior to admission while inhaling crack
cocaine, with second generalized convulsion in the emergency room, referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg


enalaprilat (VASOTEC) injection 0.625 mg

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

morphine injection 2 mg




SEDATION: Lorazepam



TECHNIQUE:






A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient was variably agitated, confused and combative. The resting background consists of
generalized low voltage beta activity with intermixed muscle, movement and electrode artifact.
Occasional low and low to medium voltage 1-3 Hz activity was seen predominantly over central and
posterior scalp regions. Infrequent medium amplitude 10-12 Hz activity was seen over central and
temporal scalp areas.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG due to:


1. Diffuse low-voltage slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a bihemispheric functional disturbance such as that seen
with a variety of generalized encephalopathies of various etiologies. No clinical or electrical seizures,
no persistent focal slowing, and no pathologic paroxysmal epileptiform discharges were recorded.
