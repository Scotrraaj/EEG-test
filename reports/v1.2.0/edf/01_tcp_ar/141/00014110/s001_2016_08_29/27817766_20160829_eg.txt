SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of disorganized symmetric mixture of mainly
theta frequencies, with a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at best reaches 8 Hertz . The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Excessive 5-7 Hz activity is seen
diffusely in wakefulness.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the right fronto-temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:




There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of  72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Ocassional right frontotemporal focal slow waves



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the right
frontotemporal  region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.


In addition there is mild diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
