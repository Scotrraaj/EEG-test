HISTORY:

48 y.o. WOMAN PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P LT LUNG

ANOMALY ON ECMO. LESS RESPONSIVE, NOTED WITH EPISODE OF SHAKING


THIS PM GIVEN 2 MG OF ATIVAN EEG TO R/O SZ.


MEDICATIONS:


ATIVAN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


characterized by diffuse low voltage delta activity with absence

of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. At


times there is some central alpha can be seen.


Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSIO

1. Diffuse slowing, moderate to severe.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal routine EEG due to moderate to severe diffuse

background slowing. This finding is indicative of moderate to


severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically

nonspecific.
