TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:



Much of the record consists of sleep. Sleep is characterized by

normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS,

vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was


not captured.



During brief periods of wakefulness, the background is symmetric,

reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate

amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by


a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm

(PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  The


background quickly slows to the drowsy state from wakefulness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds, but the technician notes that the patient kept falling


asleep.  There is no clear effect of hyperventilation on

background rhythms.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps), performed mostly during periods of

drowsiness, does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION / CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an essentially normal awake and asleep routine EEG.


There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or

detected.


Note is made, however, that the patient easily fell asleep

several times throughout the exam.  If clinically indicated, a


sleep study may be of value.
