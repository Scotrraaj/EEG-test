HISTORY:

51 y.o. female with a history of seizures since childhood (last seizure 3-4 months ago)
and frontal headaches x1 yr, as well as asthma referred for routine EEG for characterization of
seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

PHENYTOIN SODIUM EXTENDED (DILANTIN PO), Take 100 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


citalopram (CELEXA) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth nightly.

DIPHENHYDRAMINE HCL (BENADRYL PO), Take 50 mg by mouth nightly.

albuterol (PROVENTIL) 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) nebulizer solution, Take 2.5 mg by nebulization
every 6 hours as needed for Wheezing.


BECLOMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE (QVAR IN), Inhale  into the lungs.


diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) 25 mg capsule, Take 25 mg by mouth daily.

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Very brief periods of drowsiness are characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation
and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm.



Sleep is not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces scant
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and briefly drowsy routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic
events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and briefly drowsy routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
