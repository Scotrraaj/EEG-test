HISTORY:

24 y.o. male with a history of autism and seizures referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS: none listed



SEDATION: None listed



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.






During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.


In drowsiness there is frequent bitemporal independent polymorphic slowing.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


There is frequent slow and rapid eye movement artifact in drowsiness. Occasionally, 3-beats of right
sided nystagmus artifact is detected.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Frequent bitemporal independent polymorphic slowing noted in drowsiness

Note frequent eye movement artifact, as described above



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of bitemporal independent dysfunction.
