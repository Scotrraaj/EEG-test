START DATE OF STUDY: 04/04/2016

END DATE OF STUDY: 04/10/2016



RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Epilepsy Monitoring Unit

EEG TYPE: Long term recording






HISTORY:

This is a 19 y.o. right handed male admitted for continuous


video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring with a history of:

paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal

events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more

of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or


clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and




morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and

determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left


untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual

mortality rate.


- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient

number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are

reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures

and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures

and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient


safety during seizures;

- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these

medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses

to document patientÂ’s exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG

monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of

monitoring.  The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG


monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were

placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20


international electrode system.  Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9,

T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.

Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances

were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was


recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored

to computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently


reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.



Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and

computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG


activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8

hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A


neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.

The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a


registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and

testing.  During times when a technician was not available, EEG


recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and

nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.



The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program

(trademark named

time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.


Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were

reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and


detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external

hard drive media.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2


times daily.


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



DAY 1 (04/4/2016,  - 4/5/2016, 06:00)


BACKGROUND:



The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized.



Posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 9 Hz

alpha activity.  The expected AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient

Is present.



The background is reactive and variable.



There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was characterized by symmetric sleep spindles and/or

K-complexes.  Slow wave sleep and REM sleep is present.



PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present


EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or


detected.



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal awake and asleep study.

DAY 2 (04/05/2016, 06:00 - 4/6/2016, 06:00)


AEDs: Keppra 250 mg BID



Sleep deprived.



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

No change.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



EKG: A single lead captured regular heart that decreases to <60

bpm during sleep.



DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Normal awake and asleep study.

-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 3 (04/06/2016, 06:00 - 4/7/2016, 06:00)


AEDs: Keppra 250 mg qam only



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:


No change


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



SEIZURES/EVENTS:


At least 2 events of chewing/ lip smacking occurred while asleep

are captured.  Examples at ~2:53:23 AM and 3:11:33 AM.  Each


lasts <10 seconds and starts during stage II sleep.  Once the

event is over, stage II sleep is again seen.  EEG is only notable

for chewing artifact.



EKG: A single lead captured regular heart rate.



DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal awake and asleep study.  Two brief (<10 sec) events of


chewing/ lip smacking that occurred out of stage II sleep had no

ictal correlate.
