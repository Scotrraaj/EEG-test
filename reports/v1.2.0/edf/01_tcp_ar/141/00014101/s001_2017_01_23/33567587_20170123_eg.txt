DATE OF STUDY: 01/23/17 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep    HISTORY: a 75 y.o. female with a history of dementia, ventriculomegaly, episode of involuntary movement of one arm referred for routine EEG  "75 y.o. female who presents with an acute episode of encephalopathy. Patient was initially thought to have a UTI but there was no improvement with a 3 day course of treatment. She was also noted to have possible right sided rhythmic movements at which point Neurology was consulted to rule out seizures. The patient has a history of prior left sided CVA with residual aphasia and right sided weakness. " MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) suppository 10 mg cyanocobalamin injection 1,000 mcg amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg dextrose 5 % and sodium chloride 0.45 % infusion senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) packet 17 g levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB famotidine (PEPCID) tablet 20 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units azithromycin (ZITHROMAX) tablet 250 mg aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg TECHNIQUE: A 22 minute bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record and included a single channel of EKG and   Verbal Stimulation. The patient has her hands on her face or in her mouth.   EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is almost completely obscured by muscle. In the few moments that the that the patient becomes quiet a theta pattern is noted.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 73 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal bedside EEG due to: 1.  A clearly slow pattern, despite significant artifact  CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the limitations described above, if it is important to define an epileptiform focus for this patient, a repeat study in the lab, allowing the patient to fall asleep is suggested.
