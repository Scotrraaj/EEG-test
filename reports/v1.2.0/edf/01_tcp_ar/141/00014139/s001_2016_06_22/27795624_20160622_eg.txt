HISTORY:

19 y.o. male with a history of TBI, TC seizure yesterday, known
Encephalomalacia/gliosis in the frontal lobes (right greater


than left) referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


traMADol (ULTRAM) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed for Pain.

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by a somewhat disorganized and nearly symmetric mixture
of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is
shifting slowing and shifting asymmetries in the PDR.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep: Vertex waves, POSTS, SPINDLE.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Rare focal slowing is present. Rare L occipital delta.  There is also one  focal delta burst in the right
frontal region (crani defect)


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse  background slowing.



Photic Stimulation:  Elicits driving bilaterally


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Disorganization and shifting slowing.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are frequently found in association with  Prior severe TBI. No epileptiform features
were seen.  Prior studies were not available at this time.
