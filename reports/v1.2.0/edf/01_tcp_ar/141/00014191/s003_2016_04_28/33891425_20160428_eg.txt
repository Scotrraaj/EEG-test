DATE OF STUDY: 04/28/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 77 y.o. female with a history of PTE, s/p staring spell today with R arm twitch referred
for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth 2 times daily.

multivitamin (MULTIPLE VITAMIN ESSENTIAL) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

lovastatin (MEVACOR) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.


losartan (COZAAR) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. Combination Losartan Potassium

hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 12.5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

Lecithin 1,200 mg Capsule, Take  by mouth.


Glucosamine-Chondroit-Vit C-Mn (GLUCOSAMINE-CHONDROITIN COMPLX) Capsule, Take  by
mouth.
Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, 1,000 unit Capsule, Take  by mouth.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.3 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  The alpha slows first



Sleep is characterized by transitions in and out of sleep.FIRDA was noted


No generalized slowing is present.  Age appropriate infrequent R or L temporal focal slowing is
present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG for an adult of this age.  There are no clinical or
electrographic events reported or detected.





CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  The patient is very sleepy.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
