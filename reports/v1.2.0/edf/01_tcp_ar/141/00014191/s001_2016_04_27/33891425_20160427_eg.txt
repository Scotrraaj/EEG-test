SEDATION: FENTANYL,VERSED,ISO,ROCURONIUM,ETOMIDATE,



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG. standard operative montage was utilized.  A 20
minute baseline preceded the operative study which was recorded in several sections.  The EEG
technologist was in communication with the EEG faculty and the surgical team throughout the
procedure




EEG BACKGROUND 20 minutes:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Operative study:


The record begins with an awake pattern with a 9 Hz, symmetric reactive alpha rhythm.  Induction of
anesthesia at 9:30 produces generalized and rhythmic slowing.  This is followed by an discontinuous
pattern.


Cooling begins at 10 AM and produces an increasingly suppressed pattern.  The patient was called
to 16 and the EEG was called as suppressed at 11:55 AM.


Rewarming began at 1:15 PM.  By 2 PM, and the EEG pattern was starting to return with a
discontinuous low-voltage pattern.  The EEG was somewhat slow to return.  The operative team was
notified.


The EEG seemed to be a little bit more vigorous when the blood pressure was a little higher.



The EEG concludes at 4:15 PM with a low voltage but continuous pattern

HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELAT ION:

EEG monitoring during therapeutic hypothermia produced a suppressed cerebral pattern with
gradual return with rewarming
