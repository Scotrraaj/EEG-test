HISTORY:

73 y.o. male with a history of right lung

transplant, complicated by peri-op code, referred for routine EEG


for assessment of mental status change. Note is made that patient

has been off sedation since 1/24 10 am.



MEDICATIONS: PHENYLEPHRINE, NOREPINEPHRINE, CYCLOSPORINE,

INSULIN, PANTOPRAZOLE, HYDROCORTISONE, CEFEPIME, DARBEPOETIN,

MIDODRINE, GANCICLOVIR, ACTIGALL URSODROL



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is continuous and symmetric but not reactive to


noxious stimulation. It consists of disorganized delta with

admixed theta, and attenuated faster frequencies.  There is no

variability or state change.



Severe generalized slowing is present.

There is no focal slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. Severe generalized slowing, with background disorganization

and lack of reactivity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe


diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

When compared with the patient's routine EEG from 1/25, the


background appears similar and triphasic waves are not seen on

the current study.
