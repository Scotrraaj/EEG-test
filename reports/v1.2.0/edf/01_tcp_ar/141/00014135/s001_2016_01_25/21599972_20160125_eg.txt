HISTORY:

a 73 YR MALE S/P RIGHT LUNG TX 1/6/16. PT WITH

DECREASING MS.  NEURO EVAL.  OFF SEDATION SINCE 1/24 10 AM.  STAY


COMPLICATED BY PERIOP CODE (NO INFO).


MEDICATIONS:


PROGRAF, DIGOXIN, HEPARIN, EPINEPHRINE, VASOPRESSIN,

NOREPINEPHRINE



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was

characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity


with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies. Diffuse, frontally maximal 0.2Hz periodic sharp

waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the

recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior


phase lag.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:

1. Triphasic waves


2. Diffuse slow, moderate to severe.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of frequent frontally-maximal

triphasic waves and severe diffuse background slowing.  These


findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which

is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic


origin.
