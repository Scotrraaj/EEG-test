START DATE OF STUDY: 04/27/16 at 16:32 END DATE OF STUDY: 04/28/16 at 12:24  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 61 y.o. male with a history of L MCA stroke (7/2015) and post-stroke epilepsy (since 12/2015) referred for EEG for evaluation and management of possible seizure exacerbation.  MEDICATIONS: Keppra 1000 mg q12h 4/27/2016: Vimpat 200 mg load, then initiation of 100 mg q12h  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (4/27/2016, 16:32 - 4/28/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric. The right hemisphere consists of a well organized mixture of alpha with frontal beta, with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz. The left hemisphere consists of a poorly organized mixture of theta and delta, with a posterior dominant rhythm that is less clearly seen.  There is no generalized slowing.  Drowsiness and sleep are characterized by further slowing of the background. Well-formed sleep transients are not seen.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Occasional (1/hour to <1min) bi-frontal spikes, always higher in amplitude over the left hemisphere, which phase reverse over the left frontal region (Fp1) in a circle montage.  EVENTS:  Staff notes patient with several shaking episodes: 18:40 - patient moves right arm and looks toward it, yawning, then relaxes. Several seconds later he scratches himself with left arm. 18:50 - patient scratching groin with left arm. He is tremulous. This scratching activity waxes and wanes. Patient does not follow commands for nurse but this appears to be his baseline (aphasia) EEG: none of the above events are associated with definitive EEG changes. Background is obscured by muscle artifact for some.  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 60s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Continuous left hemispheric slowing  2. Occasional bi-frontal spikes, which are most likely left frontal in origin with rapid bi-synchrony. 3. The episodes described above are most consistent with behavioral episodes; they have no EEG correlate.      -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (4/28/2016, 06:00 - 4/28/2016, 12:24)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:   EVENTS:  4/28/2016 at 10:17 CLINICAL: Intermittent, at times vigorous, scratching of groin with left hand/arm. This activity waxes and wanes and is distractable. Staff asks patient to name, follow commands but he is aphasic at baseline and unable to do so. EEG: background is obscured by muscle artifact at times, but no definitive EEG changes  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION Similar to day 1       -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Continuous left hemispheric slowing  2. Occasional bi-frontal spikes, which are most likely left frontal in origin with rapid bi-synchrony. 3. Episodes described above that are most consistent with behavioral episodes and not focal seizures   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of left frontal epileptogenic potentials superimposed on left hemisphere dysfunction, likely structural in etiology. Episodes captured as described above are unlikely to represent seizure; they are most consistent with behavioral changes/agitation.
