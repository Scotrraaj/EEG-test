SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower


waveforms over the left.


The background over the right consists of 8-8.5 Hz activity

posteriorly, poor AP gradient and excess polymorphic theta


activity.



The background over the left consists of fragmented attenuated

7-8 Hz theta activity posteriorly, lack of AP

(anterior-to-posterior) gradient and continuous polymorphic theta

and delta activity that is most pronounced over the anterior and


middle quadrants.



During drowsiness, the degree of diffuse theta activity

increases.



Sleep is not captured





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Several moderate-to-high amplitude prefrontal bisynchronous

spikes with aftergoing waves are captured (Fp1 and Fp2 max).

They are higher in amplitude over the left.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional

abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild diffuse slowing

2. Continuous moderate left hemispheric slowing that is most

pronounced over the anterior and middle quadrants


3. Several prefrontal bisynchronous epileptiform discharges.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral


dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.

Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural


lesion over the left.

There is epileptogenic focus over the bilateral prefrontal


region: given the clinical history of a left MCA stroke and

subtle asymmetry of epileptiform discharges (higher in amplitude

over the left), suspect that the epileptogenic focus is over the

left.
