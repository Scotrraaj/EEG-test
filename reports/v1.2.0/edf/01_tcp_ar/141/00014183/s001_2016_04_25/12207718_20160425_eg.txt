DATE OF STUDY: 04/25/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 65 y.o. MAN WO WAS AT CHURCH AND FELT VERY SLUGGISH, COULDN'T
URINATE, BLURRY VISION, NO HEADACHE, BUT BOWELS DID RELEASE.



PMHX;HTN, BPH, GERD, CKD, DEPRESSION, NO H/O SZ



MEDS;AMLODIPINE, DOXEPIN, PRAVASTATIN, FINASTERIDE, VALSARTAN


MEDICATIONS:


AMLODIPINE, DOXEPIN, PRAVASTATIN, FINASTERIDE, VALSARTAN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to movement artifact and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. Excessive
diffuse theta in wakefulness is seen.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Mild diffuse slow


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy limited routine EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing.
This finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
