START DATE OF STUDY: 03/20/2016 at 17:29 END DATE OF STUDY: 03/21/2016 at 11:08  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:  EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 48 y.o. female with no past medical history who was reported to have a convulsion and arrived to ER comatose, requiring intubation, referred for EEG for treatment of status epilepticus and assessment of mental status change.  MEDICATIONS: received 2 mg Versed before study (for MRI)  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (3/20/2016, 17:29 - 3/21/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of alpha with admixed beta. There is occasional mild excess of theta frequencies in wakefulness. There is a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz.  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured. Brief intrusions of sleep transients are noted during periods of wakefulness.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 90s.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Mild excess of theta in wakefulness 2. Brief intrusions of sleep transients during periods of wakefulness  These findings are consistent with a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Reading attending:     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (3/21/2016, 06:00 - 3/21/2016, 09:29)  BACKGROUND:  Waking background appears normal; there is no longer excess theta noted.  More defined periods of sleep and wakefulness are noted on this day.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: None  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 80's-90's.   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Normal sleep and wake study on this day.  Reading attending:      -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  1. Mild excess of theta in wakefulness, which resolves by day 2 2. Brief intrusions of sleep transients during periods of wakefulness, which resolves by day 2   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are consistent with a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction that improves by day 2.
