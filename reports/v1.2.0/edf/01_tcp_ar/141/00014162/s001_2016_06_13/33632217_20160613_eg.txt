HISTORY:

56 y.o. WOMAN S/P CODES 5/30 APPROX 20 MIN,  6/7  APPROX TOTAL 1
HR.  ALL SEDATION OFF SINCE SATURDAY 6/11.  PMHX: FAILED KIDNEY TX, EVAL FOR HEART
TX.  PT CHANGED FROM ECMO TO LVAD/RVAD  ON CONTINUEOUS HD




MEDICATIONS:

none



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:





No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse very low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.


Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the
recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag and are present at 1Hz.




Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate could not be assessed due to LVAD on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


1. Triphasic waves

2. Severe generalized slow waves and attenuation.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal coma EEG due to continuous frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which
is etiologically nonspecific, but can be seen in the setting of hypoxic injury. No seizures or
epileptiform activity was seen.
