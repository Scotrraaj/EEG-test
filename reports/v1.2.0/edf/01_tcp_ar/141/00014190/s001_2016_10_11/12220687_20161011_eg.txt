SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record
(ordered as a 1 hour study but had to be terminated at 29 minutes as patient could not tolerate the
study, with frequent movement and glossokinetic artifact). The study included a single channel of
EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric and reactive and consists of a fairly organized symmetric
mixture of alpha, theta, and delta frequencies. Occasionally a 7-8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is
seen.


During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and further
background slowing are seen.



Sleep transients are not captured.



Moderate generalized slowing is present.




Occasional shifting bitemporal polymorphic slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Occasional shifting bitemporal polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of bitemporal dysfunction superimposed on a
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
