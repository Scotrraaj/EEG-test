HISTORY:

59 y.o. male with a history of seizures and

a gunshot wound to the spine, presenting with difficulty


ambulating, right sided numbness/weakness, and right facial

twitching, referred for routine EEG for evaluation.



MEDICATIONS: HOME MEDS: COGENTIN, HALDOL, DILANTIN, ENALAPRIL,

PAXIL, HCTZ



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The majority of the study consists of drowsiness and sleep.

During brief periods of wakefulness, fragments of an irregular


posterior dominant rhythm approaching 10 Hz are seen in an

anterior to posterior gradient that is present but suboptimal.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow

wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.


Occasional sharply contoured focal theta slowing is present over

the left temporal region.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm, occasionally irregular, is captured on a


single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Suboptimal organization

2. Occasional sharply contoured focal theta slowing present over


the left temporal region.

Note is made of an occasionally irregular heart beat on a single

EKG lead.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are nonspecific indicators of left temporal

dysfunction superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction,

the latter of which may at least in part be associated with a

suboptimally awake state.


Note is made of an occasionally irregular heart beat on a single

EKG lead.
