HISTORY:

46 y.o. male The patient has severe intellectual disability, autism, chronic
otitis media, hypertension, and long-standing epilepsy. Until recently, he has been followed in the
neurology department at Einstein Hospital. He had been on treatment with Dilantinr EEG for
characterization of seizures.

TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



Drowsiness was not captured, the patient was very tense.


Sleep is not captured

No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. If possible, a sleep
deprived EEG or one hour EEG that captures sleep can be attempted
