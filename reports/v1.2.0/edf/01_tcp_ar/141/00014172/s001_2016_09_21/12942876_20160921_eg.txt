HISTORY:
64 y.o. female with a history of hypertension, arrhythmia, and episode of loss of
awareness while driving, referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.

MEDICATIONS:
No current outpatient prescriptions on file.
No current facility-administered medications for this visit.

SEDATION: None

TECHNIQUE:
A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.

EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background reveals symmetric and reactive 20-25 uV 10-12 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.

During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.

Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
positive occipital sharp transients of sleep (POSTS), and increased irregular generalized slowing.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.

Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.

EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

HEART RATE:
EKG monitor reveals sinus arrhythmia at 48-60 bpm.

IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
