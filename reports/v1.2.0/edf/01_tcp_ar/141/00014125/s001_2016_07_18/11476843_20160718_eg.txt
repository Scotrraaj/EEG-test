HISTORY:

39 YR OLD MALE R HANDED PT STATES HE HAD A FRONTAL TUMOR
REMOVED IN 2010 AT WHICH TIME HE BEGAN HAVING SZ. LAST SZ APRIL 30 TH .



MEDICATIONS:


KEPPRA


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limite record due
to F4 artifact seen after the first minutes of the study which impedes the correct evaluation of the
region and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present at F4 region during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness. There is an associated increased amplitude and faster frequencies over this region,
consistent with a breach rhythm.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1.  Continuous focal slowing in the right frontal region and associated breach.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:






This is an abnormal awake and asleep limited routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the
right frontal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely
structural in origin.
