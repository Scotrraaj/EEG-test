HISTORY:

Ella Balmer is a 58 y.o. female with a history of COPD, trach,ENT


neoplasm, s/p code today referred for LTM  EEG for screening

for subclinical seizures and monitoring during hypothermia.

current facility-administered medications for this visit:


Vecuronium



SEDATION: 5 mcg Propofol


TECHNIQUE:

Continuous portable digital video 21 channel


electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International

10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system.


This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single

channel of EKG, tactile and verbal Stimulation. T 34.2 to 34

degrees.



EEG BACKGROUND:

As the record begins, the background is low voltage, nearly


suppressed with intially two

6-8 second bursts of low voltage mixed alpha and then theta


frequency activity. No clinical features were noted with these

Bursts.


As the cooling continues, the EEG is suppressed, then often

obscured by muscle artifact.


By the end of the recording on the the video demonstrates

occasional oral and ocular movements, without EEG correlate.


The target cooling was not recorded.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

See above.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile stimulation did not alter the


record


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66- 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal bedside portable EEG due to:

1. Near suppression of cerebral activity initially with


hypothermia.

2. Low voltage pattern with little or any cerebral activity and

generous muscle artifact noted on 02/23/2016



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings must be evaluated in the context of an acute CNS


insult, the use of pharmacologic sedation and hypothermia. Final

temperature was not recorded, but the patient had some cranial


nerve function on the 23rd and the EEG was discontinued at that

time.
