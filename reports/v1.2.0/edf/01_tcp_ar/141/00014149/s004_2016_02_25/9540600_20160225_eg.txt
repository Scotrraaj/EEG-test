HISTORY:

58 y.o. female with a history of COPD, trach,ENT

neoplasm, s/p code 02/22/2016 referred for routine EEG for


persistent coma. Patient still has weak brain stem signs but CT

today demonstrated loss of gray-white differentiation and diffuse

cerebral edema with


complete bilateral sulcal effacement, effacement of the basal

cisterns

and narrowing of the fourth ventricle.


MEDICATIONS:

current facility-administered medications for this visit:

BP medicines only


SEDATION: none


TECHNIQUE:


A  bedside portable digital video 21 channel




electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International

10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system.


This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single

channel of EKG, tactile and verbal Stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is low voltage, nearly suppressed with diffuse

muscle artifact and some slow ICU artifacts, particularly at Cz.

No reactivity to tactile stimulation could be discerned.


No focal features are present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


none



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile stimulation did not alter the

record


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 92 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal bedside portable EEG due to:


1. Low voltage pattern, somewhat obscured by muscle artifact.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings support a significant cortical insult.  This is a


low voltage pattern, hence, to more completely assess the scant

cerebral activity, consider repeat study with neuromuscular


blockage.

No seizures or epileptiform features were seen.
