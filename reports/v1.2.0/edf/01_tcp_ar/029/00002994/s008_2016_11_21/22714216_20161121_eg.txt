SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background reveals a right hemisphere with nice mixture of alpha and beta frequencies
and the normal anterior-to-posterior gradient in addition to a reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR) .



The left hemisphere reveal continuous focal slow waves and maximal in the frontal region and
attenuation of faster frequencies.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by sleep transients, with asymmetric vertex waves and sleep spindles bests
seen on the right hemisphere. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None





OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Continuous left hemisphere focal slow waves maximal in the frontal region and associated
attenuation



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to continuous left hemisphere focal slow and
attenuation, which is consistent with a cortical lesson in that region.

No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
