SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists mostly

of low voltage fast frequencies. In relaxed wakefulness a

symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR)

is seen, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening, with


good organization.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical

or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.

If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
