DATE OF STUDY: 09/15/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 29 y.o. female with a history of IVDA, TBI and epilepsy in the past, found down
with ICH referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (Solu-MEDROL) 250 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL
IVPB
enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) capsule 300 mg


[START ON 9/22/2016] clonazePAM (KLONOPIN) tablet 1 mg

valproate (DEPACON) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

niMODipine (NIMOTOP) capsule 30 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL



HYDROmorphone (DILAUDID) injection 0.5 mg

ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg


diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) capsule 25 mg

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) solution 500 mg


oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet 2 tablet- patient required pre-
treatment with Percocet for the EEG

Had LTG as well.


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.  Patient was reluctant to cooperate with the test.


MRI demonstrated:  Acute to subacute hemorrhage in the right parasagittal frontal lobe


and right basal ganglia with associated mass effect as above.. Encephalomalacia/gliosis in the left
anterior temporal and left frontal lobes with chronic blood products likely related to remote trauma.
Small focus of chronic hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is actively abnormal and asymmetric.  It is characterized in asymmetry.  The
left hemisphere is slightly disorganized but with the posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz 30 uV.  There
is excess theta, intermittent arrhythmic delta activity and greater variability than anticipated in
wakefulness on the left.  The right hemisphere is characterized by significant disruption of the
posterior dominant rhythm, disruption of faster frequency activity and bursts of relatively rhythmic 1-3
Hz delta activity maximum in the frontal regions, sometimes occurring in bursts lasting 3-5 seconds



Generalized slowing is present.


Focal slowing is present.

Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmic frontal delta bilaterally

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No definite spikes


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


FIRDA.


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: none


EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 121 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:




This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Marked slowing on the right with bursts of frontal delta


2. Bilateral slowing and disorganization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:


The bursts of prominent, paroxysmal frontal delta are in the region of this patient's hemorrhage.
Because of the prominent paroxysmal quality, additional monitoring may be of value.

This EEG supports a structural abnormality in the right hemisphere, superimposed upon a
bihemispheric process, congruent with the findings outlined by imaging.  No seizures were recorded.
The issue of long-term monitoring was discussed with the ICU team.
