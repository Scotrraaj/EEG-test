CVA/syncope referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental


status change.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

limited auditory stimulation.  The patient seems drowsy and


confused. He is asleep for most of the EEG


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 6.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).


The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


Slowing, then fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and

diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep includes Vertex waves


Mild generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.






EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. Mildly slow alpha and mild background slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are suggestive of a bihemispheric process. There

were were no epileptiform features.  The patient appears very


drowsy and had limited stimulation.
