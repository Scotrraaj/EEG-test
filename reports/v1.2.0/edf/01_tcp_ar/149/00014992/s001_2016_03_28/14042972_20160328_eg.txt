HISTORY:

 57 y.o. MALE PRESENTED WITH ACUTE ONSET OF R

SIDED WEAKNESS INVOLVING HIS R SIDE OF HIS FACE R ARM . WAS FINE


LAST NIGHT AT 10 :00 AM PMHX.HTN,DM TYPE2, EOTH ABUSE,


MEDICATIONS:


INSULIN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

unsatisfactory record due continuous muscle/moevement artifact


and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The limited waking background is characterized by an absence of a

posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity

with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A hear t rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an very limited abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This EEG is limited by continuous movement artifact and definite


conclusions can me made. If there is clinical concern a repeat

study with sedation may be beneficial. The limited studied


demonstrated diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of


moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
