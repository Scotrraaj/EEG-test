SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The background consists of moderate amplitude polymorphic 7-7.5 Hz theta activity with poor AP
(anterior-to-posterior) gradient.  There is diffuse excess theta and beta activity.




Patient remains awake throughout the study.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm (appears paced) is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild diffuse slowing and disorganization.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
