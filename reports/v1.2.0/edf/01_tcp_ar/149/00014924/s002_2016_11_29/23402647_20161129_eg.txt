HISTORY:

33 y.o. female with a history of suspected focal seizures, increasing in
frequency, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

BUSPIRONE HCL (BUSPAR PO), Take  by mouth.

lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


SERTRALINE HCL (ZOLOFT PO), Take  by mouth.

ZOLPIDEM TARTRATE (AMBIEN PO), Take  by mouth.

ALPRAZOLAM (XANAX PO), Take 1 mg by mouth 2 times daily.


cyproheptadine (PERIACTIN) 4 mg tablet, Take 4 mg by mouth 3 times daily as needed.

phenytoin (DILANTIN KAPSEAL) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 3 capsules by mouth at bedtime.

LORazepam (ATIVAN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet ~30-60 minutes prior to the scan. May take another
tablet right before the scan.






SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was overall a technically
satisfactory record; however there was occasional slow wave activity noted in the T6 electrode most
consistent with artifact, limiting interpretation over this region. The study included a single channel
of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.




HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected. Please note that interpretation over the right posterior temporal region may be
limited by artifact.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
