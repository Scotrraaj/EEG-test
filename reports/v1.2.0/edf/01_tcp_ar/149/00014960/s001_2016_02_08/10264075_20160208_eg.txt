HISTORY:

51 y.o. male PT ADMITTED WITH ALTERED MENTAL

STATUS. PMHX HIV,PNEUMONIA,HEPATIC FAILURE 56 CM HEAD



MEDICATIONS:

BENZTROPINE, AZITHROMYCIN, ALBUMIN, LEVOFLOXACIN, LACTULOSE,


DICYCLOMINE.





SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due to T3


artifact , C3-P3 electrode misplacement and included a single




channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is poorly organized mixture of theta and


delta frequencies, with a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at

best reached 7Hz. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient is

absent.



Sleep is not captured




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



1. Mild to moderate diffuse slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal limited routine EEG due to mild to moderate

diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm. These findings


are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate

diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
