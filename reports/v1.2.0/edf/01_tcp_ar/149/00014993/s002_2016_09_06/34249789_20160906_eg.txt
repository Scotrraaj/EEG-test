DATE OF STUDY: 09/06/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 48 y.o. male with a history of asthma and coughing spells provoked by dust, with
associated blank stare, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

pseudoephedrine (SUDAFED) 30 mg tablet, Take 30 mg by mouth every 4 hours as needed for
Congestion.


levocetirizine (XYZAL) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth every evening.

montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth nightly.


lidocaine (XYLOCAINE) 2 % jelly, Apply  topically as needed.

predniSONE (DELTASONE) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.

sertraline (ZOLOFT) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth daily.


triamcinolone (KENALOG) 0.1 % cream, Apply 1 Application topically 2 times daily.

fluticasone-sod chl-sod bicarb 50 mcg- 0.9 % kit,spray suspension and spray, Inhale  into the nose.

ALBUTEROL SULFATE (PROAIR HFA IN), Inhale  into the lungs.




BUDESONIDE/FORMOTEROL FUMARATE (SYMBICORT IN), Inhale  into the lungs.

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily.


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 600 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 6 hours as needed for Pain.


azithromycin (ZITHROMAX) 250 mg tablet, Take 250 mg by mouth daily.


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.






Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.


This is the second normal EEG for this patient.
