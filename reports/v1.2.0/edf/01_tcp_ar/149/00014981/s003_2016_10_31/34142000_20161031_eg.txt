SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha, beta, and theta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5-9 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but
suboptimal.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous vertex waves, sleep spindles and
K-complexes. Occasionally spindles are more pronounced over the left hemisphere. Slow wave sleep
was not captured.



Mild-moderate generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.






EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Mild-moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Occasional prominence of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere, which may represent breach
rhythm in this patient with history of left craniotomy



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of mild-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.


A left hemispheric breach rhythm is consistent with this patient's known prior history of craniotomy.
