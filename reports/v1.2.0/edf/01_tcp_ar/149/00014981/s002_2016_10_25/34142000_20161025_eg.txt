HISTORY:

59 y.o. female with a history of subdural hematoma earlier this month, significant
intracranial hemorrhage with mass effect and edema, persistently impaired mental status referred for
routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


thiamine (B-1) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

multivitamin liquid 5 mL

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 1 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

valproate (DEPACON) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) suppository 10 mg

SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.  The
patient was restless and tachypneic.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a  poorly organized symmetric mixture of
theta and beta frequencies, with an asymmetric and reactive 6-9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Of note, the
posterior dominant rhythm is better represented on the left than the right.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, and an increase in background slowing were noted.
In addition, there is an increase in beta and  intermittent, brief generalized attenuation lasting 1-2
seconds




Sleep is not otherwise sustained


Moderate generalized slowing is present.


Small amount of shifting focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile stimulation elicits an alerting response


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  ICU EEG due to:


1.  Generalized background slowing

2. Shifting slowing

3. Shifting asymmetries with alpha more disrupted on the right.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

No epileptiform features were identified.  In contrast to previous EEG, this EEG is more of a pattern
of generalized slowing rather than left focal slowing.  These findings may be correlated with the
overall clinical picture
