now with change in mental status.

SEDATION: ativan



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.



With stimulation, the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta, alpha and beta activity
with frequent diffuse sleep-spindle-like waveforms.  During periods of quiescence, intermittent periods
of background discontinuity are observed.



There is subtle intermittent paucity of faster frequencies over the left frontotemporal region.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate diffuse slowing

2. Subtle intermittent left frontotemporal focal slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



Diffuse slowing finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific, but in this patient, is at least partially related to the medication effect.


Focal slowing is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but
possibly structural in origin.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
