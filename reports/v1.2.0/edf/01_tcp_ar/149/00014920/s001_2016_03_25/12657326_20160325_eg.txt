HISTORY:

21 y.o. MALE NAIL PATELLA SYNDROME. PT HAS HAD SZ

SINCE CHILDHOOD. PT P/W SZ. EEG TO RULE OUT SUBCLINICAL STATUS.


PT IS DEAF / MUTE


MEDICATIONS:


DEPAKENE, ACYCLOVIR, VANCOMYCIN, PANTOPRAZOLE, NYSTATIN,

THERAGRAN, HEPARIN



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the

bilateral anterior temporal (left more than right) regions during

wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal

(left more than right) regions.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to intermittent

focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal (left more than


right) regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral

dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
