History:	25 year old male who presents with generalized convulsions.
Medications:	Risperdal, Celexa
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Patient is asleep throughout the majority of the recording.  With stimulation, during very brief 
arousals, the background consists of 9.5 moderate amplitude alpha activity with poor AP gradient.  
Symmetrical sleep spindles, vertex waves and K-complexes are seen.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
	Disorganization, mild
	No epileptiform discharges
	Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL mostly asleep and very briefly awake EEG due to mild background 
disorganization that is seen during brief arousals. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral 
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but in this patient at least partially related to the 
excessive drowsiness.
