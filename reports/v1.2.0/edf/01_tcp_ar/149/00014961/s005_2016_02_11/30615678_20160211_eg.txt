HISTORY:

This is a 26 y.o. right handed male admitted for continuous


video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring with a history of:

paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.




Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more

of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or


clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and

morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and

determining best treatment options.  If seizures are left


untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual




mortality rate.

- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient


number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are

reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures


and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus;

- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures

and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient

safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these

medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses


to document patients exam

(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG

monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of


monitoring.  The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG

monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were

placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20

international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not


used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be

below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex


reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive.  Periods

of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of

interest and reviewed in detail.




Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and

computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG


activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 24

hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A

neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day.

The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a


registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and

testing.



The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program


(trademark named

time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.


Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.  Detections were

reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events, as well


as selected samples, were stored.


MEDICATIONS:

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 300 mg ER capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth


every evening.



SEDATION: None


DAY 1 (02/10/2016 - 2/11/2016, 08:00)



BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized.


With a posterior dominant rhythm of 10Hz.


Sleep was characterized by symmetric sleep spindles and/or

K-complexes.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

the patient has 2 clinical episodes.

At 08:04PM while in bed he shakes his body minimally side to side

for ~2 minutes but he is not tested. There is no correlate on


EEG.

At 08:11PM While in bed the patient has intermittent episodes


where he clenches his jaw and appears to become stiff for 10-20

seconds. He appears to follow commands soon after the events.


This behavior lasts for about 5 minutes. There is no EEG

correlate to the behavior.





DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal EEG awake and asleep. Two events with no EEG correlate.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 2 (02/11/2016, 08:00 - 2/12/2016, 08:00)



BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric,

well-organized. With a posterior dominant rhythm of 10Hz.



Sleep was characterized by symmetric sleep spindles and/or

K-complexes.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS: At 10:38PM the patient pushes the button and complained


of right arm stiffening.


EKG: A single EKG lead captured 84bpm.



DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

Normal EEG awake and asleep. one events with no EEG correlate.



-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 3 (02/12/2016, 08:00AM - 2/12/2016, 07:44PM)



BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric,

well-organized. With a posterior dominant rhythm of 10Hz.



Sleep was characterized by symmetric sleep spindles and/or

K-complexes.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present.




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.


EVENTS: None



EKG: A single EKG lead captured 84bpm.



DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

Normal EEG awake and asleep. one events with no EEG correlate.


-----------------------------------------------------------------


FINAL IMPRESSION:



INDUCTION PROCEDURES:

1. None



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:


Interictal Findings:  None




Ictal Findings:


The patient had 3 clinical events while hooked up to continuous

video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy monitoring unit with no EEG

correlate



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Psychogenic non-epileptic events.



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. None



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 2.5


days with continuous video EEG.   The patient was weaned off

Dilantin on the day of admission.The patient typical events were

captured with no EEG correlate.



The Psychiatry department was consulted during this

hospitalization. After the consultation the patient became


agitated and decided to leave. He was discharged on Depakote for

mood purposes. No other medication changes were made during the

hospitalization.



We recommend that he continues to see a psychiatrist or therapist

for assessment of underlying psychopathology and diagnosis.
