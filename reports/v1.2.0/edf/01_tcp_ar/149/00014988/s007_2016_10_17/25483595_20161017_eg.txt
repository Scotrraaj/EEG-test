SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized mixture of theta/delta
frequencies, with a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) that at best reaches 6-7hz.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



1. Intermittent focal slowing in the left frontal region.

2. Mild to moderate diffuse slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the left
frontal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific.

In addition there is mild to moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
