HISTORY:

59 y.o. female with a history of 20 minute

cardiac ARREST- FALL- CPR BY BYSTANDER prolonged CPR,


retroperitoneal hematoma  "HAD SZ" , DOWN TIME APPROX 20 MIN on

Feb 10, 2016. Now with myoclonic jerrks referred for routine EEG

for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

Phenytoin.



SEDATION: versed drip



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 systemwith T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and




included a single channel of EKG. The patient was intubated,

comatose with intermittent jerks.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is  Markedly abnormal. There are no normal

cerebral waveforms. The overall background is markedly suppressed

with 0.5 Hz ventilator artifact, associated with movement of the

patient's chest. Additionally, there is a burst suppression


pattern with 1-2.5 second bursts of high  (> 400 mV) 4-6 Hz

bursts without evolution.




No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

See above only.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: None

EVENTS:


Brief whole body clinical jerks are seen with the discharges

above


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 120-140 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:This is a markedly abnormal EEG for a patient who has

suffered and acute anoxic insult.

1. Burst suppression pattern.

2. Invariant backgroud.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings must be correlated with other neurological

features but carry a worrisome prognosis. These findings were


reported to the team.
