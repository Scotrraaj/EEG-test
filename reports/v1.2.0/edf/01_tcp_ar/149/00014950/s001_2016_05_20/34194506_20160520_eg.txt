HISTORY:

2 days female, born at term,  with a history of seizure two days
after birth referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Phenobarbital, Ampicillin


SEDATION:none


TECHNIQUE:


1 hour Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International
10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The background is appropriately organized for an infant of this age.  Although there is a great deal of
muscle artifact, there is a vigorous, symmetric pattern.


Sleep includes an increase in delta as well as some beta

No generalized slowing is present.



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

C4 sharps



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY

There is intermittent burst of high amplitude generalized theta

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


EVENTS:

There areno clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 157 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep  1hour EEG due to:


1.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings to be correlated with history and clinical exam.


The bursts of theta are similar to those that have historically been described in benign idiopathic
neonatal convulsions.


If there is any question, the EEG can be repeated in regard to the right central sharp waves.
