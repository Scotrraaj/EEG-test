HISTORY:

73 YR OLD MALE ADMIIED FOR HYPOTHERMIA. HAD THREE
WITNESSED SZ.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


morphine injection 1 mg

senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet

docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg


enalapril (VASOTEC) tablet 10 mg

dextrose 50% injection 50 mL


glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by very low voltage
almost completely attenuated delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies. Some small amplitude diffuse central beta is seen at times.





Sleep is not captured


Severe generalized slowing and attenuation is present.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is some muscle artifact in the background activity with auditory
and tactile stimuli.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 66bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Severe generalized slowing and attenuation



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
