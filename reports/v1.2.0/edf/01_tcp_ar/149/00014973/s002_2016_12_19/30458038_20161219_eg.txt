HISTORY: 73 y.o. male with a history of hypothermia, FTT, colon cancer? multisystem injury, hospitalized for 10 days but today 3 CPS with head and eye deviation, then unconscious. Subsequently intubated, transfer to MRICU referred for EEG for screening for subclinical seizures. 

MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB morphine injection 1 mg senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg enalapril (VASOTEC) tablet 10 mg dronabinol (MARINOL) capsule 5 mg multivitamin (THERA) tablet 1 tablet thiamine tablet 100 mg folic acid (FOLVITE) tablet 1 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg nystatin (MYCOSTATIN) 100,000 unit/mL suspension 500,000 Units   SEDATION: Ativan, then Propofol drip  TECHNIQUE: A bedside portable continuous 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.   DAY 1 ( - 12/19/2016, 13:00- 12/20/1 13:00) BP (!) 135/109 Pulse 94 Temp 97.5 F (36.4 C) Resp 18 Ht 1.7 m (5' 6.93") Wt 42.3 kg (93 lb 3.2 oz) SpO2 100% BMI 14.63 kg/m2  

BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, initially very suppressed and consists predominantly of muscle with admixed theta, lesser beta, overall featureless. . Posterior dominant rhythm was not present. The background is reactive, Variable. Later on, stimulation produces  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. Sleep was not defined  
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Despite artifacts, there are broadly contoured R mid temporal sharp waves seen with sections of the records demonstrating 0.5 Hz periodic complexes over 5-10 seconds without clinical change or evolution of the sharp waves  

EVENTS: None  EKG: A single lead captured HR 70 BPM  DAY 1

IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Markedly slow background, improving over time. Periodic sharp waves noted infrequently, not seen in later in the record.  This tracing supports both a diffuse disorder of cerebral function and a focal mechanism for seizures.
