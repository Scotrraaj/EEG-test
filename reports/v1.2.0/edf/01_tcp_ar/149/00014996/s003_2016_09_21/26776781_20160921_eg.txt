HISTORY: 53 y.o. FEMALE WTIH CC OF HEADACHE/ THEN SEIZURE.  FOUND TO HAVE RIGHT PARIETAL ICH WITH CHANGE IN MS.  PT ALSO WITH H/O SUBSTANCE ABUSE FOLLOW UP, R/O SZ  MEDICATIONS:  Current Facility-Administered Medications: LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg valproate (DEPACON) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB gentamicin PF 8 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) injection 7.5 mg fentaNYL (SUBLIMAZE) 1 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 30 mg acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg morphine injection 2 mg ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL alum-mag hydroxide-simeth (MYLANTA;MAALOX) 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension 30 mL pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg multivitamin (THERAPEUTIC-M) 9 mg iron-400 mcg per tablet 1 tablet labetalol (NORMODYNE,TRANDATE) injection 20 mg hydrALAZINE (APRESOLINE) injection 10 mg   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (9/21/2016, 13:14 - 9/22/2016, 09:58AM)  BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse very low voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Sleep is not captured  Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right fronto-central region with and increased amplitude and faster frequencies consistent with a breach.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Frequent right fronto-central sharp waves and polyspikes.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are is reported left facial twitching and left myogenic artifact but no definitive EEG correlate.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  DAY 1:  IMPRESSION: 1. Frequent sharp waves in the right fronto-central region.   2. Continuous focal slowing in the right fronto-central region and breach. 3. Moderate to severe diffuse slow.  DAY 1: CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing and frequent sharp waves in the right fronto-central region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal structural cerebral dysfunction and irritability in this region. In addition there is moderate to severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
