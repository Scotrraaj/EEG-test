SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with some central alpha but
mainly an absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. A posterior dominant
rhythm was seen only on the left infrequently and at best reached 8Hz.



Sleep is not captured



Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right fronto central region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) are seen with a polyspike and overlying fast
morphology or lateralized periodic discharges (LPD+F) best seen at F4/C4 at 0.4 to 0.5 Hz



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS/SEIZURES:



At 2:26PM the PLEDs seem to increase in frequency from 0.4 to 1 Hz and a beta frequency burst is
seen at C4 lasting for 45 seconds. However , the technician adjusts the C4 lead during the seizure
and the ending is not recorded.


No clinical correlate is seen on video.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Single right central subclinical seizure


2. LPD+F at 0.4 to 0.5 Hz

3. Moderate generalized slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal coma routine EEG due to a single right central subclinical seizure and
lateralized periodic discharges as well as continuous focal slowing.  This finding is indicative of
severe focal structural cortical cerebral dysfunction and irritability in this region. In addition there is
diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. The patient will be placed on long term
monitoring.
