HISTORY:

53 YR FEMALE WTIH CC OF HEADACHE/ THEN SEIZURE.  FOUND TO
HAVE RIGHT PARIETAL ICH WITH CHANGE IN MS.  PT ALSO WITH H/O SUBSTANCE ABUSE



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) injection 7.5 mg

valproate (DEPACON) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse
theta/dela with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.



At times with stimulation frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) is seen.



Sleep is not captured



Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.


Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present with loss of faster frequencies in the right
hemisphere maximal in the fronto temporal region.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

1.  Continuous focal slowing in the  right hemisphere maximal in the fronto temporal region


2.  Moderate diffuse background slowing and FIRDA



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep routine EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the right
hemisphere maximal in the fronto temporal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cortical
dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin. In addition there is diffuse background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
