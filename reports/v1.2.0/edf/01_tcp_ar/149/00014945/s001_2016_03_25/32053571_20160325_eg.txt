HISTORY:

22 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF FAINTING. MOST RECENT

EVENT THIS MONTH PT FELT EXTREMELY TIRED. SLUMPED IN CHAIR WOKE


UP BUT COULD NOT RESPOND.  THIS EVENT DIFFERENT FROM THE REST.

BEFORE ROOM SPIN/ LIGHTHEADED/ TUNNEL VISION/ THEN LOC.



MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and




photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically


with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left

midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during


drowsiness.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 36-40's bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Left mid-temporal focal slow.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to

intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region.  This


finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is

etiologically non-specific. There are no clinical or

electrographic events reported or detected.

Please note the bradycardia seen on single lead EKG.
