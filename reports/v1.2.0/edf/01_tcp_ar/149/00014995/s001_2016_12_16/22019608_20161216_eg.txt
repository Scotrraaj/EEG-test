HISTORY: 67 y.o with history of paranoid schizophrenia, hyperlipidemia, and memory loss here for routine EEG for syncope  MEDICATIONS: Current Outpatient Prescriptions: haloperidol (HALDOL) 2 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly for 30 days. Indications: SCHIZOPHRENIA  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Alpha rhythm is 8.7 Hz while patient is awake.   During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Transition from sleep to wakefulness is characterized by a slowed alpha rhythm of 8.3  No generalized slowing is present.  Occasional L>R temporal slowing is present which is within the range of normal for an adult of this age.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.       Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.       Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.   EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a normal awake and asleep routine  EEG for an adult of this age. A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
