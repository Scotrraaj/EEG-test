DATE OF STUDY: 05/11/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep



HISTORY:

a 71 y.o. male with a history of heart failure, requiring LVAD, now with altered
mental status.



MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

During maximal arousal the background consists of polymorphic 7-8 Hz theta posteriorly, poor AP
(anterior-to-posterior) gradient and excess diffuse polymorphic theta>delta activity.





During periods of quiescence, the background changes to diffuse delta>theta activity.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild-to-moderate diffuse background slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding is indicative of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.
