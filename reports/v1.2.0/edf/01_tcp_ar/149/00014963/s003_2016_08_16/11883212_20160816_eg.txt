SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
theta, alpha, and beta frequencies, with an irregular but symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is
present but suboptimal.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




Mild to moderate generalized slowing is present.

There is occasional bitemporal synchronous (left > right) quasirhythmic slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:




None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm with PVCs is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an 1-hour awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Occasional bitemporal synchronous (left > right) quasirhythmic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are nonspecific indicators of the presence of bitemporal (left > right) cerebral
dysfunction superimposed on a mild-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
