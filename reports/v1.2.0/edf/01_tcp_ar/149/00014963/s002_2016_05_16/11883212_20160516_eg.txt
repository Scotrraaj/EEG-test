DATE OF STUDY: 05/16/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep



HISTORY:

a 71 y.o. MAN PRESENTS FROM OSH FOR SYNCOPAL EVENTS, EG TO RULE
OUT SZ. PT HAS LVAD,  FOLLOW UP EEG.



MEDICATIONS:

VIMPAT, HYDRALAZINE, AMIODARONE, ASA, PROTONIX, COUMADIN, ZOCOR, SYNTRHOID



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The limited waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric
mixture of theta and delta frequencies, with at best a 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). An
anterior-to-posterior gradient with some faster central frequencies is infrequenly seen.






During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




The EEG is mainly in sleep and it is characterized by some poorly formed sleep transients, with
vertex waves, sleep spindles and marked diffuse delta.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Generalized slow waves, mild to moderate



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse background
slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
