HISTORY: 59 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O ASCENDING AORTIC ANEURYSM, AORTIC VALUE REPLACEMENT.  MEDICATIONS: INDUCTION MEDS: MIDAZOLAM, FENTANYL, ETOMADATE, SUC  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  INCISION @ 8:45AM, CARDIAC ARREST 10:35AM, CARDIAC ELECTROGRAPHIC FUNCTION RETURN 12:31PM.  RUNNING ISOFLURANE @ .5 WITH PERFUSIONIST, ISOFLURANE WITH ANS.    EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. After intubation background goes into an infrequent burst suppression pattern. About 15 minutes later the background becomes diffuse slow with intermixed diffuse beta sometimes seen mainly frontally. This continued with varying degrees of slowing depending on the anesthetic. The patient had cardiac arrest an no focal changes where seen. After cardiac function returns the background remains symmetric and with diffuse slowing until the end of the study.  Sleep is not captured  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  IMPRESSION: This is an uneventful Intraoperative EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: Uneventful EEG during aortic surgery,
