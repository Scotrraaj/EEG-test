HISTORY: 75 y.o. female with a history of seizures, now presents in status epilepticus.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 200 mg zonisamide (ZONEGRAN) capsule 100 mg lacosamide (VIMPAT) tablet 200 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL   SEDATION: propofol  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   BACKGROUND: There is no PDR or AP gradient.  At the beginning of the recording, the background consists of burst-suppression pattern.  Bursts last ~ 1-3 seconds occur every ~3-7 seconds and consist of a mixture of fast frequencies.  As the recording progresses, the degree of burst suppression lessens. It is related to decrease in the amount of sedating agents used.  By the end of the recording the background consists of diffuse polymorphic delta activity.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected    IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal ~16 hour long term video EEG due to severe diffuse slowing.  This finding is indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but in this case is at least partially related to the medication effect.  No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
