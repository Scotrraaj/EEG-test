HISTORY:

22 y.o. male with a history of EPISODE ON 10/21/16  FEELING OF STIFF
NECK FOLLOW BY LOC AND SHAKING LASTING 5 MIN. AND POSTICTAL CONFUSION. ASD
REPAIR AT AGE 5, ASTHMA. PRESENT TODAY FOR 1 HOUR STUDY, PT HAD EPISODE OF
LOSS OF TIME 1 MONTH AGO. He is referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

diltiazem (CARDIZEM CD) 120 mg 24 hr capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.

albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs
every 6 hours as needed for Wheezing.


naproxen (NAPROSYN) 375 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily as needed for up to 360
days.


aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

zonisamide (ZONEGRAN) 100 mg capsule, Take 3 capsules by mouth nightly for 360 days.



SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.




Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
