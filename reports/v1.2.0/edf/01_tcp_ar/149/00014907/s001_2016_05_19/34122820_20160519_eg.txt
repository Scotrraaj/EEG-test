DATE OF STUDY: 05/19/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only




HISTORY:

a 55 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy, developmental delay, ventriculomegaly
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


BANOPHEN ALLERGY 12.5 mg/5 mL liquid, take 5 milliliters by mouth at bedtime

Keppra



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of  symmetric mixture of  beta frequencies,
without a symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior
gradient of frequency and amplitude is absent.





Sleep is not captured



Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 50 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Absence of normal adult wake pattern


2. Replacement with diffuse low voltage beta


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with chronic static encephalopathy.  No
epileptiform features were identified.
