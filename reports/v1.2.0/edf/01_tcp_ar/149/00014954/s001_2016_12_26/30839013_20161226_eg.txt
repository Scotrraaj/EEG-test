HISTORY: 71 y.o. male with a history of pulmonary disease, in MRICU referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events. "in the last 2-3 days has been having episodes of agitation in which he tries to raise his head over the bed and moves it around, associated with hypertension, tachycardia and desaturation. These episodes are short lasting minute but are becoming more frequent. The first days he was following commands even during episodes, but today he has been less and less responsive. " MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) injection 5 mg dextrose 5 %-0.2 % sodium chloride infusion methylprednisolone sodium succinate (Solu-MEDROL) 30 mg in sterile water IV Syringe dexmedetomidine (PRECEDEX) 400 mcg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion midazolam (VERSED) 1 mg/mL injection 1 mg insulin regular 100 units in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion tacrolimus (PROGRAF) capsule 1.5 mg tacrolimus (PROGRAF) capsule 2 mg norepinephrine (LEVOPHED) 16 mg/250 mL (64 mcg/mL) in NSS infusion midazolam (VERSED) 1 mg/mL injection 1 mg dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg famotidine (PEPCID) 40 mg/5 mL (8 mg/mL) suspension 20 mg fentanyl (SUBLIMAZE) 1 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion mycophenolate (CELLCEPT) 500 mg in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+ aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg docusate sodium (COLACE) liquid 100 mg levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) injection 25 mcg fentanyl (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection 50 mcg Senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units SEDATION:  See ABOVE  TECHNIQUE: A BEDSIDE portable 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile/verbal Stimulation.  The video was dropped after 2 AM. There are no technical or team notes regarding clinical exam after 2 AM DAY 1 (12/26/2016, 15:00) BP 136/69  Pulse 66  Temp 98.3 °F (36.8 °C) (Oral)  Resp (!) 27  Ht 5' 10" (1.778 m)  Wt 195 lb 15.8 oz (88.9 kg)  SpO2 97%  PF (!) 8 L/min  BMI 28.12 kg/m2  BACKGROUND: The overall background is continuous,  Symmetric:   Low voltage delta with scant theta. Posterior dominant rhythm was not present. The background is  Slightly reactive, slightly variable in the initial hours of recording.  However, later in the recording there is clear variability, with more theta.  Later sections of the record demonstrate a slower delta pattern  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None EVENTS: none  EKG: A single lead captured HR 72 BPM  DAY 1  24 hour video EEG IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: Initially, low voltage suppressed pattern with scant reactivity or variability, improving to a diffusely slow but clearly reactive pattern. . Medications may be responsive for this pattern for this critically ill ICU patient.  No electrographic seizures were noted, there were no epileptiform discharges and the clinical event of head movement with desaturation was not recorded. These results were discussed with the clinical team at the time of the recording.
