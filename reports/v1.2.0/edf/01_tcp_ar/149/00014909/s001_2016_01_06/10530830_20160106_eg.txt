HISTORY:

54 y.o. female with a history of oxygen

dependent COPD, mental illness, limited education  referred for


routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.  She has had a

handful of events in recent years.  Her caregiver describes the

most recent event at home as occurring with asynchronous motor


activity.  A second event occurred in the emergency room on

presentation during this hospitalization



MEDICATIONS:

Keppra, others




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:




A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a

mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta


activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz


posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically

with eye opening.


Sleep could not be achieved



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.




EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal routine EEG.  There are no clinical or


electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.
