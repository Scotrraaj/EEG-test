DATE OF STUDY: 05/04/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient 





HISTORY:

a 50 y.o. MAN WITH convulsion WHILE BEING PUT ON ECMO. Â PT WITH
SARCOIDOSIS, end stage lung disease



MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA,  FENTANYL DRIP, VERSED DRIP 4, HEPARIN, SILDENAFIL, INSULIN, PROTONIX, SOLU
MEDROL, BENADRYL, BUMETANIDE, CARDIZEM, ZOSYN, VANCOMYCIN




SEDATION: As above. Versed was discontinued and the patient remains on 150 mcg Fentanyl.


TECHNIQUE:


Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed with  21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was
recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system.
This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  the patient was on
ECMO.  He was intubated, initially profoundly unresponsive.

DAY 1 ( May 4- May 5, 2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND:


EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity and  intermittent bursts of diffuse theta activity with absence of the expected
anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Tactile stimulation the patient clearly produces an
increase in theta frequency activity.




Over the course of the day, there is reactivity and variability in the record.  There is also some muscle
artifact.


There are clear state changes noted by May 5, with some sections with more theta, others with lower
voltage delta.


By the morning of the 5th, the patient had some spontaneous movement.

GENERALIZED SLOWING: Marked



FOCAL SLOWING: None


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected


EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 80-114 BPM



IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

24 hour continuous EEG monitoring remarkable for


1. generalized background slowing compatible with pharmacologic coma.

2. No seizures or epileptiform activity.

If additional information is needed, EEG monitoring can be repeated.
