HISTORY:

55 y.o. male with a history of stroke, now

presents with an episode concerning for seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

neurontin




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a


mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta

activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.


Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10-10.5

Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.



During brief drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation

and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



Diffuse excess beta activity is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not


performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 80 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is a normal 23-minute awake and briefly drowsy portable EEG.

There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or


detected.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.


Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication

effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
