HISTORY:

69 y.o. male with a history of cardiac disease, prolonged hospital course, including
prolonged intubation, now with altered mental status.



MEDICATIONS:


No AEDs




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


There is no PDR or AP gradient.


The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude theta and delta
activity.



During sleep, subtle symmetrical sleep spindles are observed.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  Many abnormal QRS complexes are noted
on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Moderate diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.



The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
