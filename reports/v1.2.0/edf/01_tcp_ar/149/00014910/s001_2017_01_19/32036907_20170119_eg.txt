DATE OF STUDY: 01/19/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

 a 77 y.o. male with a history of R MCA lacunar CVA in 2014,now with memory loss
and paroxysmal aphasia,  referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change. Recent
MRI with left MCA infarcts.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth daily.lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 10
mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 12.5 MG split-tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth 2 times daily. rivaroxaban
(XARELTO) 15 mg Tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily (with dinner). aspirin 81 mg chewable tablet,
Take 81 mg by mouth daily. gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 100 mg capsule, Take 300 mg by mouth 3
times daily.


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKGand photic stimulation. Initially the patient is very tremulous
and there is muscle artifact.







EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
theta alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive  8.7 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  Of
note, at times the PDR is less than 8.5 and often the PDR is 0.5 to 1 Hz slower on the left



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by synchronous and symmetric sleep transients, including vertex waves, sleep
spindles, and K complexes. Slow wave sleep is not captured.


Mild, intermittent generalized slowing is present.

No other asymmetries are present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Photic Stimulation: tremor precludes identification of a driving response


EVENTS:There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Irregular



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. A subtle asymmetry with slower faster frequency activity on the left


2. Mild generalized slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with clinical symptoms and imaging.
There were no epileptiform features.
