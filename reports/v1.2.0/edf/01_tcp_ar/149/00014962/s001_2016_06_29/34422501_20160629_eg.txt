DATE OF STUDY: 06/29/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 115 y.o. male with a history of traumatic brain injury, epilepsy and behavioral
issues referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Depakote, others

SEDATION: Ativan



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically  challenging
record and included a single channel of EKG and verbaL stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

During much of the record, the patient is awake at which point the EEG is completely obscured by
muscle.  Briefly, there is a glimpse of a low-voltage pattern with a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm.






During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and and diffuse background slowing are
seen.



Sleep is relatively featureless



Moderate generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: NONE



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a technically limited but abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1.  Generalized background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are nonspecific.  They can be seen in the context of post ictal state or, medication
effect, or other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were available.
Previous EEGs were not available for comparison at this time



Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
