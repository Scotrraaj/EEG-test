DATE OF STUDY: 04/25/16 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: Intraoperative monitoring   HISTORY: a 83 y.o. MAN WHO PRESENTS FOR LEFT CEA.  MEDICATIONS: INDUCTION: LIDOCAINE, FENTANYL, VECURONIUM,,    SURGERY MEDS. SEVOFLURANE, ANCEF, EPHEDERINE, PROTAMINE  TECHNIQUE: A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   INCISION:  8:26AM             HEPARIN:  9:01AM    7000 UNITS +1000 9:58AM, +1000 10:04AM CLAMP:     9:35AM UNCLAMP:  10:43AM  EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left fronto temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  As sedation is given and with changes in blood pressure a diffuse low voltage delta background can be seen intermittently.  With clamping there is no change in the background.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present. However, some sharply contoured frequent discharges where seen in the left anterior temporal region with an atypical field. Some where clearly artifactual.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: 1. No abnormalities reported during the CEA. 2. Intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an uneventful intraoperative 4.5 hrs EEG. There is intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. Please note that the sharply contoured discharges are of unclear significance and may be artifactual. If there clinical concern for seizures a repeated EEG may be beneficial.
