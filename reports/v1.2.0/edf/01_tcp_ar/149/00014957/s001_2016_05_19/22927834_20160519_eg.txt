DATE OF STUDY: 05/19/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 36 y.o. female with a history of recent blackout spell referred for routine EEG for
evaluation of paroxysmal events.


Hx of memory loss, TIA like symptoms.

MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


hydroxychloroquine (PLAQUENIL) 200 mg tablet, Take 200 mg by mouth daily. Indications: Discoid
Lupus Erythematosus


QUINACRINE HCL (QUINACRINE, BULK, MISC), by Misc.(Non-Drug; Combo Route) route.

predniSONE (DELTASONE) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily. Indications: discoid lupus



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:




A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive pattern with scant  dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. Prominent theta is seen in drowsiness



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: elicits a theta pattern.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:




This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.


The patient seems very drowsy.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. There is scant alpha rhythm but this remains a
normal finding.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
