History:

Medications: Sedation: EEG Type:
â€¨22 year old woman with a history of 2 seizures.
Patient remains tense throughout the recording. none

Routine, awake & drowsy

Technique:		International 10-20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
	
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
Additionally, the background contains excess beta activity, sharply contoured diffuse theta activity and
bursts of high amplitude diffuse symmetrical delta activity. Theta and delta activity improve when patient relaxes. Patient remains awake throughout the recording.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities. Patient remains tense throughout the recording with frequent eye blinking artifact observed.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild Other, very tense patient
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 27 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. No clear epileptiform discharges are present, but in this recording subtle focal and generalized epileptiform discharges could have been missed due to general appearance of the background (sharply contoured with high amplitude wavefoms and excess beta activity). A repeat study, ideally with sleep, is recommended. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
