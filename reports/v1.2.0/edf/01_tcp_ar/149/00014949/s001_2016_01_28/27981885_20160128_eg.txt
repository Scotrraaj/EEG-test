CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old male of unknown handedness with

history of liver disease, presented on the 28th with bilateral

subcortical infarcts, right greater than left and chronic


small-vessel ischemic disease, evaluate for change in mental

status.




INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed using

standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.

The patient was relatively somnolent.




DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a

continuous low voltage, diffusely slow pattern.  There is a


mixture of rhythmic delta and theta.  Tactile stimulation of the

patient produces an increase in muscle.




Heart rate:  66 BPM.






IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to generalized


background slowing.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features are

identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat

study if the patient's clinical status improves may be

considered.
