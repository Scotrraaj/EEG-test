DATE OF STUDY: 05/19/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 42 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy, admitted after  Multiple seizures in ED
today referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.


Seizure semiology:

1. Flashing lights, followed by heart racing, she reports shaking. She at times recalls shaking/
trembling. Diffuse trembling. No tongue biting. Urinary incontinence. It is unclear how long she
shakes. Reports confusion afterwards. Current frequency: ~ 6 sz since 4/2016


2. Flashing lights only - only happened once since 4/2016.


MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 50 mg tablet,


levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily for 360 days.

naproxen (NAPROSYN) 375 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily (with meals). With Taper

amLODIPine (NORVASC) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.


ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet,

HINGED KNEE SLEEVE, 1 each by Other route See Admin Instructions. As directed

Albuterol (PROVENTIL,VENTOLIN) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs.




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  STAT bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:



A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
