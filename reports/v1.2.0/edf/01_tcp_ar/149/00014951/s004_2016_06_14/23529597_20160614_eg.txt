HISTORY: 42 y.o. female with a history of a single childhood seizure age 15, treated with unclear medication for unclear duration, with re-emergence of seizures since 4/2016 and multiple admits for seizures in setting of med noncompliance and HTN (BP up to 230s systolic), referred for routine EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.  Patient has been prescribed Keppra 1000 mg q12h but reports taking only 500 mg qhs.  Just prior to the study patient had an episode of flushing followed by body rocking and pelvic thrusting, followed by confusion.  MEDICATIONS: Keppra 1000 mg q12h  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (6/14/2016, 11:18 - 6/15/2016, 06:00)  AEDs: Keppra reduced to 1000 mg in AM, 500 mg in HS  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of alpha with admixed beta.  Occasionally there is mild excess of theta in wakefulness.  Posterior dominant rhythm was present at 10 Hz.  Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured..  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS:   (1) DATE AND TIME:  6/14/2016 at 12:06 EVENT TYPE: Non-epileptic event CLINICAL: The patient pushes the event button and then begins thrusting her neck and trunk forwards and back.  Eyes are closed. She continues doing this for 3 min 23 sec.  She is not tested during this time.  RN reports that when she enters the room, the patient denies having had an event and states that she pushed the button because she had to use the bathroom.  When attending epileptologist interviewed the patient 1 hour later, the patient states she had a migraine headache and then felt confused.  She states that she does not know if she had a seizure and she is unable to describe the symptoms she experiences when having a seizure.  EEG: No EEG changes from background, aside from movement artifact over O2, were seen. Her awake background remains unchanged. DURATION: 3 min 23 sec POSTICTAL CHANGES:  No change in cerebral rhythms EKG: no change in a single EKG lead.  (2) DATE AND TIME:  6/14/2016 at 18:14 EVENT TYPE: Non-epileptic event CLINICAL: patient lying in bed with eyes closed, pushes event button, then has nonrhythmical truncal and neck flexion movements. Tech calls pt at 18:16; pt does not respond. RN arrives at 18:17; eyes remain closed. By 18:18 pt opens her eyes and responds, though verbal responses cannot be clearly heard over video recording. EEG: No EEG changes from background, aside from movement artifact, mainly over P3, were seen. Her awake background remains unchanged. DURATION: 4 min 24 sec POSTICTAL CHANGES:  No change in cerebral rhythms EKG: no change in a single EKG lead.  (3) DATE AND TIME:  6/14/2016 at 20:08 EVENT TYPE: Non-epileptic event CLINICAL: patient lying in bed, facing away from camera, rocks body and head back and forth for 15 seconds. EEG: No EEG changes from background, aside from movement artifact, were seen. Her awake background remains unchanged. DURATION: 15 sec POSTICTAL CHANGES:  No change in cerebral rhythms EKG: no change in a single EKG lead.   EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 80s.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Occasional mild excess of theta in wakefulness 2. Episodes of body rocking captured described above, without associated ictal change in cerebral rhythms, most consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Episodes above consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (6/15/2016, 06:00 - 6/16/2016, 06:00)  AEDs: Keppra STOPPED  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS:   (1) DATE AND TIME:  6/15/2016 at 08:26 EVENT TYPE: Event of unclear etiology CLINICAL: patient lying in bed, pushes nursing button complaining of "hearing sounds in left ear," just after RN brings in breakfast tray EEG: No EEG changes from background, aside from movement artifact, were seen. Her awake background remains unchanged. DURATION: unclear POSTICTAL CHANGES:  No change in cerebral rhythms EKG: no change in a single EKG lead.  (2) DATE AND TIME:  6/15/2016 at 09:25 EVENT TYPE: Non-epileptic event CLINICAL: patient lying in bed, pushes nursing button and develops nonrhythmic, waxing-waning neck and trunk flexion, similar to prior episodes. Eyes remain closed and she does not answer the tech or follow commands. On rounds this day, patient endorses the typical "lights flashing" semiology she feels at home. EEG: No EEG changes from background, aside from movement artifact, were seen. Her awake background remains unchanged. DURATION: unclear POSTICTAL CHANGES:  No change in cerebral rhythms EKG: no change in a single EKG lead.  (3) DATE AND TIME:  6/15/2016 at 13:59 EVENT TYPE: Event of unclear etiology CLINICAL: patient complaining of "ringing/buzzing in left ear." She does not push event button, rather nursing call button. EEG: No EEG changes from background were seen. Her awake background remains unchanged. DURATION: unclear POSTICTAL CHANGES:  No change in cerebral rhythms EKG: no change in a single EKG lead.  (4) DATE AND TIME:  6/15/2016 at 15:57 EVENT TYPE: Non-epileptic event CLINICAL: patient lying in bed, pushes nursing button and begins to have nonrhythmic, waxing-waning neck and trunk flexion, this time with mild pelvic thrusting and hip adduction as well. Eyes remain closed and she does not answer the tech or follow commands. By 148 seconds, she follows commands to raise right and left hands, though eyes remain closed. She does not follow more complex commands. Patient opens eyes spontaneously at end of event. EEG: No EEG changes from background, aside from movement artifact, were seen. Her awake background remains unchanged. DURATION: 3 min 28 sec POSTICTAL CHANGES:  No change in cerebral rhythms EKG: no change in a single EKG lead.  (5) DATE AND TIME:  6/15/2016 at 23:59 EVENT TYPE: Non-epileptic event CLINICAL: similar to 6/15/2016 15:57 event EEG: No EEG changes from background, aside from movement artifact, were seen. Her awake background remains unchanged. DURATION: 4 min POSTICTAL CHANGES:  No change in cerebral rhythms EKG: no change in a single EKG lead.  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change in background. Events involving body rocking captured described above, as on day 1, do not involve change in cerebral rhythms and are consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events. Events involving hearing ringing/buzzing in left ear do not involve change in cerebral rhythms and are of unclear etiology. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (6/16/2016, 06:00 - 6/16/2016, 17:01)  AEDs: Keppra CONTINUES TO BE HELD  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:    PHOTIC STIMULATION: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps), performed 6/16/2016 at 11:39, induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.    HYPERVENTILATION: Hyperventilation is performed 6/16/2016 at 11:47 for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected Patient signed out against medical advice 6/16/2016 17:01.  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change in background. No clinical or electrographic events. Patient signed out against medical advice 6/16/2016 17:01. -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Occasional mild excess of theta in wakefulness 2. Episodes of body rocking captured described above, without associated ictal change in cerebral rhythms, most consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events. For some of these events, the patient reported her typical habitual semiology of "lights flashing" preceding the onset of shaking. For most, however, she was unable to remember her symptoms when questioned afterwards. 3. Episodes involving hearing ringing/buzzing in left ear do not involve change in cerebral rhythms and are of unclear etiology.   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.   The episodes of body shaking described above, some of which involved the patient's typical habitual semiology of "lights flashing" at onset, had no EEG cerebral correlate and are most consistent with nonepileptic behavioral events.  The episodes involving hearing ringing/buzzing in left ear did not involve change in cerebral rhythms, and are of unclear etiology.   There were no epileptiform features seen on this 3-day video EEG, even after Keppra was held.  The patient signed out against medical advice on 6/16/2016.
