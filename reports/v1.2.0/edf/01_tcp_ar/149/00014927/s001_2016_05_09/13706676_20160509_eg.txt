HISTORY:

83 y.o.MAN WITH CC OF LUE WORSENING WEAKNESS THEN GTC SZ WITH
LEFT GAZE DEVIATION IN ER.  PMHX: POSTERIOR MCA INF 3/15. CAD S/P STENTS, CA
(PROSTATE, BASAL CELL SKIN)

MEDICATIONS:

KEPPRA, FENTANYL (5/8), INSULIN, SYNTHROID, METFORMIN,A TORVASTATIN, LISINOPRIL,
PROTONIX, PROSCAR, METOPROLOL, FAMOTIDINE.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right mid-temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. intermittent focal slowing in the right midtemporal region


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the right
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.
