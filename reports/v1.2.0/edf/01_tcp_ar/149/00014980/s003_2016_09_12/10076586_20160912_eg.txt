START DATE OF STUDY: 09/11/16 at 13:37 END DATE OF STUDY: 09/14/16 at 03:30  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 53 y.o. male with a history of PVD who underwent angiogram on 9/11, was extubated, initially followed commands, then became unresponsive with tonic posturing of arms and was reintubated and placed on a propofol drip, referred for EEG for assessment of mental status change and screening for subclinical seizures.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: lactated ringers infusion dextrose 5 % and sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB  SEDATION: Propofol, Ativan *Immediately before the study was connected, tech witnessed patient having lip smacking, then vomiting, then left eyelid and left facial twitching  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (9/11/2016, 13:37 - 9/12/2016, 06:00) Propofol downtitrated from 50 mcg/kg/min to 40 mcg/kg/min  BACKGROUND: The background consists of suppressed delta activity. There is no reactivity, variability, or state change. There is severe generalized slowing.  There are occasional spontaneous eyeblinks.  Study is disconnected 9/11/2016 from 22:00 - 9/12/2016 00:00.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: The following events are captured:  9/11/2016 at 13:51 Staff pushes button for left eyelid twitching EEG: there is no seizure on EEG, only brief low amplitude muscle artifact, during this time  Throughout the rest of the day, there are additional 5-10 second runs of muscle artifact over the left > right fronto-temporal leads. There is no underlying seizure activity during these runs of muscle activity.  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 90s-100s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing, disorganization, and lack of reactivity 2. Episode of left eye twitching, which did not correlate with seizure activity on EEG  These findings are consistent with a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is at least in part due to a medication effect.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (9/12/2016, 06:00 - 9/13/2016, 06:00) Propofol shut off 9/12/2016 08:00. It is restarted at 9/12 09:00 (30 mcg/kg/min) following below event, then shut off again 9/12 13:00.  BACKGROUND: By 9/12/2016 08:00, higher amplitude delta activity emerges over the bilateral posterior regions. This activity disappears after 09:00 and re-emerges ~11:00. By 14:00, an amplitude asymmetry develops, with emergence of relatively higher amplitude activity over the right hemispheric leads. This asymmetry disappears following seizure at 14:27.  Over the evening, increasing prevalence of delta develops: first blunt delta waves occurring every 4-5 seconds, then a more continuous delta pattern, especially prominent over the left frontal (F3>Fp1/Fz) region.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: severe  FOCAL SLOWING: none  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS:  9/12/2016 at 08:55 CLINICAL: Patient is has twitching of right side of face, throat muscles, and jaw, with contaction of neck movements and rapid blinking, then spread to shoulders. Video partially obscured by staff, but the activity spreads to left side of face, then gradually resolve. This resolves after 2 min and he is briefly still, but then at 08:57 his shoulders twitch and his head jerks side to side. This gradually resolves but his lower body appears to continue jerking, with gradual offset (lower body not captured on camera). Eyes are open. EEG: Primarily movement artifact over the right hemispheric leads, with possible spikey activity preceding each movement. At 08:57, activity is primarily movement artifact. Total duration: 3 min 42 sec  Following the above event he is given ativan and propofol gtt increased. Propofol stopped again 9/12 13:00.  9/12/2016 at 14:27 CLINICAL: onset of right facial twitching at 14:30 that spreads to left face and neck within seconds EEG: activity over right hemisphere increases in amplitude gradually at 14:27, becomes semirhythmic delta, then higher amplitude rhythmic delta, then 1.5-2 Hz spike-wave, increasing in amplitude, until abrupt offset at 14:31. There is some reflection over left hemispheric leads.  9/12/2016 at 20:36 CLINICAL: patient appears to have irregular respirations by 20:37. At 20:38 he develops right facial twitch and rapid eye blinking, with head deviation to left and jaw twitch, spreading to neck/shoulders, then truncal twitching. Activity gradually ceases spontaneously by 20:39, but right jaw twitch continues until 20:41. EEG: at 20:36, onset of 2 Hz spike-wave over right occipital (O2) region, with reflection over left occipital (O1) region, spreading to involve entire right hemisphere by 20:38, when it becomes obscured by muscle artifact. Total duration: 5 min 1 sec.  Following this episode he receives valproic acid.  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 100s-120s  DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION 1. Emergence of amplitude asymmetry, with attenuation over the left hemisphere, that disappears following seizure on 9/12 14:30 and gradually re-emerges 2. Three episodes of twitching spreading from R face to L face, then neck, then shoulders, clinically most consistent with focal seizure activity with spread.  3. Tachycardia  These findings are consistent with left hemisphere cortical dysfunction, and focal seizures that clinically begin over the left hemisphere. However, there is no definite cerebral correlate on EEG for the first seizure, and seizure activity evolves over the RIGHT hemisphere for the 2nd and 3rd seizures, supportive of bi-hemispheric dysfunction.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (9/13/2016, 06:00 - 9/14/2016, 03:30)  Study disconnects 9/13 17:15-18:25 Primary team disconnects leads 9/14/2016 at 03:30.  BACKGROUND: diffuse delta with admixed low amplitude alpha. By 9/13 14:00, an asymmetry develops over fronto-temporal region, with left side developing nonevolving runs of theta for <1 min  GENERALIZED SLOWING: severe  FOCAL SLOWING: see above  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS:  Intermittently throughout 9/13 evening for hours at a time, there are periodic large amplitude delta waves with triphasic morphology over the bifrontal regions occurring every 3-4 seconds. Electrographically, these resemble eyeblink artifact, but on video, each correlates with 2-3 rapid body jerks.  EKG: A single EKG lead captured an heart rate in the 70s-100s, irregular at times   DAY 3  IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  These findings are supportive of a bi-hemispheric dysfunction. Body jerks on this day as described above, without clear epileptiform correlate. Irregular heart rate       -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Severe generalized slowing, disorganization, and lack of reactivity 2. Emergence of amplitude asymmetry on 9/12, with attenuation over the left hemisphere, that disappears following seizure on 9/12 14:30 and gradually re-emerges, with nonevolving runs of runs of theta over the left fronto-temporal region on 9/13 3. Episode of left eye twitching on 9/11, which did not correlate with seizure activity on EEG 4. Three episodes of twitching spreading from R face to L face, then neck, then shoulders, clinically most consistent with focal seizure activity with spread, on 9/12.  5. Tachycardia and irregular heart rate   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are consistent with a severe diffuse as well as bi-hemispheric cerebral dysfunction that are at least in part due to a medication effect.  Three focal seizures are captured on 9/12 as described above, that clinically localize to the left hemisphere.  However, there is no definite cerebral correlate on EEG for the first seizure, and seizure activity evolves over the RIGHT hemisphere for the 2nd and 3rd seizures, supportive of bi-hemispheric dysfunction.  There were no definite seizures following administration of valproic acid on 9/12. Body jerks captured on 9/13 had no clear epileptiform correlate.
