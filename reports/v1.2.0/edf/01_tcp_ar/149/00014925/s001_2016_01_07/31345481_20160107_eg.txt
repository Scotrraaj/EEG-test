History:	43 year old woman with a history of a recent seizure.  Patient has a history of 
	alcohol abuse.  She reports having an alcoholic drink this am.
	
	Of note, difficult EEG hook up due to the condition of patient's hair.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The background consists of diffuse excess beta activity.  During drowsiness, brief bursts of theta 
activity and vertex waves are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse 
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) 
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
	No epileptiform discharges
	No stage 2 sleep
	Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake and briefly drowsy 21-minute EEG. No epileptiform discharges are 
present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep 
recording may provide additional information.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the 
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
