HISTORY:

58 y.o. male with a history of seizures, last occurring more than one year ago,
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

Hydrocortisone Acetate (MEDI-CORTISONE) 1 % Cream, Apply 1 Applicatorful topically 2 times daily.

nitroGLYCERIN (NITROSTAT) 0.4 mg SL tablet, Place 0.4 mg under the tongue every 5 minutes as
needed.




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:




A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The predominant background activity consists of generalized low voltage 20-30 Hz activity and
superimposed muscle artifact. A small amount of poorly sustained low amplitude 10-11 Hz rhythmic
activity was seen posteriorly.  During much of the tracing, the patient appeared drowsy, with
intermixed beta activity and low voltage bilateral 3-6 Hz activity.




Brief stage II sleep is accompanied by vertex waves and increased generalized slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
