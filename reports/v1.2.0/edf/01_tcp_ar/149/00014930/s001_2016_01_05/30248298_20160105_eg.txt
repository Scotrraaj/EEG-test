AGE: 56 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 01/05/2016
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep EEG #: 16-21

HISTORY:
56 y.o. male with a history of depression, alcohol abuse ("clean for 3 years")	and seizures ("ringing in ears, losing time, drooling, then LOC, fall with shaking") referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures. Per patient the ringing in his ears occurs every week or so. The LOC occurs once a year.

MEDICATIONS: DILANTIN, REMIRON, ZOLOFT, BUSPAR, TERAZOSIN SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation .

EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation -and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric sleep spindles and K-complexes . Slow wave sleep was not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiforrn activity is present.

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces . no effect.

Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.

EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
