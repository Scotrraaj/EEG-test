HISTORY:

27 y.o. female with a history of R sphenoid wing meningioma s/p craniotomy and
seizures (last approximately 3 wks ago) referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

sertraline (ZOLOFT) 100 mg tablet,

mirtazapine (REMERON) 15 mg tablet,


ARIPIPRAZOLE (ABILIFY PO), Take  by mouth.

LURASIDONE HCL (LATUDA PO), Take  by mouth.

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.


ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 200 mg tablet, Take 400 mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed.
Indications: Headache Disorder


LORazepam (ATIVAN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth 3 times daily.

mirtazapine (REMERON SOL-TAB) 15 mg disintegrating tablet, Take 15 mg by mouth nightly.





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and excess beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves.
Features of stage II sleep not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

Occasional R > L bitemporal synchronous and independent polymorphic slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with poor cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.






HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Occasional R > L bitemporal synchronous and independent polymorphic slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of bitemporal (R>L) dysfunction.


Excess beta activity may be seen in the setting of a medication effect (i.e., benzodiazepines,
barbiturates).
