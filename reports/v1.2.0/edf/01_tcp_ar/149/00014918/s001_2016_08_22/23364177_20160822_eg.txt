This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. F7/T3 electrodes were placed in close proximity causing low amplitude artifact. This was fixed during the study. COOLING: 28@ 9:50AM CARDIAC ARREST @10:03AM  EEG BACKGROUND: No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. After 10:44 AM, the EEG becomes completely suppressed. Around 12:15 PM, the bursts of generalized delta activity are seen. At the end of the record, there is diffuse symmetric delta waves seen.   Sleep is not captured  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: Uneventful EEG during intra operative monitoring.  CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Uneventful EEG during intra operative monitoring.
