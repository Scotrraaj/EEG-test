DATE OF STUDY: 05/23/16 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: Intraoperative monitoring   HISTORY: a 53 y.o. WOMAN PRESENTS FOR REMOVAL OF THROMBUS FROM PUMONARY ARTERY/VEIN  MEDICATIONS: INDUCTION MEDS: ISOFLURANE, FENTANYL, MIDAZOLAM, VECU, PROPOFOL  SEDATION: As above.  TECHNIQUE: A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record with some artifacts described below and included a single channel of EKG.    7:52:54 AM:  INTUBATING PT  9:16:55 AM: INCISION  11:46:08 AM: STARTING TO COOL  11:50:00 AM: CARDIAC ARREST 12:14:03 PM: ARTIFACT FROM COOLING OF HEAD  12:22:22 PM: SPOKE WITH DR. TOYODA  1:08:27 PM: GROUND AND REF JELLED DUE TO ARTIFACT  1:09:48 PM: ANS TURNED OFF 1 DEVISE / STILL HEAR HUMMING SOUND ?- ARTIFACT  2:14:48 PM: START REWARMING  2:17:00 PM: EKG RETURNS    EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Sleep is not captured  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during induction and with sedation.  During induction a sudden background change is noted and diffuse theta is seen. Later as the patient is cooled a more diffuse delta background is noted. I addition focal delta over the left temporal region is seen this continues as the background progressively becomes attenuated and later completely suppressed. Once suppresed a notable artifact is seen over the left temporal electrodes and with diffuse muscle artifact.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Transient epileptiform discharges are seen with deep cooling.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: 1. Left mid-temporal focal slow waves  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an uneventful EEG for intraoperative monitoring. The intermittent focal slowing in the left mid-temporal region is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
