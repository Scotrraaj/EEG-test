HISTORY:

29 y.o. female with a pmh of asthma, anxiety, prior suicide attempt, and
fibromyalgia. Presenting with chronic headaches.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) 10 mg tablet, 10 mg daily as needed.

CETIRIZINE HCL (ZYRTEC PO), Take  by mouth daily.


GABAPENTIN PO, Take 600 mg by mouth daily.

prednisone (DELTASONE) 20 mg tablet, 3 pills daily for 3 days, 2 pills daily for 3 days, then 1 pill
daily for 3 days


FLUTICASONE/SALMETEROL (ADVAIR DISKUS IN), Inhale  into the lungs.



Albuterol (PROVENTIL,VENTOLIN) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every 6
hours as needed.



Current Facility-Administered Medications:


ipratropium-albuterol (DUO-NEB) nebulizer solution 3 mL





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.





Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
