HISTORY: Female 1 Unk Caus Eh is a 55 y.o. female with a history of HIV, hepatitis, and substance abuse who was using heroin today when she was noted to be apneic and seizing. She was taken to Episcopal ED where she was given Valium 10 mg, Ativan 8 mg, fosphenytoin 1 mg, phenobarbital 1600 mg, and intubated and started on Propofol. She is now referred for EEG for treatment of status epilepticus.  MEDICATIONS: as in history  SEDATION: as above. Propofol stopped at 21:00, restarted at 15 mcg/kg/hr overnight day 1.  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (7/25/2016, 23:56 - 7/26/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, but poorly organized, and consists predominantly of delta with admixed alpha and beta. There is no clear reactivity, variability, or state change. Large portions of the record are obscured by diffuse muscle artifact.  Severe generalized slowing is present.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  Muscle artifact as above  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 60s-70s  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Severe generalized slowing, disorganized background, with lack of reactivity  These findings are consistent with severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may at least in part be associated with a medication effect. -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (7/26/2016, 06:00 - 7/27/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: By noon on this day, state change is present: periods of relative wakefulness consist of diffuse delta with superimposed alpha and excess beta with poor organization. Periods of quiet consist of delta with <1 sec periods of attenuation. Note that record is disconnected on 7/26 between 14:20-14:36 and 15:21-16:12.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: Mild-moderate  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 60s   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Improvement in degree of background slowing to mild-moderate. Excess beta may be seen in the setting of a medication effect (benzodiazepines/barbiturates). -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (7/27/2016, 06:00 - 7/27/2016, 08:41)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured a heart rate in the 70s   DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  No change from day 2 -----------------------------------------------------------------  FINAL IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG due to:  1. Generalized slowing, which improves by day 2 from severe to mild-moderate 2. Suboptimal organization   FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings indicate the presence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which improves by day 2 from severe to mild-moderate. These findings may at least in part be associated with a medication effect.  Excess beta activity can be seen in the setting of medication such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
