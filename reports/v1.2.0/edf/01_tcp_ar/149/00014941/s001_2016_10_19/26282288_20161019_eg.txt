HISTORY: 48 y.o. female P/W SOB, here today for pulmonary thrombectomy  MEDICATIONS: Induction meds: Etomidate, Fentanyl, Versed, Lidocaine, Rocuronium  SEDATION: see above  TECHNIQUE: A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  Incision: 1013 Heparin: 25000 @ 1036 Cooling: 1050 Supression:1146 Cirrculatory Arrest: 1204 Cardiac Arrest: 1103 Warming: 1249   EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. However, there is excessive theta seen in the background.  Sleep is not captured  As sedation is given the background rapidly becomes diffusely slow and progressively (faster than usual) more attenuated. At times there is intermittent focal delta in the temporal regions. There are also intermittent sharp waves seen with cooling.   The EEG is declared suppressed with cooling around 11:45AM.  At the patient is warmed the are asymmetries seen intermittently.   The background remains diffusely slow in the theta/delta range but continuous at the end of the record.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: No epileptiform activity is present.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This an uneventful EEG during PTE surgery.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This an uneventful EEG during PTE surgery. Changes were reported to the team as they occurred.
