DATE OF STUDY: 04/28/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 34 y.o. female with a history of  absence SZ and GSZ since she was 15. Patient
recalled that she was having absence SZ every day and GSZ per every 2-3 month since she was 15.
Currently, she does not take anti-SZ meds.referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

LATUDA 20 mg Tablet,


acetaminophen-codeine (TYLENOL W/CODEINE) 120-12 mg/5 mL Solution, take 10 MLS TO 15
MLS by mouth every 4 to 6 hours if needed for pain



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:





A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG. HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior 40 UV dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding. Patient was falling asleep in Photic.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG. Neither HV nor photic activated the record.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. If the patient has frequent
spells, a 1 hour or 24 hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.
