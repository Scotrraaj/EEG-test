DATE OF STUDY: 01/15/2016

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only

EEG #: 16-101



HISTORY:

a 36 y.o. male with a history of new onset

recurrent convulsions with ++ family history referred for routine


EEG for characterization of seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


Keppra, symbicort




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation. The




patient is very drowsy, barely ever awake.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is low voltage, symmetric, reactive, and


consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal

beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior

gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and

reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which


attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.  Snore arousals were noted.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: produces scant driving despite the


drowsiness



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG.  There are no

clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of

epilepsy.

Evaluation for hypersomnolence may be indicated.


Attending Epileptologist:

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents


my findings and conclusions.
