DATE OF STUDY: 01/05/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep



HISTORY:

a 39 y.o. male with a history of hypothalamic tumor, VP shunt in place, patient
continues to have staring spells one to 3 times per day, referred for routine EEG for characterization
of seizures.


Recent MRI brain:  Overall, there has been interval decrease in T2 weighted


hyperintense signal and enhancement within previously noted regions

and including thalamus, hypothalamus, right anterior commissure and

cerebellum. No new abnormal signal or enhancement is identified. Stable size and configuration of
the ventricles, with two shunt catheters in place.

TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG,HV  and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10.4 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is limited but includes spindles.



No generalized slowing is present.

Subtle focal slowing is present, noted only in drowsiness, in the context of breach rhythm, there is
focal slowing in the right frontocentral region with isolated delta theta and some beta accentuation.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:



None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.




Photic Stimulation: Patient seemed drowsy and the right frontocentral focal slowing was accentuated


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1.  Subtle right frontocentral focal slowing in context of breach rhythm



CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are frequently found in association with structural brain
pathology as described above.  No epileptiform features were identified.  The patient staring spells
were not captured.  This patient will go on to inpatient EEG monitoring in an attempt to identify and
manage these daily events
