DATE OF STUDY: 06/22/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep



HISTORY:

a 51 y.o. male with a history of recurrent seizures, attributed to alcohol use or
medication noncompliance referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Depakote


SEDATION: none



TECHNIQUE:

A  Bedside Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation. The
patient was very drowsy



EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is brief but includes symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha
and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior
gradient.  wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by abundant spindle and some vertex waves

No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.


Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
