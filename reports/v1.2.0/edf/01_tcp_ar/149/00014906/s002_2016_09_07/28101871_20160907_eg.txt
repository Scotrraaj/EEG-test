HISTORY:

58 y.o. male with a history of seizure 3 years ago and recent breakthrough
convulsion with loss of consciousness and incontinence one week ago, referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.

fenofibrate (TRICOR) 54 mg tablet, Take 54 mg by mouth daily.


FLUoxetine (PROZAC) 20 mg capsule, Take 20 mg by mouth 2 times daily.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, hyperventilation, and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background consists of symmetric and reactive 10-15 uV amplitude 9-10 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Low amplitude
frontocentral beta activity was seen with frontal eye blink artifact. EKG artifact was also noted.



During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.




Brief stage II sleep was seen characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and
symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.






EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 50 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
