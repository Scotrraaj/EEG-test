 HISTORY:

 Male Unknown White is a 45 y.o. male referred for routine EEG

 while undergoing rewarming from hypothermia protocol. He was


 found down in his car by EMS, surrounded by drug paraphenalia.

 NULL

 MEDICATIONS: aspirin, Plavix, heparin, protonix, humulin,


 dextrose, epinephrine

 NULL

 SEDATION: as above


 NULL

 TECHNIQUE:

 A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the


 International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes was performed

 utilizing a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory

 record and included a single channel of EKG.


 NULL




 EEG BACKGROUND:

 The background is suppressed and is contaminated by persistent


 EKG artifact in all leads.  There is no evidence of variability

 or reactivity to painful stimulation or to loud auditory


 stimulus. There is no state change.

 NULL

 EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

 No epileptiform activity is present.


 NULL

 OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


 None

 NULL

 ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

 NULL


 Hyperventilation: Not performed

 NULL


 Photic Stimulation: Not performed

 NULL

 EVENTS:

 There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


 this study.

 NULL


 HEART RATE:

 A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

 NULL

 IMPRESSION:


 This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:

 1. Suppressed background rhythms without evidence for


 variability, reactivity, or state change

 NULL

 CLINICAL CORRELATION:

 These findings indicate profound cerebral dysfunction, which may


 be seen in the setting of hypothermia.
