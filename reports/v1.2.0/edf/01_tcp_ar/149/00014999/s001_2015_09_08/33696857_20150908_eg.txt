HISTORY:
45 y.o. male referred for routine EEG while undergoing rewarming from hypothermia protocol. He was found down in his car by EMS, surrounded by drug paraphenalia.

MEDICATIONS: aspirin, Plavix, heparin, protonix, humulin, dextrose, epinephrine
SEDATION: as above TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) recording using the
International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilizing a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.

EEG BACKGROUND:
The background is suppressed and is contaminated by persistent EKG artifact in all leads.	There is no evidence of variability or reactivity to painful stimulation or to loud auditory stimulus. There is no state change.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM)
None

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Hyperventilation: Not performed Photic Stimulation:Not performed
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:
1. Suppressed background rhythms without evidence for variability, reactivity, or state change

CLINICAL CORRELATION :
These findings indicate profound cerebral dysfunction, which may be seen in the setting of hypothermia.
