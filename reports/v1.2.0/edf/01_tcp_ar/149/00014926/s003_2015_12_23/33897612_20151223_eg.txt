Medications:	NO AED Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpatient), 24 hrs
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg electrodes, comatose

Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present. Frequent focal spikes are present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at CZ. At times they become quasi-rhythmic but have no clear evolution. At the end of the record with stimulation the sharp waves become more rhythmic but there is no clear evolution, more consistent with a stimulus induced rhythmic discharge. (SIRPID).
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. Hr was 120
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent central
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL
 
EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the central region. These a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. The SIRPID is concerning and

findings are indicative of on continuous EEG monitoring. In addition there is severe diffuse background
