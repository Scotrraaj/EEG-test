Continuous (inpatient), 24 hrs
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg electrodes, comatose

Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for_ hours from 12/23/2015 to 12/2/2015. Nursing­ initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior. Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the attending neurologist for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.

Description of pushbutton events

Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left central region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. Frequent focal spikes are present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at CZ. Infrequent Seizures: At times these discharges become more rhythmic for 2-3 minutes on two clear occasions. Consistent with electrographic seizures. Last clear seizure was at 9am on 12/23/2015.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. HR was 132
Summary of Findings:
Seizure, rare, electrographic central Sharp waves, frequent central
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left central
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of rare central subclinical seizures and very frequent sharp waves consistent with an epileptogenic focus in that region. In addition, there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction
