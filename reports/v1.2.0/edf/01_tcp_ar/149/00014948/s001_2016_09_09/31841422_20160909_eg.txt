DATE OF STUDY: 09/09/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 45 y.o. male with a history of liver disease, syncope and chest pain referred
for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.


After walking three blocks, he suddenly felt lightheaded, hot due to weather and passed out with face
on ground so wife could not see face, eyes or front of body but saw him shaking for briefly (maybe 1
min) after which he woke up and said " oh gosh, I peed on myself". Soon, he had 2 more similar
episodes again for very brief amount of time.  Found to have ventricular bigeminy.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


propranolol (INDERAL) tablet 20 mg

ferrous sulfate tablet 325 mg

furosemide (LASIX) tablet 40 mg


spironolactone (ALDACTONE) tablet 25 mg

methadone (DOLOPHINE) oral solution 124 mg

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


gabapentin (NEURONTIN) capsule 800 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and  stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive  10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is
excess background rhythmic theta noted



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  One prominent feature of drowsiness is
rhythmic slowing to theta frequency activity. Deeper stages of sleep were not captured



Modest generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Verbal stimulation produces an alerting response

EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 50 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Excess theta


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are nonspecific.  This patient's medications or underlying systemic problems could
produce the theta described above.
