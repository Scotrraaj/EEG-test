SEDATION: Fentanyl


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically suboptimal record
with excessive muscle artifact, and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The patient was intubated during the tracing, intermittently biting on the ET tube. During the study,
medical staff was at the bedside performing examination, stimulation and blood glucose monitoring.
Background is characterized by the diffuse low to medium and medium amplitude poorly organized
3-6 Hz activity intermixed with frequent triphasic waves and occasional frontal eye blink artifact. A
large amount of muscle artifact was seen over predominantly frontotemporal regions, obscuring
portions of the underlying cerebral electrical activity. No significant change in background activity
was seen after tactile stimulation.





EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None apart from triphasic activity noted above.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None





ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 105 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep  routine EEG due to:

1. Background disorganization and diffuse irregular slowing.

2. Frequent triphasic activity.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate a moderate bihemispheric functional disturbance such as that seen with
diffuse or multifocal encephalopathies of various etiologies. The triphasic activity noted is typically
seen with metabolic disturbances including hepatic disease, hypoxia, or renal insufficiency, e.g. No
clinical or electrographic seizure activity was noted.
