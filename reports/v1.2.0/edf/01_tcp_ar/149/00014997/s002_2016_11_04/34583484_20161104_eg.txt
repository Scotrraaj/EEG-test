HISTORY: 54 y.o. female with a history of h/o autoimmune hepatitis and liver failure with a complicated hospital course including s/p ex lap for bowel perforation and drain placement, sepsis, renal failure followed by acute respiratory failure for which she got intubated and currently requiring respiratory support and pressor support, who was noted to have right sided arm and head shaking 11/3 evening which lasted 10 seconds and then resolved referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events, screening for subclinical seizures and assessment of mental status change.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: Custom Option CPN meropenem (MERREM) 1 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB fentanyl (PF) (SUBLIMAZE) injection 25 mcg chlorhexidine (PERIDEX) 0.12 % solution 15 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units linezolid (ZYVOX) 600 mg in 300 mL IVPB insulin regular 100 units in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg Hydromorphone (DILAUDID) injection 0.5 mg white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application norepinephrine (LEVOPHED) 16 mg/250 mL (64 mcg/mL) in NSS infusion pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 5 mg ipratropium (ATROVENT) 0.02 % nebulizer solution 0.5 mg acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg nystatin (MYCOSTATIN) powder 1 Application polyvinyl alcohol (LIQUIFILM TEARS) 1.4 % ophthalmic solution 2 drop albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 2.5 mg white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application micafungin (MYCAMINE) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (11/4/2016, 15:25 - 11/5/2016, 12:17)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, fairly organized, and reactive.  Background consists of predominantly theta-range frequencies with a symmetric posterior dominant rhythm of 5 Hz.   There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Drowsiness is characterized by further background slowing and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm.  Sleep is characterized by rudimentary sleep spindles and K-complexes.  Note that portions of the background are obscured by muscle artifact, in particular affecting the bitemporal regions, and particularly from 11/5 10:00 until end of study.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Frequent right central (P4>C4 max) sharp waves, activated by wakeful state 2. Occasional right temporal (T4/T6 max) sharp waves, activated by wakeful state 3. Occasional left temporal (F7/T3) sharp waves, activated by wakeful state 4. Frequent left fronto-central (F3/C3) sharp waves, activated by wakeful state 5. Frequent right fronto-central (F4>C4) sharp waves, at times synchronous with #4, activated by wakeful state 6. Occasional right occipital (O2) sharp waves, activated by wakeful state 7. Occasional diffuse sharp waves with triphasic morphology, activated by wakeful state  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 90s-100s  FINAL IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Multifocal and diffuse sharp waves with triphasic morphology as above No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.  FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are indicative of multifocal epileptogenic potential superimposed on a moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Sharp waves with triphasic morphology are most commonly seen in association with toxic-metabolic states.  There were no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected. No electrographic seizures.
