DATE OF STUDY: 06/24/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 40-60 min (1 hr 1 min), awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 24 y.o. female with a history of seizures referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS: Lamictal



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of mostly low voltage fast frequencies.
Posterior dominant rhythm consists of low voltage fast frequencies.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing, with increased theta frequencies, are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any change.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hr EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported
or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hr EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

Note that this is the 3rd normal EEG for this patient.









Attending Epileptologist: 

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
