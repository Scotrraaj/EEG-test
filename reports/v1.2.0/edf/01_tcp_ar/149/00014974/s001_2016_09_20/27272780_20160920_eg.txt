HISTORY:

25 y.o. female with a history of long standing epilepsy, spastic CP,
developmental delay, VBS, porencephalic cyst, and strabismus, with 1 seizure per week, referred for
routine EEG for characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


zonisamide (ZONEGRAN) 100 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily for 360 days. 1 at bed for
two weeks, then 2 at bed

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) 100 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH AT ONSET OF A
PROLONGED SEIZURE AS NEEDED (Patient taking differently: TAKE 2 TABLET BY MOUTH AT
ONSET OF A PROLONGED SEIZURE AS NEEDED)



levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET IN THE       MORNING AND TAKE 2
TABLETS AT BEDTIME


LAMICTAL XR 200 mg Tablet Extended Rel 24 hr (b), Take 200 mg by mouth daily. Disp 90 day
supply
levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET IN THE       MORNING AND 2 TABLETS
AT  BEDTIME (Patient taking differently: Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times daily.)


folic acid (FOLVITE) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.



PARoxetine (PAXIL) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every morning.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is continuous and reactive but asymmetric.

The right hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of alpha and excess beta frequencies,
with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8-8.5 Hz.


The left hemisphere consists of a fairly organized mixture of alpha, excess beta, and excess theta
frequencies, with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 7-8 Hz.



During a brief period of drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm
with further background slowing and high amplitude theta are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Continuous left hemispheric slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.





EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization

2. Continuous left hemispheric slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of left hemispheric dysfunction, likely structural in etiology,
superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


Excess beta activity is consistent with this patient's documented use of phenobarbital.
