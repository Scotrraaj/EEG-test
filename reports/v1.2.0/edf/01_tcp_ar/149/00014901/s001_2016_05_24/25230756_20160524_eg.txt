HISTORY:

43 y.o. female with a history of small fiber neuropathy referred for EEG to
characterize episodes of myoclonic jerks of left side, and periods of whole body is tightness and
shakiness.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


DULoxetine (CYMBALTA) 60 mg capsule,

baclofen (LIORESAL) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11-12 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





Near constant eye flutter artifact is present throughout the recording.


Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake only routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected. Near constant eye flutter artifact is noted.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only routine EEG.



A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
