HISTORY:

27 y.o. female with a history of staring spell with weakness referred for routine
EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg/actuation Aerosol Powdr Breath Activated, INHALE 2 PUFFS
TWICE A DAY RINSE OUT MOUTH AFTER USE


OCELLA 3-0.03 mg per tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY DAY

fluconazole (DIFLUCAN) 150 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH ONCE A WEEK


JUNEL FE 1/20, 28, 1 mg-20 mcg (21)/75 mg (7) per tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH DAILY,
STARTING ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.


SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system  with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.  Generous beta was seen



Sleep is not captured


No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Does not activate the record


Photic Stimulation: Elicits vigorous, bilateral driving



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:





This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If needed, a more
prolonged study capturing sleep may be obtained
