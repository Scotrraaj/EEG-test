History:	82 year old woman who presents with an episode concerning for a seizure.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, asleep, lethargic, obtunded
Description:
There is marked right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  The 
background over the right consists of fragmented 7 Hz PDR, poor AP gradient and excess 
polymorphic theta activity.  The background over the left consists of attenuated slow delta activity.  
Sleep spindles are captured.  They are better visualized over the right.
  Gaze deviation towards the left is captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an 
irregular heart rate up to 120 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
	Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
	Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left hemispheric
	Cardiac arrhythmia
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable 21-minute EEG due to (1) mild-to-moderate 
diffuse slowing and (2) marked left hemispheric focal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild 
to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal 
slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the left - please correlate clinically.  Gaze 
deviation towards the left is captured.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.  A single 
EKG lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate up to 120 bpm.
