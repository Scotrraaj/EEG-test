HISTORY:

43 y.o. WOMAN WITH INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY 2' TO LEFT MTS VS
MULTIFOCAL.  PT STATES WAS STARTED ON ONFI 6/2/16 AND HASN'T HAD ANY SZS SINCE
THEN PRIOR TO THAT WAS HAVING 1-2 SZ A DY.





MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

oxcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 600 mg tablet, Take 1.5 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.

zonisamide (ZONEGRAN) 100 mg capsule, Take three bid


clobazam (ONFI) 10 mg Tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth 2 times daily.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:




A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG HV, and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a disorganized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) of 7.5 Hertz.



Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal regions during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:





1. Independent bilateral midtemporal focal slow waves


2. Moderate diffuse slow waves

3. Excess beta



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
midtemporal regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific. In addition there is diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
