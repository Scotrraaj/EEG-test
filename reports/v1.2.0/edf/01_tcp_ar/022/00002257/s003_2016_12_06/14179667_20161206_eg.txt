HISTORY:

44 y.o.  MALE WITH A HX OF NEONATAL MENINGITIS RESULTING IN
ENCEPHELOMALACIA OF THE RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE AND A SEIZURE HISTORY. LAST
SEIZURE WAS 15 YRS AGO.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


lamoTRIgine (LAMICTAL) 200 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily.

carBAMazepine (CARBATROL) 300 mg 12 hr capsule, Take 2 capsules by mouth 2 times daily. He
takes 2 300 mg tabs twice daily


olanzapine (ZYPREXA) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily.

simvastatin (ZOCOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth nightly.

calcium-vitamin D (OSCAL) 250 (625)-125 mg-unit per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.






SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKGand photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
