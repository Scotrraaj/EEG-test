HISTORY:

52 y.o. male with a history of post-traumatic epilepsy, presenting with increase in
seizures and headaches, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

weeks, then RTC & we will adjust the carbamazepine as we increase Aptiom


eslicarbazepine (APTIOM) 400 mg Tablet tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth daily. One at bed- use
coupon

CRESTOR 5 mg tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth once daily

silodosin (RAPAFLO) 8 mg Capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.

carBAMazepine (CARBATROL) 300 mg 12 hr capsule, take 1 capsule by mouth twice a day

daily.
multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


Cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12) 500 mcg Tab, Take  by mouth daily.

calcium carbonate 500 mg (1,250 mg) capsule, Take 1,250 mg by mouth 2 times daily (with meals).



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present. Please note there is continuous vertical and lateral eye movement
present in this study.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:




There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of the presence of a mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.


If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
