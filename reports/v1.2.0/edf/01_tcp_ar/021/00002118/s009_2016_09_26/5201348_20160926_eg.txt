CAUSING LOCALIZATION RELATED EPILEPSY.


PMHX:HTN, HLD, PAD, DEMENTIA

naproxen (NAPROSYN) tablet 500 mg


topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 25 mg



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal (left more than
right) region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
focal slowing in the temporal region



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.






EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:



1. Intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal (left more than right) region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
anterior temporal (left more than right) region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
