HISTORY:

This is a 74 y.o. Woman with recurrent events.




Seizure type 1: Fear, Tongue numbness, especially on the right side, so that she frequently bites her
tongue. The numbness stays for a few minutes and then goes away.



Type 2: Event as described above followed by secondary generalized tonic clonic seizure. She has
not had it for many years.




Per the records she was hospitalized in the EMU for seizure characterization in 2011 but there were
no seizures that were captured during the hospitalization. She had one nonepileptic event that time.




Prior AED: dilantin, phenobarbital, keppra, tegretol, depakote -stopped because she continued to
have seizures.






Last MRI: 11/2008:

1. Findings compatible with right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis, not significantly changed since the
prior study 9/12/06. (this is questionable by my review)


2. Mild-to-moderate small vessel ischemic changes.



Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.






The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION: None


DAY 1 (09/26/16 at 15:20 - 9/27/2016, 08:00)



BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present at times, but
sometimes excess theta is noted.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is not captured


Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal (left more than
right) region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):



None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



DAY 1

IMPRESSION:

1. Intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal (left more than right) region



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
anterior temporal (left more than right) region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.



-----------------------------------------------------------------

DAY  3 (09/28/16 at 08:00 - 9/29/2016, 11:19)


BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a poorly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present at times, but

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES are not performed.



EVENTS:

At 9:22AM while being tested by a medical student the patient suddenly stops responding, closes her
eye and her arms becomes stiff while slumping over to the right. She is placed on her right side in
the bed and exhibits small bilateral intermittent irregular arm twitching. She appears to be
unresponsive and about minute late she starts crying and slowly becomes more responsive.  This
episode lasted ~ 3min.





There is no EEG correlate to this behavior.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


DAY 3


IMPRESSION:

1. Intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal (left more than right) region.

2. One single episode of unresponsiveness with no EEG correlate.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
anterior temporal (left more than right) region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. The episode described above had no EEG correlate
as such it is most consistent with a psychogenic non-epileptic event.

Summary:

INDUCTION PROCEDURES:

None



SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:


Interictal Findings:

Intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal (left more than right) region.


Ictal Findings:


The patient had 1 clinical event while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the
epilepsy monitoring unit with no EEG correlate.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. One pseudoseizure



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:

1. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) and possible controlled localization related epilepsy
(typical event not captured)



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 3 days with continuous video EEG.
This was an succesful  EMU monitoring session because of capturing an event.



The interictal EEG is characterized by Intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal
(left more than right) region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific. The episode described above had no EEG correlate as such it is most
consistent with a psychogenic non-epileptic event.




The patient was weaned off topamax over the course of her admission. She was not restarted on her
medication prior to her discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes were made during
the hospitalization.




The patient had a discussion about her events.  We recommend that he/she to see
a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying psychopathology and diagnosis.




Patient is follow-up with at the Temple Epilepsy Center as an outpatient.
