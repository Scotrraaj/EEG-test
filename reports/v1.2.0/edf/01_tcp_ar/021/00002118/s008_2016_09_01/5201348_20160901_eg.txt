DATE OF STUDY: 09/01/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep




HISTORY:

a 74 y.o. female with a history of  Epilepsy referred for routine EEG for evaluation
of paroxysmal events.  Although she had an EEG in May, insurance requires a second before EMU


Seizure type 1:fear, Tongue numbness, especially on the right side, so that she frequently bites her
tongue. The numbness stays for a few minutes and then goes away.


Type 2: Event as described above followed by secondary generalized tonic clonic seizure. She has
not had it for many years.MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 50 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily for 360 days.

OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 600 mg tablet, TAKE 3 TABLETS BY MOUTH 2 TIMES DAILY.


CALCIUM CARBONATE/VITAMIN D2 (OYSTER SHELL CALCIUM WITH D PO), Take  by mouth.

valsartan (DIOVAN) 320 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily for 360 days.

donepezil (ARICEPT) 5 mg tablet, TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH AT BEDTIME FOR MEMORY


naproxen (NAPROSYN) 375 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily as needed (pain).

hydrochlorothiazide (MICROZIDE) 12.5 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily for 360 days. For
blood pressure






TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7.8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There is
excess theta in wakefulness




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes, POSTS. There are shifting asymmetries in sleep with asynchronous
vertex waves and K complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




Mild  generalized slowing is present.

Shifting slowing is present in sleep.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness noted over the temporal regions

Hypnogogic hypersynchrony was seen



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mildly slow and disorganized pattern



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are frequently found in association with epilepsy, dementia, and many other
disorders. No epileptiform features were seen.
