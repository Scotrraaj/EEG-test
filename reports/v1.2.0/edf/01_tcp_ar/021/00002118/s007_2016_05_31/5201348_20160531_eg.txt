HISTORY:

74 y.o. female with a history of MESIAL TEMPORAL SCLEROSIS CAUSING
LOCALIZATION RELATED EPILEPSY. S/P FALL ON SEPTA-HIT R-SIDE OF HEAD WITH LEGS
SHAKING.

PMHX:HTN, HLD, PAD, DEMENTIA referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS: OXCARBAZEPINE, VALSARTAN, CILOSTAZOL, AMLODIPINE, DONEPEZIL


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically challenging
record due to abundant muscle artifact affecting the bilateral frontotemporal regions. The study
included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and excess beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm

(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and bursts of theta slowing as well as diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and
produces no definite effect, though this interpretation of this portion of the study is limited by muscle
artifact.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Occasional PVC's are noted.



IMPRESSION:

This is an normal, though technically limited awake and asleep routine EEG.


Excess beta frequencies are noted.

Occasional PVC's are noted on a single EKG lead.




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.


Excess beta frequencies may be seen in the setting of a medication effect (such as benzodiazepines
or barbiturates).


Occasional PVC's are noted on a single EKG lead.
