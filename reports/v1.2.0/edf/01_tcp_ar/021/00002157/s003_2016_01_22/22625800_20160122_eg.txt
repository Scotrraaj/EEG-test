START DATE OF STUDY: 01/22/2016 at 21:30 END DATE OF STUDY: 01/25/2016 at 6:00AM  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 58 y.o. female with a history of seizures and recent change in mental status referred for continuous videoEEG for treatment of status epilepticus.  MEDICATIONS: Current Outpatient Prescriptions: levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL XR) 200 mg 12 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. clonazePAM (KLONOPIN) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 0.5 mg by mouth See Admin Instructions. Pt. Only takes when she feels a seizure coming on clonazePAM (KLONOPIN) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly as needed for Anxiety.  SEDATION: lorazepam and lorazepam drip  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (01/22/2016, 21:30 - 1/26/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.  The background is reactive, but variable.  There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Sleep was not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Rare (<1hour) rare right temporal spikes were noted.  EVENTS: As the record opens at 9:26PM, the patient is having a clinical seizure consisting of high-amplitude, sharply contoured left fronto-temporal theta activity. The right hemisphere has some field spread and shows predominantly theta. The patient is tachycardic. The seizure lasts for approximately 3 minutes and post-ictally there is diffuse theta and delta slowing. A second seizure then occurs at 9:37PM in which the patient cries out, and is confused. The elctrographic pattern is the same and lasts for approximately 3 minutes. Similar events occur at 9:47PM and 10:11 PM. The patient is given lorazepam 3mg iv.  After the lorazepam, the seizure frequency diminishes and no further clinical seizures are seen until 2:17AM and 2:39AM on 1/23/16.  The waking backgroundat this time is continuous, symmetric, and moderately well-organized, with diffuse low amplitude beta activity. and consists predominantly of  with admixed theta. Of note intermittent brief (<30 seconds) left temporal electrographic seizures were noted e.g., 10:53 PM, 1:03AM, throughout the night.  EKG: A single lead captured sinus tachycardia.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an ABNORMAL 15 hour videoEEG due to status epilepticus, left fronto-temporal onset. Ongoing treatment plan discussed with primary team.  Reading attending:   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (01/23/2016, 06:00 - 1/24/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: There is nearly continuous low voltage beta activity that is symmetric.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: None  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: Left fronto-temporal onset seizures noted at 7:52AM, 9:48AM, 11:45AM. The patient was loaded with phenobarbital and placed on a lorazepam drip.  EKG: A single EKG lead captured sinus rhythm.  DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  This is an ABNORMAL 24 hour videoEEG due to several left frontotemporal complex partial seizures and resolving left fronto-temporal status epilepticus. These findings were communicated to the primary team.  Reading attending:   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 3 (01/24/2016, 06:00 - 1/25/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: There is more variability to the tracing with the appearance of some sleep activity and a fragmentary posterior dominant rhythm. Beta activity however is the predominant waveform.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: None  FOCAL SLOWING: None  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: None  EKG: A single EKG lead captured sinus rhythm.  DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  This is a mildly ABNORMAL 24 hour videoEEG due to diffuse low voltage beta activity. No further seizures were identified. These findings were communicated to the primary team.  Reading attending:    -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 4 (01/25/2016, 06:00 - 1/26/2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: Diffuse low amplitude beta activity.There is more variability to the tracing with the appearance of some sleep activity and a fragmentary posterior dominant rhythm.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: None  FOCAL SLOWING: Rare left frontotemporal slowing, theta/delta.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: None  EKG: A single EKG lead captured sinus rhythm.  DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  This is a mildly ABNORMAL 24 hour videoEEG due to diffuse low voltage beta activity  and focal left frontotemporal slowing. No further seizures were identified. These findings were communicated to the primary team.  Reading attending:   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 5 (01/26/2016, 06:00 - 1/26/2016, 2:00PM)  BACKGROUND: There is overall less beta activity and now the appearance of a fragmentary posterior dominant rhythm.  GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change  FOCAL SLOWING: Intermittent focal slowing in the theta and delta range over the left frontotemporal region.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: None  EKG: A single EKG lead captured sinus rhythm   DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  This is a mildly ABNORMAL 8 hour videoEEG due to diffuse low voltage beta activity and focal left frontotemporal slowing. No further seizures were identified. These findings were communicated to the primary team.  Reading attending:
