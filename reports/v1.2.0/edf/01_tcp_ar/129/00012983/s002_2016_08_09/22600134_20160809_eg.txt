TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present. There is frequent vertical and lateral
eye movement artifact throughout the study.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:






Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with fair cooperation and produces
mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only  routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
