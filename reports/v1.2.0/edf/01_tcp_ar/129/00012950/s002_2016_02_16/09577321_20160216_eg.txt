HISTORY:

70 y.o. female with a history of LEFT LEG

SHAKING X3. NO HX OF SZ. PMHX: COPD, HTN, DM, RIGHT FRONTAL BRAIN


TUMOR PER FAMILY. PT HAD CRANIOTOMY (RIGHT FRONTAL).


MEDICATIONS: none listed



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically suboptimal record due to

near continuous muscle artifact affecting the

frontocentrotemporal leads. The study included a single channel


of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is difficult to completely assess due to

near continuous diffuse (frontocentrotemporally-predominant)


muscle artifact. During periods of relative relaxation, the

background consists of at least fairly organized low voltage fast

frequencies. There is continuous right fronto-temporal

polymorphic slowing, higher in amplitude than the remaining


background.



Drowsiness and sleep is not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal, though technically limited, awake only


routine EEG due to:

1. Continuous right fronto-temporal polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of right fronto-temporal

dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.
