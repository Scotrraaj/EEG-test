HISTORY:

24 y.o. female with a history of 2 witnessed seizures referred for routine
EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS: Keppra



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and excess beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.






During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.




Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex
waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

Occasional right posterior quadrant polymorphic slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Occasional right posterior quadrant polymorphic slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of right posterior quadrant dysfunction. Excess
beta may be seen in the setting of certain medications (i.e., benzodiazepines or barbiturates).
