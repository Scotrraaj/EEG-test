HISTORY: 56 y.o. MALE ADMITTED ON 2-16 FOR RIGHT TEMPORAL ICH. PT WAS FOUND DOWN BY ROOMMATE AT RECOVERY HOUSE, WAS UNRESPONSIVE AND WITH INCOTINENCE. FRIEND SAYS PT WAS NORMAL THE NIGHT BEFORE. PT WAS INTUBATED AND HAD RIGHT CRANIOTOMY FOR ICH EVACUATION CURRENTLY HAS EVD. PMHX. ETOH ABUSE. 60 CM HEAD  MEDICATIONS: Keppra PB  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG    DAY 1 (2/18/2016, 4:57PM - 2/19/2016, 06:00AM)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, poorly-organized, and consists predominantly of delta with admixed theta.  Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.  Sleep was not captured.  Continuous right frontal polymorphic delta and attenuation is seen.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Frequent right frontal sharp waves at times quasi periodic.  Multiple frequent electrographic seizures were seen per hour. They consist of rhythmic fronto-central sharp waves that increase in frequency and amplitude. At times they can be preceded or evolve into a beta discharge than then slows down to a theta discharge later again becoming rhythmic sharp waves. The onset and end is not  always clearly evident as it may merge with the quasi periodic frequent right frontal sharp waves.   The seizures last ~ 1 minute and no clinical correlate is seen on video.  Despite medication this seizures remain frequent through the entire day 1 record.  EVENTS: No clinical events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a HR of ~ 66BPM  DAY 1 IMPRESSION  1. Right fronto-central electrographic status epilepticus 2. Right frontal sharp waves  3. Right frontal continuous focal slow and attenuation 4. Moderate diffuse slow.  ----------------------------------------------------------- DAY 2 (2/19/2016, 06:00AM - 2/20/2016, 10:23AM)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, poorly-organized, and consists predominantly of delta with admixed theta.  Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.  Sleep was not captured.  Continuous right frontal polymorphic delta and attenuation is seen.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  Multiple frequent electrographic seizures were seen per hour. They consist of rhythmic fronto-central sharp waves that increase in frequency and amplitude. At times they can be preceded or evolve into a beta discharge than then slows down to a theta discharge later again becoming rhythmic sharp waves. The onset and end is not  always clearly evident as it may merge with the quasi periodic frequent right frontal sharp waves.  The seizures last ~ 1 minute and no clinical correlate is seen on video.  Around 2 PM the seizures start becoming less frequent and by 3PM can only be seen once per hour. Last seizure was seen ~ 5:30PM.  EVENTS: No clinical events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a HR of ~ 66BPM  DAY 2 IMPRESSION  1. Right fronto-central electrographic status epilepticus until 5:30PM 2. Right frontal sharp waves  3. Right frontal continuous focal slow and attenuation 4. Moderate diffuse slow.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This 38hrs LTM EEG revealed right fronto central electrographic status epilepticus which resolved and right frontal sharp waves. This is consistent with a irritable epileptogenic focus in that region. The continuous right frontal focal slowing is consistent with the known ICH and craniotomy. Lastly the moderated diffuse slow is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology.
