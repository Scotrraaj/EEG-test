HISTORY:

54 y.o. male with a history of right MCA stroke referred for routine EEG for
screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg

famotidine (PEPCID) tablet 20 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

aspirin (BAYER) tablet 325 mg

magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL


heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 20 mg

levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 50 mcg

dextrose 50% injection 50 mL



glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units


insulin glargine (LANTUS) injection 10 Units

insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 5 Units


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background demonstrates low to medium voltage 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR), somewhat better developed on the left. Low-voltage anteriorly predominant 18-30 Hz activity
was also seen. A moderate amount of low and low to medium amplitude irregular 3-7 Hz activity was
present over the right frontotemporal regions.




During drowsiness, amplitude attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm along
with diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:



A heart rate of 86 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild asymmetry of dominant posterior rhythm which was somewhat better developed on the left.

2. Right frontotemporal irregular slowing.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate a mild right hemispheric functional disturbance consistent with the clinical
diagnosis of right MCA stroke. No clinical or electrographic seizure activity and no paroxysmal
epileptiform discharges were recorded.
