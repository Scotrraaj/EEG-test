HISTORY:

65 y.o. female with a history of anoxic brain injury who remains unresponsive.

SEDATION: fentanyl



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

There is no PDR or AP gradient.



The background is attenuated and consists of slow non-reactive delta activity.




No normal sleep architecture is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.





Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 120 bpm with premature QRS complexes is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal comatose 21 minute routine EEG due to:

1. Marked background slowing

2. Lack of reactivity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is etiologically nonspecific.  In a
post-anoxic nonsedated patient this EEG pattern suggests poor chance of meaningful neurological
recovery.
