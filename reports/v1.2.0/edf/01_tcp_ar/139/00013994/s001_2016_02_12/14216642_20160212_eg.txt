HISTORY:

64 y.o. female with a history of seizures

referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Xanax




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a

fairly organized symmetric mixture of sharply contoured alpha and


excess beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8 Hertz

posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior


gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.


Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

1. Occasional sharp waves are noted over the left temporal


region, likely a benign variant (wicket waves)


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings indicate the presence of mild diffuse cerebral

dysfunction.


Occasional sharp waves noted over the left temporal region likely

represent wicket waves, a benign variant.

If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.

Excess of beta frequencies can be seen in the setting of a


medication effect (benzodiazepines).
