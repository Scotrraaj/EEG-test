HISTORY:

38 y.o. WOMAN WITH PROGRESSIVE AMS, AND

LETHARGY. PMHX. DM, CAD, CVA, VISUALLY IMPARIED,SQUAMOUS CANCER,


STAGE 4 KIDNEY DISEASE. 52 CM HEAD.


MEDICATIONS:


METOPROLOL, KAYEXALATE, HEPARIN, LASIX.


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


characterized by disorganized diffuse high voltage delta and

theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior


gradient of frequencies.


Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology

are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms


demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.



Sleep is not captured


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation

are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Triphasic waves

2. Diffuse slow waves, moderate to severe



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to frequent

frontally-maximal triphasic waves and moderate to severe diffuse


background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe

diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but


suggestive of a metabolic origin.
