DATE OF STUDY: 05/13/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

 a 62 y.o. male with a history of seizures and a prior TBI.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. 1/2 100 mg BID.


tiotropium (SPIRIVA) 18 mcg inhalation capsule, Inhale 1 capsule into the lungs daily.

levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:







A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5-9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured




Continuous bilateral polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the anterior quadrants.
Additional low amplitude fast activity is seen over the Cz/ Pz leads and right frontocentral region
(max over C4).



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.






IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and briefly drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Continuous mild-to-moderate focal slowing over the bilateral anterior quadrants.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the bilateral anterior quadrants.


Breach effect is secondary to the skull defect.



No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
