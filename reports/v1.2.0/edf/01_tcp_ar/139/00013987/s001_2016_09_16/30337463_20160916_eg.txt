DATE OF STUDY: 09/16/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 40 y.o. female with a history of GSW to head, seizure 9 months ago, H/A
referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

VENTOLIN HFA 90 mcg/actuation inhaler,

amoxicillin (AMOXIL) 500 mg capsule,


SYMBICORT 160-4.5 mcg/actuation inhaler,

UNKNOWN TO PATIENT,



No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None




TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  There was a great deal of muscle
artifact noted, the patient could not relax but did fall asleep. There is an apparent breach but no
mention of cranial deformity.





EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is greatly obscured by muscle but there is an organized symmetric mixture of
theta, alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is a
suggestion of focal slowing on left





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. Left temporal focal slow and breach
emerge



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. There are asymmetries and likely F7 F1 sharps Slow wave sleep was
not captured.




Mild generalized slowing is present.

Left focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

likely F7 F1 sharps

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Challenging study but clear left temporal focal slowing and likely sharp waves in sleep.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings  Are supportive of localization related mechanism for epilepsy
