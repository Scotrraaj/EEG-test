DATE OF STUDY: 05/14/16 to 05/16/2016 48 hour

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU




HISTORY:

a 22 y.o. male with a history of  2 sequential traumas.  He was stabbed, and in
route to the hospital had a motor vehicle accident.  He was sedated overnight, but, when sedation
was stopped, he had prolonged focal shaking of the right arm without impairment of awareness
referred for LTM EEG for characterization of seizures and management of ongoing ictal activity.




MEDICATIONS:

Dilantin, fosphenytoin,  MORPHINE


SEDATION: ATIVAN

TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with
T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  challenging record and
included a single channel of EKG.  the patient was awake, he was removing his EEG electrodes.  In
addition, the patient was coherent and able to indicate his unwillingness to continue EEG
monitoring on the 16th

DAY 1 (05/14/16 at 2:48 PM,  - 5/15/2016, 06:00)

MEDICATIONS:

Dilantin, fosphenytoin,  MORPHINE



BACKGROUND:

This is a dynamic background in a patient who is just received additional medications.  The overall
pattern is motor medium amplitude, diffusely slow with diffuse beta.  There is a blunted sharp wave
identified in the occipital region.  Stimulation of the patient closely produces an alerting with alpha
frequency activity present bilaterally.  By 10 PM, he is removed the occipital electrodes



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Slow, blunted, left occipital delta is noted early in the record, not identified as the afternoon
continues

EVENTS: No additional episodes of right arm jerking were noted although the patient was noted to
have weakness in the right arm


No electrographic seizures were recorded EKG: A single lead captured  HR 80-104


DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


The pattern described above is compatible with a subclinical status epilepticus with ongoing
epileptiform activity but without clinical correlate, aside from the arm weakness.  The patient was
examined and was found to have an improving mental status, and increasingly awake which enabled
him to remove his electrodes and voicing his discomfort about the procedure.

DAY 2 (05/15/16 at 6 AM,  - 5/16/2016,  @PM)


TECHNIQUE:

The patient removed his EEG electrodes repeatedly.  Substantial portions of the last day include
artifact.  By the time now acceptable EEG is recorded, it is 12 PM  on the 15th and the patient had
received an additional 500 mg of phenytoin


BACKGROUND:


This is a dynamic background in a patient who is just received sedation.  It starts out with generalized
background slowing.  As the patient awakens, there is more of a beta pattern with a glimpse of an
alpha rhythm on the right.




The left hemisphere demonstrates focal slowing in the left posterior quadrant with ongoing sharp
waves.  Early on, there is also some slowing in the right posterior quadrant.  As the record continues,
the patient is increasingly awake and there is generous beta in the right hemisphere is better
organized



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

There is subtle, blunted delta in the left occipital region but no additional sharp waves, spikes or
clear ictal discharges were identified


EVENTS: No additional episodes of right arm jerking were noted although the patient was noted to
have weakness in the right arm



EKG: A single lead captured  HR 80-104


DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

The pattern described above is compatible with a subclinical status epilepticus with ongoing
epileptiform activity but without clinical correlate, aside from the arm weakness.  The patient was
examined and was found to have an improving mental status, and increasingly awake which enabled
him to remove his electrodes and voicing his discomfort about the procedure.





---------------------------------------------------------------



FINAL IMPRESSION:



This is abnormal video EEG due to:


1. initially electrographic status epilepticus pattern with ongoing epileptiform activity in the left
occipital region


2.  Generalized background slowing, improving and then reappearing during the time period when
the patient had an elevated phenytoin level.


3. intermittent focal slowing, less remarkable near the end of the record

FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings support a structural process or an acute process in the left hemisphere.  Although the
patient's cooperativity was a challenge, the seizures resolved at some point when the EEG was
completely uninterpretable due to to the removal of scalp electrodes
