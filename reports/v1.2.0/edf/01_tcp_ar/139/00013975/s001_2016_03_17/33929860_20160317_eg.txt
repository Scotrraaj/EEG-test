SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and


photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

Patient is only very briefly awake.  The posterior dominant


rhythm consists of low amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity with

expected AP (anterior-to-posterior) gradient.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes.


Patient is asleep throughout most of the recording.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~56 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

Sleep II

No epileptiform discharges






CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal very briefly awake and mostly asleep 23-minute

routine EEG.



A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of


epilepsy.


A heart rate of ~56 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
