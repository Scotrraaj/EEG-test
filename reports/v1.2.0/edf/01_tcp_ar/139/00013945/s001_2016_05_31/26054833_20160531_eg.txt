HISTORY: 63 y.o. male with a history of pulmonary thromboembolism referred for EEG monitoring during pulmonary thromboembolectomy.  MEDICATIONS: ISOFLURANE, SOLU MEDROL, HEPARIN, PRECEDEX   SEDATION: isoflurane, flurane  INDUCTION MEDS:  ETOMIDATE, FENTANYL, MIDAZOLAM, LIDOCAINE, ROCURONIUM.      TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in the operating room (OR) using the International 10-20 system and utilized a NicOne system.  This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  The recording begins with the patient awake in the OR and continues through sedation, hypothermia and then rewarming.  The study was monitored 1:1 with online remote neurophysiologist review, for 4 hours and 53 minutes.  A technician was available in the OR throughout the study.  The use of sedative medications was documented by the technician, in communication with the anesthetist, throughout the study.    EEG BACKGROUND: The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   Cooling begins at 09:04.  With anesthesia and cooling the background rapidly becomes slower, consisting of a disorganized mixture of theta and delta frequencies, and lower in amplitude. As the study progresses the background becomes intermittently attenuated, then it develops a symmetric burst-suppression pattern with some intermittent low amplitude diffuse sharp waves, then very brief runs of generalized periodic discharges. This continues until there is complete suppression.  Complete suppression occurred at 09:45. This was communicated to the team.   Rewarming began at 10:46.  During re-warming, the background at first is characterized by burst suppression, with frequent bilateral fronto-temporal sharp waves and spikes.  This is communicated to the team.  The background slowly becomes more continuous and consists of mainly diffuse symmetric theta and delta activity, with increasingly rare bilateral fronto-temporal sharp waves.  This is communicated to the team.  No focal slowing is present.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: See above under "background."  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS:  There are no clinical or electrographic events, other than as documented above, captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate in the 60s-70s is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: No seizures were seen.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an uneventful intraoperative 4 hour and 53 min EEG during cardiopulmonary surgery with hypothermia. All changes were communicated to the primary team.  INCISION: 08:39 HEPARIN: 08:53, 25000 UNITS BYPASS: 09:04 COOLING: 09:04 SUPPRESSION: 09:45 CROSS CLAMPED: 09:47 CARDIAC ARREST: 09:57 CIRCULATORY ARREST: 09:57, 10:29 REPERFUSION: 10:18, 10:44 REWARMING: 10:48
