DATE OF STUDY: 04/27/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 46 y.o. male with a history of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Neurontin, Baclofen




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background consists of 9-10 Hz polymorphic alpha activity, poor AP (anterior-to-posterior)
gradient and excess diffuse polymorphic theta activity.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with fair cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

Mild diffuse slowing and disorganization


Sleep stage II

No epileptiform discharges




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep 27-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
disorganization.




These finding are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.



The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
