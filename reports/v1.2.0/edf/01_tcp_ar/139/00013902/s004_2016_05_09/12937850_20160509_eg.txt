HISTORY:

This is a 62 y.o. right handed female admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG)
monitoring with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology. She has had previous EEGs and
EEG  monitoring for nonepileptic seizures, but has had some events with falling.





Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Evaluation of paroxysmal events.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;




- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patient's exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is
not a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9, T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The spike and seizure detection computer program  was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SEDATION:  None



DAY 1 (May 9, 2016 - 5/10/2016, 06:00)



BACKGROUND:


The waking background is  continuous,  symmetric,  well-organized, and consists predominantly of
alpha frequency activity with low voltage frontocentral beta




Posterior dominant rhythm was present, 9 Hz, 30 ÂµV.


The background is  reactive,  variable.



There were  no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was characterized by  symmetric sleep spindles and/or K-complexes.


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present

EKG: HR 72 BPM Reg


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:none

EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Normal awake and asleep EEG

DAY 2 (May 10, 2016, 06:00 - 5/11/2016, 06:00)

INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:



The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reaches  9.5 Hz.Lambda was noted



Sleep is characterized by vertex waves K complexes spindles and POSTS

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None

The patient was noted to be very sleepy during the day, frequently napping.  The nurses had a hard
time getting her to sleep deprive.  She was encouraged to bicycle.

The bilateral posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reaches  9.5 Hz.  Lambda was noted

There was one  electrographic events captured during this study.


May 12, 3:02 AM

Although the technologist and the nurse were within visualization of the patient, when the team left
the direct vision of the patient, the patient went to the bathroom on escorted and closed the door.
Her resting heart rate is 96 weeks per minute as she gets up.  The team can hearing that she is in the
bathroom and that she fell.  The patient is off camera entirely for the event.




The EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm in the maximum heart
rate of 132 BPM.


The EEG monitoring team observed and documented generalized shaking of all of her extremities at
the same time that the patient had a normal awake EEG.  She was considered to be responsive to
the nurses during the period of generalized shaking and was able to answer questions and recall a
code word.  Total event duration 3 minutes.




Orthostatic vital signs were performed after the event.  The patient was not orthostatic.

EKG: A single lead captured HR 96-120 BPM

None

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

dominant rhythm,  without any focal findings  or epileptiform discharges.




ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any clinical events.

The patient did have a single event, off camera without any epileptiform activity, similar to
previously described non-epileptic seizures.


SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Pseudoseizure, associated with tachycardia, but no evidence of hypotension or impairment of
awareness

1. pseudoseizure



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 3.5days with continuous video EEG.
This was an elective EMU monitoring session to makesure she was not having epileptiform activity.



The interictal EEG is characterized by  normal, posterior dominant rhythm.



The patient was weaned off Trileptal over the course of  The admission. No other medication
