DATE OF STUDY: 04/08/2016

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep





HISTORY:

a 77 y.o. male with a history of respiratory

distress, who is currently sedated on propofol.  Patient has


episodes concerning for seizures.


MEDICATIONS:


Propofol




SEDATION: propofol, turned off ~ 5 minutes into the recording.


TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.








EEG BACKGROUND:


Early in the recording (with propofol on), the background

consists of attenuated fast activity admixed with occasional

periods of the background discontinuity.



Once propofol is turned off and the patient is stimulated, the

background changes: voltages increase, there is increase in the


amount of theta and delta activity.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not

performed.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of ~63 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

Diffuse slowing - moderate


Sedated recording

No electrographic seizures



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal 24-minute portable EEG due to moderate

diffuse slowing.

This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral

dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but in this


case, is at least partially related to the medication effect.
