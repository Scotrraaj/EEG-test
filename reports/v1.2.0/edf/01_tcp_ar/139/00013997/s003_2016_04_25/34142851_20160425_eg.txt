RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: 

EEG TYPE: Long term recording





HISTORY:

This is a 28 y.o. right handed female undergoing continuous inpatient video-
electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring, after being admitted via the ER, with a history of: focal
seizures with dyscognitive features.





Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Characterization of seizures.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;




- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patientÂ’s exam


(9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is
not a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9, T2, F10, T10, and P10 electrodes were placed in this patient.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.






Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For approximately 8 hours each day the
patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24
hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with
special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a technician was not
available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed
seizure testing and electrode maintenance.





The Gotman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used
to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG
were recorded periodically.  Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events
and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.




MEDICATIONS:


Keppra 1500 mg q12h

Vimpat 200 mg q12h



SEDATION: None


DAY 1 (4/25/2016, 15:45 - 4/26/2016, 06:00)



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha, theta, and delta frequencies, with a 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) at best. The
normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.


Diffuse, frontally predominant beta is also seen.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric high amplitude vertex
waves and sleep spindles. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



There is mild to moderate generalized slowing.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 86 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.

DAY 2 (4/26/2016, 06:00 - 4/26/2016, 10:12)



AEDs: unchanged



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND: unchanged



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 90s.



DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

No change compared with day 1


Reading attending: 






-----------------------------------------------------------------


FINAL IMPRESSION:



This is an abnormal video EEG due to:



1. Mild to moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization




FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.



Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.


This EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
