HISTORY:

34 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy and developmental delay, seizure free
x15 years, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


carBAMazepine (TEGRETOL) 200 mg tablet, Take 200 mg by mouth daily (with breakfast).
Indications: TONIC-CLONIC EPILEPSY



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically difficult record as
patient resistant during the hook-up; tech notes impedances were < 10 kOhm. The study included a
single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. A single burst of frontally predominant diffuse irregular 3 Hz polyspike and wave occurs out of
wakefulness and lasts <2 seconds.


There is no definite clinical correlate and burst does not last long enough for patient to be tested
during it.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with poor cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to:

1. A single burst of frontally predominant diffuse irregular 3 Hz polyspike and wave



CLINICAL CORRELATION:




These findings indicate the presence of a generalized epileptogenic process; however, a frontal
focus with rapid secondary bisynchrony cannot entirely be excluded.
