HISTORY:

57 y.o. female with a history of anxiety, bipolar

disorder, and seizures for 10 years, now presenting with seizures


(GTC with LOC) after being seizure-free for 2 years. She had

stopped taking Depakote referred for routine EEG for

characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS: METHADONE, DEPAKOTE, XANAX, AMBIEN PRN, SEROQUEL



SEDATION: as above


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.


Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

There is frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing.


There is occasional independent right temporal polymorphic

slowing.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric

background slowing.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which

is a normal finding.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:


1. Frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing.

2. Occasional independent right temporal polymorphic slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of bitemporal (left > right)

cerebral dysfunction.
