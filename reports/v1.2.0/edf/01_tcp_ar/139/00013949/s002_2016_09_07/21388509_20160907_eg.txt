DATE OF STUDY: 09/07/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 60 min - 3 hr, awake and drowsy



HISTORY:

a 68 y.o. male with a history of hypertension, CAD, cocaine abuse, found
unresponsive, referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

isosorbide mononitrate (IMDUR) 24 hr tablet 30 mg

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) tablet 20 mg


amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

niCARdipine (CARDENE) 20 mg in NaCl (iso-os) 200 mL infusion


valproate (DEPACON) 500 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

aspirin EC tablet 81 mg


clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg



sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg


heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion


aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The resting background demonstrates a large amount of low amplitude 18-25 Hz activity with
significant amounts of superimposed muscle, movement, eye blink and prominent EKG artifact.
Moderate amounts of irregular low to medium and medium amplitude 4-7 Hz activity were seen
predominantly over the central and temporal regions. Mild amplitude asymmetry was noted with
higher amplitudes on the left. At times, there also appeared to be some suppression of faster
frequency activity over the right hemisphere. Frequent higher amplitude slowing and intermixed
sharp waves were seen over the left temporal region at F7-T3.





During drowsiness, amplitude attenuation and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) left temporal sharp and slow activity was seen as detailed above.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:


EKG monitor demonstrated sinus rhythm at 84



Minute with STÂ–T wave abnormalities.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG due to:


1. Diffuse background slowing and disorganization

2. Intermittent amplitude asymmetry with diminished amplitude and occasional suppression of faster
frequency activity over the right hemisphere


3. Frequent sharp and slow discharges over the left mid to anterior temporal region.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate a bihemispheric functional disturbance with focal irritative activity over the
left temporal region. No clinical or electrographic seizures were recorded.
