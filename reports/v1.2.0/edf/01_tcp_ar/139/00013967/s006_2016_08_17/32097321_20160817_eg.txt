HISTORY:

67 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy who presented with multiple seizures
including right face twitching and left sided weakness.



MEDICATIONS:


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

Facility-Administered Medications Ordered in Other Visits:


pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg

topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 300 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

lacosamide (VIMPAT) tablet 200 mg

levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 88 mcg


furosemide (LASIX) tablet 40 mg

spironolactone (ALDACTONE) tablet 50 mg



atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg

rifaximin (XIFAXAN) tablet 550 mg


lactulose (CHRONULAC) solution 20 g

levETIRAacetam (KEPPRA) 2,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB




TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically limited record
due to almost continuous muscle artifact and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:



The waking background is characterized by the presence of diffuse continuous low amplitude delta
waves, No posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) or normal anterior-to-posterior gradient seen.



Sleep is not captured



Generalized slowing is present.

Continuous focal slowing present on right side.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Nearly continuous electrographic seizures captured which start at P4/C4 and T6 area at 1.5 to 2Hz,
then increases frequency to 3 Hz followed by slowing. There is no spread to left hemisphere.



There is no clinical correlate to these electrical discharges.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are nearly continuous electrographic seizures as described above captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


1. Electrographic status epilepticus arising from the right posterior quadrant.

2. Severe generalized diffuse slow waves.


3. Continuous right posterior quadrant slow waves.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal routine EEG due to electrographic status epilepticus arising from right posterior
quadrant with severe generalized diffuse slow waves.


These findings indicate the presence of acute epileptogenic focus in right posterior quadrant.
