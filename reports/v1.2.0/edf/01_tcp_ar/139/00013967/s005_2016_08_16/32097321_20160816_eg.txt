HISTORY: 67 y.o. female admitted with multiple seizures with right facial twitching and left sided weakness.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 300 mg sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL Lorazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg lacosamide (VIMPAT) tablet 200 mg levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) tablet 88 mcg furosemide (LASIX) tablet 40 mg spironolactone (ALDACTONE) tablet 50 mg atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg rifaximin (XIFAXAN) tablet 550 mg lactulose (CHRONULAC) solution 20 g levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 2,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB   TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (8/16/2016, 19:48 - 8/17/2016, 08:00)  BACKGROUND:  The waking background is characterized by the presence of diffuse continuous low amplitude delta waves, No posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) or normal anterior-to-posterior gradient seen.   Sleep is not captured  Generalized slowing is present.   Continuous focal slowing present on right side.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Continuous electrographic seizures captured which start at P4/C4 and T6 area at 1.5 to 2Hz, then increases frequency to 3 Hz followed by slowing. There is no spread to left hemisphere. At 8:40 PM, the first of four clinical seizures are seen. They appear to electrically spread more towards C4 and a clear myogenic artifact is seen over both hemispheres. These clinical seizures last ~ 2 minutes. During the video, there is intermittent right and left sided muscle twitching seen.  The continuous seizures remain until around 10:20 PM. At this point, the background muscle artifact becomes less prominent, there is diffuse attenuation and the electrographic seizures remain frequent but not continuous until the end of the record.  In between the seizures, there is clear C4/P4 and T6 Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED's) seen.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: There are 4 clinical seizures and frequent electrographic seizures as described above captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:  1. Electrographic status epilepticus arising from the right posterior quadrant with 4 clinical seizures. 2. Severe generalized diffuse slow waves. 3. Continuous right posterior quadrant slow waves.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to electrographic status epilepticus arising from right posterior quadrant with severe generalized diffuse slow waves. These findings indicate the presence of acute epileptogenic focus in right posterior quadrant.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (8/17/2016, 08:00 - 8/18/2016, 12:55pm )  BACKGROUND:  The waking background is characterized by the presence of diffuse continuous low amplitude delta waves, No posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) or normal anterior-to-posterior gradient seen.   Sleep is not captured  Generalized slowing is present.   Continuous focal slowing present on right side.  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Frequent electrographic seizures captured which start at P4/C4 and T6 area at 1.5 to 2Hz, then increases frequency to 3 Hz followed by slowing. There is no spread to left hemisphere. The electrographic seizures remain until about 4PM then Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED's) are seen that slowly increase to 1 Hz  In between the seizures, there is clear C4/P4 and T6 Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED's) seen.  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EVENTS: None clinical events so far.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:  1. Electrographic status epilepticus arising from the right posterior quadrant, improved. 2. Severe generalized diffuse slow waves. 3. Continuous right posterior quadrant slow waves.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to electrographic improved status epilepticus arising from right posterior quadrant with severe generalized diffuse slow waves. These findings indicate the presence of acute epileptogenic focus in right posterior quadrant.
