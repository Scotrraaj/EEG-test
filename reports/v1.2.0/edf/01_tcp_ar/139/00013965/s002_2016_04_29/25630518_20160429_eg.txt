DATE OF STUDY: 04/29/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient (EMU)


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 36 y.o. male admitted for continuous video-electroencephalography (VEEG) monitoring
with a history of: paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.

escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.

clonazePAM (KLONOPIN) 2 mg tablet, Take 2 mg by mouth 2 times daily as needed for Anxiety.


gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 600 mg tablet, Take 600 mg by mouth 3 times daily.

tiotropium (SPIRIVA) 18 mcg inhalation capsule, Inhale 18 mcg into the lungs daily.

oxyCODONE (ROXICODONE) 5 mg immediate release tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth every 4 hours as
needed for Pain.


OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 150 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.



SEDATION: None





TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




BACKGROUND:



The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of low
voltage fast frequencies.



Posterior dominant rhythm consisted of low voltage fast frequencies.



The background is reactive and variable.


There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Drowsiness is characterized by background slowing. Sleep was not captured.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Runs of theta activity, sharply contoured at times, seen over the central regions.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.



Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
The patient complains of dizziness during photic stimulation.



EVENTS: no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



HEART RATE: A heart rate of 90 bpm was captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG. A background consisting of low voltage fast
frequencies can be a normal variant in the adult population.



Excess beta activity can be seen in the setting of a medication effect (i.e., benzodiazepines or
barbiturates).


Runs of midline theta may represent a benign variant.

The patient complained of dizziness during photic stimulation; there were no EEG changes from
background during this time.
