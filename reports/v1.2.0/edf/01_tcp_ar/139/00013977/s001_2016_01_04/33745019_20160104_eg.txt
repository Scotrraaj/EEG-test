HISTORY:

54 y.o. female with a history of episodes


characterized by sitting up, then and complained "head felt

funny." Then stopped talking. Stared without blinking. Arms, legs

were stiff. Unresponsive to examiner. May also have episodes of


shaking during sleep referred for routine EEG for

characterization of seizures.  She has adult onset

hypersomnolence, of unknown etiology, visual impairment,


progressive memory impairment.  Gastric bypass surgery in the

past with low B12, now repleted.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

Lamotrigine (LAMICTAL XR) 50 mg Tablet Extended Rel 24 hr (b),


Take 50 mg by mouth daily. (Patient taking differently: Take 150




mg by mouth daily.)

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2


times daily.

topiramate (TOPAMAX) 50 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times


daily.

Lamotrigine (LAMICTAL XR) 100 mg Tablet Extended Rel 24 hr (b),

Take 100 mg by mouth daily. Start after starter pack is completed



INTRODUCTION: Continuous EEG monitoring was performed in the unit

using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with one


channel EKG.  Seizure and spike detection software was utilized.

A tech was present for ongoing review of the data and seizure

safety.

DAY 1 (1/4/2016 10:00 - 1/5/2016, 06:00)


BACKGROUND: The patient is extremely drowsy but when maximally

awake, there is a 10 Hz, symmetric alpha rhythm.  She is asleep,


in stage II sleep during much of the record with vertex waves, K

complexes spindles and POSTS.  REM sleep was identified.



Abundant lambda and POSTS were seen.  Sometimes, these

morphologies were maximum on the right.



On rare occasions, sleep is a little asymmetric with a little bit

more pain in the right frontal region



GENERALIZED SLOWING: Nonsignificant, likely excessive drowsiness


FOCAL SLOWING: None



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected



EKG: A single EKG lead captured 60




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

No significant epileptiform features.  No seizures were recorded.

BACKGROUND:  The patient is extremely drowsy but when maximally

awake, there is a 10 Hz, symmetric alpha rhythm.  She is asleep,

microsleep

split the vertex wave appearing out of wakefulness.

except

as noted under

-----------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:



INTERICTAL FINDINGS:  The patient's interictal findings consist

of a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, without any focal findings


or epileptiform discharges.  Abundant periods of drowsiness and

sleep are captured.  Occasionally during wakefulness, 1-1.5

second bursts of diffuse sharply contoured alpha and theta are

seen. Unusual sleep patterns were noted with perhaps more alpha


frequency activity in the occipital regions during REM sleep,

noted 4:40 a.m. on the morning of 1/6/2016



ICTAL FINDINGS:

The patient did not have any typical habitual clinical events.

An episode of bradycardia was captured on 1/9, associated with


nausea.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:  No seizures captured



EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:  No seizures captured



CONCLUSION:

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for


7 days with continuous video EEG.  This was an elective EMU

monitoring session for characterization of episodes of shaking

and staring.



The patient was completely weaned off topiramate followed by

lamotrigine over the course of his admission. However, her


typical habitual clinical events were not captured during

admission. Frequent periods of drowsiness and sleep were

captured.  Occasional bursts of diffuse sharply contoured theta

and alpha activity may represent drowsiness, or alternatively may


be a marker of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.



She was restarted on her home dose of Lamictal XR 150 mg qhs

medication on the day prior to his discharge, and on Topamax 50

mg q12h on the day of discharge. No other medication changes were

made during the hospitalization. Of note, she underwent a


cardiology evaluation for the episode of bradycardia on 1/9.



Patient is follow-up at the Temple Epilepsy

Center as an outpatient.
