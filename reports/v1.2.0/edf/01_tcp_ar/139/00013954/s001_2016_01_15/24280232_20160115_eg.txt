HISTORY:

a 66 y.o. female with a history of vertigo with


LOC referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

doxycycline (MONODOX) 100 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth 2

times daily.


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth

daily.

VENTOLIN HFA 90 mcg/actuation inhaler,


methylPREDNIsolone (MEDROL PAK) 4 mg tablet,

Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, (VITAMIN D) 1,000 unit Capsule, Take

1 capsule by mouth daily.


hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by




mouth daily.

folic acid (FOLVITE) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 40 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth 2

times daily.


naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times

daily (with meals).


No current facility-administered medications for this visit.





SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is reasonably symmetric, reactive, and


consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal

beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior


gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and

reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which

attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.

Sleep is not sustained

No generalized slowing is present.

Focal features: intermittent focal slowing is seen, primarily on


the left, in the mid temporal region, wakefulness, photic and

early drowsiness with overlying left temporal wicket.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

wicket



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: not possible



Photic Stimulation: scant driving



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is a mildly abnormal routine EEG for a subject of this age:


Intermittent L temporal focal slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are not uncommon in a subject of this age, but the

left focal temporal theta delta is outside the range of normal.

This may be correlated with imaging and history.  This routine


EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
