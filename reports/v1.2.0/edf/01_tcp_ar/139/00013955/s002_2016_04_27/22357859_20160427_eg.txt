DATE OF STUDY: 04/27/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only





HISTORY:

a 71 y.o. female with a recent history of syncope as well as delirium.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

ALBUTEROL SULFATE (VENTOLIN HFA IN), Inhale  into the lungs.


ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 800 mg tablet, Take 800 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for Pain.

amLODIPine (NORVASC) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily.

lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.


buprenorphine-naloxone (SUBOXONE) 8-2 mg Tablet, Sublingual, Place 1 tablet under the tongue
daily.
naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 6 times daily.

ALPRAZolam (XANAX) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 0.5 mg by mouth nightly as needed.


oxyCODONE-acetaminophen (LYNOX) 10-300 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.

tiotropium (SPIRIVA WITH HANDIHALER) 18 mcg inhalation capsule, Inhale 1,667 capsules into the
lungs daily.


roflumilast (DALIRESP) 500 mcg Tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth daily.




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




Patient is agitated throughout the study, talking, sitting up.


EEG BACKGROUND:


The background consists of 7-8 Hz theta activity posteriorly, poor AP gradient and prominent diffuse
polymorphic theta activity.



Patient remains awake throughout the study.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of ~72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This finding is indicative of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.



No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
