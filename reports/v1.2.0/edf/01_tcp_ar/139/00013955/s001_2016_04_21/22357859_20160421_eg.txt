SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with

T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a

technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of


EKG and verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is disorganized. It includes a symmetric

mixture of theta alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and

reactive *6.5Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal


anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is

present.  FIRDA was noted



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movementsand diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep: Micro-sleeps are characterized by spindles and vertex

waves



Generalized slowing is present.



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. generalized background slowing

2. slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.

3. FIRDA



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are nonspecific but are frequently found in


association with a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which

can include toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, medication effect

or other diffuse cerebral process.  No epileptiform features were

identified.
