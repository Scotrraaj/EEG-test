HISTORY: 60 y.o. female with a history of breast CA, recent crani, skull defect, cranial infection referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change. Patient appears aphasic  MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA, , VANCOMYCIN, CEFEPIME, AMPHOTERICIN  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A STAT portable  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation. Because of the cranial defect, electrodes were very limited on the right. Both R and L cranial defects are present but marked R frontal  EEG BACKGROUND: The background is characterized by the presence of an organized symmetric mixture of 4 Hz theta frequencies and delta with scant alpha, with a hint of a reactive theta posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  With verbal stimuli, there is EOM and an increase in theta.   Sleep is NOT defined  Marked generalized slowing is present.   R sided focal slowing is present. R sided delta  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Isolated singe sharps T4 FP1  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: see above  EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal ICU STAT EEG due to: 1. Marked background slowing 2. Though there are few electrodes on the right, R focal slowing   CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are suggestive of a generalized process. No seizures were recorded.  Given the cranial defects, there are no major epileptiform findings.  Results reported to the team on 07/24/2016
