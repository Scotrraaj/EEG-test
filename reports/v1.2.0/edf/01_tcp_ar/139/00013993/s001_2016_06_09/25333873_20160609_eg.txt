SEDATION: None reported


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and  Tactile  stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The  background is markedly abnormal.  There is a continuous, reasonably symmetric pattern of
arrhythmic mixed theta and delta.  There are bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity.
Posteriorly predominant triphasic waves are noted but there are also some occipitally predominant
triphasic waves seen.  There is clear variability in the record.  Tactile stimulation of the patient
produces an alerting with an increase in faster frequency activity.  There may be a subtle asymmetry
with a bit more slowing on the right in comparison to the left



Moderate to severe generalized slowing is present.


Subtle focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Triphasic waves, FIRDA


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  See above


EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 irregular  bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:

1. replacement of normal background with a markedly slow pattern


2. Triphasic waves

3. FIRDA

4. Shifting slowing, more so on the right



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are frequently found in association with toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  No
seizures were recorded
