HISTORY: Female Unknown White is a 26 y.o. female who was found in her room unresponsive, brought to ED, and went into PEA arrest, followed by ROSC, followed by V-tach arrest, referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events: episodes of right gaze preference while comatose.  MEDICATIONS: None listed  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (7/27/2016, 22:30 - 7/28/2016, 13:40)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous and symmetric, but poorly organized, and consists predominantly of theta and delta slowing.  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and sleep transients are not seen.  As the record progresses there is decreased prevalence of delta and increasing prevalence of alpha rhythm.  The background is not clearly reactive, but is variable.  By 7/28 09:50 an awake pattern emerges: there is fairly organized alpha, beta, and excess theta. Fragments of a symmetric posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz are seen.  There is moderate to severe generalized slowing that improves by end of day to mild generalized slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 120s  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate to severe generalized slowing that improves to mild over the course of the day 2. Tachycardia  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral dysfunction that improves by the end of the study. Tachycardia is seen on a single EKG lead.
