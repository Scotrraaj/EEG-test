History:	40 YR FEMALE IN OR FOR PULMONARY THROMBOEMBOLECTOMY
Medications:	VERSED, EPHINEPHRINE, ROCURONIUM, ETOMIDATE, FENTANYL, 
	ISOFLURANE, LIDOCAINE, SOLU MEDROL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  With anesthesia and cooling the background proggresively becomes 
slower, starts decreasing in amplitude and later intermittently attenuated.  Then it becomes burst 
suppresion with some intermittent low amplitude diffuse periodic discharges unitl it is completely 
attenuated.  The primary team is alerted about complete suppresion. After cardiac arrest and 
warming the background reappears and slowly reaches a symmetric diffuse theta/ delta activity with 
some frontocentral faster frequencies.  INCISION:  8:54AM,  HEPARIN: 9:14AM 35000U, BYPASS: 
9:27AM, COOLING: 9:27AM, SUPPRESSION: 10:36AM, CROSS CLAMPED 10:36AM,  
CIRRCULATORY ARREST:10:46A,  CARDIAC ARREST:11:25A , WARMING: 11:48AM
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.
Summary of Findings:
	No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a uneventful 5Hr EEG during an PTE surgery with hypothermia. All changes were 
communicated to the surgical team.
