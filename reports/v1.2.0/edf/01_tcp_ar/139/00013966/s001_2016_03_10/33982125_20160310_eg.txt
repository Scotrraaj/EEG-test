HISTORY:

35 y.o. male with a history of H/O NEW ONSET X

1 YR OF  SZ ACTIVIY DURING SLEEP, DENIES B/B IBCONT, TONGUE


BITING. SHAKING SPELLS. LAST EPISODE X 1 MONTH AGO. PMHX SIG FOr

DM referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.



MEDICATIONS:

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was

recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically




satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and

photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and


amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with POSTS

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and


K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180

seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) induces  Minimal symmetric photic


driving, which is a normal finding.  The patient was basically

and stage II sleep during photic stimulation



EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 56 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is anormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

A normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If


seizures are an important consideration a followup study may be

considered.
