HISTORY:

75 y.o.FEMALE S/P CARDIAC ARREST ON 12/7.  UNKOWN TIME. CHF,
ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY.   NEURO EVAL.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) split-tablet 12.5 mg

ceFAZolin (ANCEF) 2,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 60 mg

famotidine (PEPCID) 40 mg/5 mL (8 mg/mL) suspension 20 mg

amLODIPine (NORVASC) tablet 10 mg


insulin lispro (HumaLOG) injection 1-5 Units

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) oral solution 650 mg

dextrose 50% injection 25 mL


dextrose 50% injection 50 mL

glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:



No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.



Diffuse, posterior maximal periodic sharp waves with a triphasic morphology are present throughout
the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate a phase lag and become more prominent with
stimulation.




Sleep is not captured


Generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

See above sharp waves.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

Verbal, tactile and occular stimulation causes minimal changes (see above).



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:




1.  Posterior predominant periodic discharges with a triphasic morphology

2.  Moderate to severe diffuse slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal comatose routine EEG due to posterior predominant periodic discharges with a
triphasic morphology and moderate to severe diffuse background slowing.  These findings are
indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but can be due to a
metabolic derangement or at times can be seen in association with hypoxic injury. No seizures were
seen however if there is concern for subclinical seizures continuous monitoring may be beneficial.
