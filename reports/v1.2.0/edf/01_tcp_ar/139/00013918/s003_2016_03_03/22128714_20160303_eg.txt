DATE OF STUDY: 03/03/2016-

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:


EEG TYPE: LTM





HISTORY:

a 36 y.o. female with a history of S/P CODE ON

2/3/16 AM FOR APPROX 30 MIN, and then second code after


tracheostomy.  FOLLOW UP EEG NOTED WITH RhYHTMIC

ARMS AND FOOT MOVEMENTS, referred for routine LTM for subclinical

seizures


MEDICATIONS: None provided by the technologist

Vacomycin, Synthroid, Meripenem, NORepinephrine.

SEDATION: unknown



TECHNIQUE:

Continuous Bedside portable digital video 21 channel


electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International

10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system.

This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single


channel of EKG and tactile stimulation. Seizure and spike




detection software was used.

DAY 1 (03/03, 17:00 - 3/4/2016, 15:27)



AEDs: none

EEG BACKGROUND: Initially at 5 PM the background EEG is  is

a low-voltage, featureless pattern with little Superimposed


Muscle artifact.

Generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.



Over the course of the first EEG monitoring this transitions to a

burst suppression pattern with rhythmic mixed theta delta.  By

the afternoon of March 4, EEG is more continuous with


intermittent suppressions and a pattern of more rhythmic 4 Hz

theta activity.



Eye movement artifact is noted rarely.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


EVENTS:


none



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 116131 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal ICU EEG EEG monitor due to:

1. replacement of normal cerebral activity for an adult of this


age with an increasingly suppressed  pattern.

2. transition to a burst suppression pattern.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are suggestive of a severe, bihemispheric

disturbance of cerebral function.










-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 2 (03/04/2016, 15:27 - 3/5/2016, 10:36)


AEDs: none

BACKGROUND: The EEG transitions to a gradually more continuous


theta pattern.  By the 5th, there is some 11 Hz alpha as well as

6 Hz theta and infrequent attenuation of the background.


GENERALIZED SLOWING: present.



FOCAL SLOWING: None.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or


detected. Stimulation of the patient did not clearly alter the

record.


EKG: A single EKG lead captured 96 BPM





DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION and overall conclusion:



Transition from attenuated pattern to burst suppression pattern

and then a continuous pattern without clear reactivity, continues


to suggest significant CNS insult. Correlation with exam and

imaging my be helpful. No seizures or epileptiform discharges.
