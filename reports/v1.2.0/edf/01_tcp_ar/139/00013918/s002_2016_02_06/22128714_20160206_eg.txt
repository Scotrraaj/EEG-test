HISTORY: 36 y.o. female who is s/p cardiac arrest x25-30 min on 2/3/16 AM, referred for EEG for assessment of mental status change and posturing.  MEDICATIONS: vasopressin, epinephrine  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (2/5/2016, 19:24 - 2/6/2016, 12:52)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, fairly organized, and consists predominantly of theta with occasional admixed alpha and delta. Posterior dominant rhythm is 5-6 Hz.  There are no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.  Sleep is characterized by further background slowing, with occasional <1 period seconds of attenuation. Well-formed sleep transients are not seen.  There is moderate generalized slowing. There is no focal slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Rare diffuse (posterior-predominant) sharp waves, activated by sleep, not clearly epileptiform  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 60s-70s.   IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization 2. Rare diffuse (posterior-predominant) sharp waves are seen in sleep, but these are not clearly epileptiform.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are indicative of moderate diffuse slowing.
