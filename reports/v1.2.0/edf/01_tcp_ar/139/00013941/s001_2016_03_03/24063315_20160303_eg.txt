HISTORY:

21-year-old male with abnormal metal status, T-

clonic seizures, recently in ED for post ictal confusion. Blind.


referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.  CT

demonstrated small serpiginous

hyperdensity in the posterior left frontal lobe white matter


which is favored to represent a benign developmental venous

anomaly



MEDICATIONS:

No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

No current medications reported at this visit.



SEDATION:none



TECHNIQUE:




A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is abnormal and includes a low amplitude,

symmetric pattern without posterior dominant rhythm, and  diffuse


background slowing  With scant theta and low voltage diffuse

beta.



Sleep is hard to discern, but there are some bursts of

generalized slowing noted.



Generalized slowing is present.

No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: produces a few bursts of higher amplitude


delta/theta.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.


EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66  bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Replacement of normal background with a slow low voltage

pattern.

2. Absence of the normal wave forms including alpha



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are non specific but support a diffuse


bihemispheric process. No sharp waves were seen.
