HISTORY:

UNKNOWN AGE MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O ALLEGED ASSAULT



MEDICATIONS:

No AEDs



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta
activity. At times a posterior dominant rhythm of at best 9 Hz is seen.




Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Mild to moderate diffuse slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse background
slowing.  This finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.


No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
