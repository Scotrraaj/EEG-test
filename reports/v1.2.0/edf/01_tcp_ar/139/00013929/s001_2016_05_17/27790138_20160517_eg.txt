DATE OF STUDY: 05/17/16

TEGRETOL

TECHNIQUE:

A  Bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal  stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The patient is awake, but has slurred speech the waking background is symmetric, reactive, and slow
and disorganized.  It is a mixed frequency background with generalized theta and a 6 Hz posterior
dominant rhythm.  Prominent frontal beta was noted. Sleep is characterized by vertex and beta
spindles




Generalized slowing is present.  Modest shifting  slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

FIRDA


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 78b pm is captured on a single EKG lead.





IMPRESSION:

This is an  abnormal routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.

1. generalized background slowing and poor organization

2. FIRDA


3. Prominent frontal beta

CLINICAL CORRELATION:

The features described above are nonspecific.  They are most supportive of a toxic or metabolic
encephalopathy but can be seen in other clinical scenarios


This routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
