START DATE OF STUDY: 01/17/17 at 15:15 END DATE OF STUDY: 01/18/17  RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: long term monitoring   HISTORY: a 71 y.o. MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O NSTEMI SHOCK CIRCULATORY ARREST 1/16/17 BECAME BRADYCARDIA, LOSS PULSE, WENT FOR STAT CATH.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: EPINEPHrine (ADRENALIN) 4 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL infusion hydrocortisone sod succ (PF) (Solu-CORTEF) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg vancomycin (VANCOCIN) 1,000 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL IVPB MB+ atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 80 mg insulin regular (HumuLIN R,NovoLIN R) injection 10 Units phenylephrine (NEO-SYNEPHRINE) 80 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL infusion vasopressin (PITRESSIN) 100 Units in sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL infusion sodium chloride 0.9 % 250 mL with DOPamine 400 mg infusion heparin 25,000 units (100 units/mL) in 0.45% sodium chloride 250 mL infusion (Premix) sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL fentaNYL (SUBLIMAZE) 1 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion amiodarone in dextrose (NEXTERONE) 360 mg/200 mL (1.8 mg/mL) infusion norepinephrine (LEVOPHED) 16 mg/250 mL (64 mcg/mL) in NSS infusion white petrolatum-mineral oil (LACRI-LUBE) ophthalmic ointment 1 Application propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion furosemide (LASIX) injection 40 mg piperacillin-tazobactam (ZOSYN) 3.375 g in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB MB+ pantoprazole (PROTONIX) injection 40 mg clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg insulin regular 100 units in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL infusion dextrose 50% injection 25 mL dextrose 50% injection 50 mL glucagon (human recombinant) (GLUCAGEN) injection 1 mg   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (1/17/2017, 06:00 - 1/18/2017, 16:00) EEG BACKGROUND: At onset no posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by mainly diffuse low voltage delta (at times almost completely attenuated) and some theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. Some faster theta frequencies seen at the end.   During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.   Sleep is not captured  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. Some variability is noted.  EVENTS: There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of  66bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
