HISTORY:

41 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P CARDIAC ARREST. DOWN TIME
APPROX 30 MIN


MEDICATIONS:

Norepinephrine and epinephrine


SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
with continuous breathing artifact at 0.5Hz and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm is present.


The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen.





There is no electro cerebral activity over 2uV during the recording.



There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or
tactile stimuli.



This EEG was not performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology
Society for the determination of electro cerebral inactivity.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Electro-cerebral silence



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an isoelectric EEG not performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the determination of
electrocerebral inactivity.  This EEG is consistent with, but not diagnostic of, cerebral death.
