HISTORY:

a 58 y.o. male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented in status epilepticus,
referred for routine EEG for management of seizure exacerbation.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

sodium chloride (sodium chloride 0.9%) 0.9 % 50 mL with thiamine (B-1) 100 mg

LORazepam (ATIVAN) 50 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL infusion


ESETT (NCT01960075) infusion

sodium chloride 0.9 % IV bolus

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 50 mL IVPB


LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg

propofol (DIPRIVAN) 1000 mg/100 mL IV infusion




S/p fosphenytoin load, on Ativan and propofol drips



SEDATION: as above



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background consists of a burst attenuation pattern.

Bursts consist of 1-4 sec of disorganized alpha/theta/beta. Attenuation lasts 4-7 seconds.


There is no reactivity, variability, or state change.


Severe generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 86 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal coma study routine EEG due to:


1. Burst-attenuation pattern, with disorganization and lack of reactivity





CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings indicate the presence of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may at least in
part be associated with a medication effect.
