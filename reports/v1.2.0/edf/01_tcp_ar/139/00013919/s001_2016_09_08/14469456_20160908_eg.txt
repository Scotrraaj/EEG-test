DATE OF STUDY: 09/08/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

a 115 y.o. male with a history of recurrent seizures yesterday, requiring intubation,
now extubated, agitated and uncooperative,  referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

phenytoin (DILANTIN) tablet 300 mg

thiamine tablet 100 mg


folic acid (FOLVITE) tablet 1 mg

pantoprazole (PROTONIX) EC tablet 40 mg

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 1 mg


sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

LORazepam (ATIVAN) injection 2 mg


heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units




TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  Difficult record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The  background is characterized by a low voltage pattern with delta, scant theta and rare alpha.
With agitation, FIRDA is noted


Marked generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present. However, there is a lot of artifact


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


FIRDA


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: verbal stimuli and consoling was attempted



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:


1. Limited study but very slow background.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings may indicate post ictal state, medication effect or other cause of encephalopathy.  To
better assess his EEG pattern, please consider repeat when he is cooperative.
