HISTORY:

52 y.o. MAN S/P CODE X2  CPR UNKNOWN TIME ON 5/20/16.  EEG FOR
HYPOXIC BRAIN INJ.  PMHX: ETOH ABUSE




MEDICATIONS:


ATIVAN STOPPED 9:30AM, HEPARIN, VANCOMYCIN,THIAMINE, LABETALOL


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record due
to a diffuse EMG artifact and included a single channel of EKG.





EEG BACKGROUND:





No posterior dominant rhythm is present.  The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is
not seen.



There is no clear electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording. There is no spontaneous
state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli.



Sleep is not captured



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Isoelectric EEG



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an isoelectric EEG not performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical
Neurophysiology Society for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.
