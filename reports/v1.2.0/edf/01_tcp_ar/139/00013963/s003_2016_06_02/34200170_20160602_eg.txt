HISTORY: 52 y.o. male with a history of diffuse cerebral edema related to hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, episode of eye flutter referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.  MEDICATIONS: Clonidine, insulin  Norvasc, HCTZ    SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and Verbal/ tactile stimulation. T 99.  EEG BACKGROUND: There is scant cerebral activity. There is rare, low voltage slow delta noted in R fronto temporal region.  There is no reactivity.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Tactile stimulation produces artifact  EVENTS: There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.  HEART RATE: A heart rate of 80 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal ICU routine EEG due to: 1. Paucity of cerebral activity 2. Absence of variability or reactivity.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings indicate a severe CNS insult. This EEG should be correlated with clinical features.
