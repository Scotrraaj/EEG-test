HISTORY:

52 y.o. male with a history of hypoxic brain injury in the setting of a code,
referred for routine EEG for assessment of altered mental status.



MEDICATIONS: heparin, insulin



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG. This study was not performed according to ACNS guidelines
for assessing electrocerebral inactivity.




EEG BACKGROUND:


The background consists of diffusely suppressed activity, mainly delta, which is not definitely cerebral
in origin.




There is no reactivity to verbal or noxious stimulation, variability, or state change.



Severe generalized slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG, not performed according to the guidelines of the
American Clinical Neurophysiology Society for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity, due to:


1. Suppression of background activity



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
