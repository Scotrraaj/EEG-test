HISTORY:

56 y.o. male with a history of nearsyncopal event.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


acetaminophen-codeine (TYLENOL #3) 300-30 mg per tablet 1 tablet

doxazosin (CARDURA) tablet 4 mg

triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide (DYAZIDE) 37.5-25 mg per capsule 1 capsule


cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) tablet 5 mg

gabapentin (NEURONTIN) tablet 800 mg

clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 80 mg

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg








SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:


A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The very brief waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a
moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.





During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


No epileptiform activity is present.


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:




A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and mostly asleep  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic
events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normalawake and mostly asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
