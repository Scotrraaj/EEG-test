DATE OF STUDY: 04/29/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, coma





HISTORY:

a 86 y.o. male was found in cardiac arrest one day prior to this EEG, now intubated
and comatose in the ICU referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


simvastatin (ZOCOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.

warfarin (COUMADIN) 5 mg tablet, TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH ONCE DAILY

metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 25 mg 24 hr tablet, TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH ONCE DAILY


levothyroxine (SYNTHROID, LEVOTHROID) 100 mcg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. TAKE
ONE TABLET BY MOUTH ONCE DAILY


digoxin (LANOXIN) 125 mcg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

budesonide (PULMICORT) 0.5 mg/2 mL nebulizer solution, USE ONE VIAL IN NEBULIZER TWICE
DAILY
budesonide (PULMICORT) 0.5 mg/2 mL nebulizer solution, USE ONE VIAL IN NEBULIZER TWICE
DAILY

PERFOROMIST 20 mcg/2 mL nebulizer solution, TAKE 2 MLS BY NEBULIZATION ROUTE EVERY
12 HOURS
glimepiride (AMARYL) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every morning (before breakfast).

theophylline (THEODUR) 200 mg 12 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.




warfarin (COUMADIN) 5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. 1 1/2 tablet one day a week

hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 12.5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


PORTABLE OXYGEN, INCLUDING ALL ACCESSORIES,, 4 L by Misc.(Non-Drug; Combo Route)
route. Use as directed



Current facility-administered medications for this visit.

VERSED DRIP 4, KEPPRA,  DOBUTAMINE, ATORVASTATIN, METOPROLOL, KLONOPIN,
PROTONIX, INSULIN,



SEDATION: VERSED DRIP 4,



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and vigorous stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The background is her only abnormal and includes a burst suppression pattern.  Brief bursts of mixed
frequency activity including alpha theta, scant beta and some delta are noted.  Most bursts are 1
second or less in duration, none longer than 3 seconds.  Typically, 1-3 bursts are noted in a 15
second period



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Vigorous stimulation does not seem to accentuate the bursts



EVENTS:

There are no  electrographic events captured during this study.  The use of an EMG monitor on the
chin demonstrates twitching of the chin in association with the bursts


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 120, irreg bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal ICU EEG due to:


1. replacement of normal background with a burst suppression pattern




2. absence of reactivity or variability



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings are suggestive of a significant cerebral insult.  The time of the patient's cardiac arrest,
as well as the use of sedative hypnotic medications may be mitigating factors.  No epileptic seizures
were noted
