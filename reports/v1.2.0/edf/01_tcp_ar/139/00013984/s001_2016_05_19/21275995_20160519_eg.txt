DATE OF STUDY: 05/19/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 96 y.o. male with a history of seizure many years ago referred for routine
EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


levothyroxine (SYNTHROID) 100 mcg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily for 360 days. Discontinue
75 mcg dose


lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide (PRINZIDE,ZESTORETIC) 10-12.5 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by
mouth daily.

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 80 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


furosemide (LASIX) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth 2 times daily.

aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.


phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth 3 times daily.

ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 800 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours as needed for Pain.

lorazepam (ATIVAN) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily as needed for Anxiety.




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.





HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 55 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Irregular



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG for an adult of any age.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
