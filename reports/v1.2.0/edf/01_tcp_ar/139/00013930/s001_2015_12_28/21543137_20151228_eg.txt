HISTORY:

55 y.o. male referred for routine EEG for

after presenting with an episode of aphasia for 90 sec, with a


negative MRI brain.


MEDICATIONS: none listed



SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a


NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and

included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:




The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a


symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).

The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and


amplitude is present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse


background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with

synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.

There is frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing.


There is both independent and synchronous frequent right

hemispheric polymorphic slowing.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing


2. Independent and synchronous frequent right hemispheric

polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of left temporal and right

hemispheric cerebral dysfunction.
