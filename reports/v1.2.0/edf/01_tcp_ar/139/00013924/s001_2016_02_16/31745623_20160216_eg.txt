HISTORY:

69 y.o. male with a history of heart transplant

(2/15), HTN, DM, and syncope, now with loss of consciousness with


shaking, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal

events.



MEDICATIONS: CELLCEPT, INSULIN, BACTRIM, AMLODIPINE, CELEXA,

PROGRAF



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.





EEG BACKGROUND:


The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well

organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with


occasional excess of diffuse theta and delta frequencies. There

is a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm

(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.


Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with


synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and

K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Mild generalized slowing is present.

Occasional bitemporal independent polymorphic slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.


Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21

flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during

this study.



HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Mild generalized slowing

2. Occasional bitemporal independent polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of

bitemporal dysfunction superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral

dysfunction.
