HISTORY:

39 y.o. female with a history of seizures

referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 300 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth

2 times daily.

divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 250 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3


times daily.

baclofen (LIORESAL) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth 3 times

daily.


sertraline (ZOLOFT) 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth daily.


SEDATION: None






TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the


International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.


EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well


organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a

symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).


The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and

amplitude is present.


During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and


fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse

background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured.


No generalized slowing is present.


Occasional right temporal polymorphic slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional (1/hour to <1min) right temporal (T2 max) sharp waves

are present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180


seconds with fair cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric

background slowing.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21


flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1. Occasional right temporal polymorphic slowing

2. Occasional (1/hour to <1min) right temporal (T2 max) sharp

waves





CLINICAL CORRELATION:

These findings indicate the presence of right temporal

epileptogenic discharges superimposed on right temporal slowing.
