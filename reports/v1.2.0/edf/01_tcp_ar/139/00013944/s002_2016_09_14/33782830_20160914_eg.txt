DATE OF STUDY: 09/14/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 60 min - 3 hr, awake and asleep





HISTORY:

a 36 y.o. female with a history of seizures since age 10, with epilepsy exacerbation
9/13 in the setting of being arrested, having a UTI, and med noncompliance, referred for routine
EEG for characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (BACTRIM DS) 800-160 mg per tablet 1 tablet

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion


docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg

acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 750 mg

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) tablet 100 mg





SEDATION: None; did receive benzodiazepines in ER on day prior



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and excess beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by synchronous and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes.



No generalized slowing is present.

Occasional right posterior temporal (T4/T6 max) polymorphic slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.


EVENTS:


9/22/2016 at 09:20

Clinical: Body jerk

EEG: no associated epileptiform features. A drowsy background mildly arouses following the jerk



HEART RATE:

A heart rate in the 80-90s is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:




This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:

1. Occasional right posterior temporal (T4/T6 max) polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of right posterior temporal dysfunction.

The body jerk described above is likely an episode of physiologic/benign myoclonus.

Excess beta is consistent with this patient's history of barbiturate and benzodiazepine use.


There were no epileptiform features captured during this EEG; and no clinical or electrographic
events were reported or detected.
