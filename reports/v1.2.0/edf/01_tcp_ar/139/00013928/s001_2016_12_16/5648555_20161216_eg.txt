HISTORY:

70 y.o. male with a history of pontine CVA, in 2012 and asthma presented with
"founding down" with hypothermia and LOC. The patient could not recall any details, but had temp
of 86, LA of 10 and glucose of 200s on admission.  referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental
status change.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Facility-Administered Medications:


benzocaine-menthol (CHLORASEPTIC) lozenge 1 lozenge

cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN) 1 g in dextrose 5 % 100 mL IVPB MB+

sodium chloride 0.9 % infusion


acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg

ondansetron (PF) (ZOFRAN) injection 4 mg

albuterol (PROVENTIL) nebulizer solution 2.5 mg


heparin (5000 units/mL) injection 5,000 Units

aspirin chewable tablet 81 mg

simvastatin (ZOCOR) tablet 10 mg


TECHNIQUE:


A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and verbal  stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
theta alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is
scant alpha rhythm and generalized theta noted in wakefulness




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Mild  generalized slowing is present.


No focal slowing is present.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile stimulation elicits an arousal


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 50-60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to:

1.  Mild background slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings are nonspecific and supporting mild diffuse disturbance of cerebral function,
compatible with acute renal injury and other metabolic disturbances as described above
