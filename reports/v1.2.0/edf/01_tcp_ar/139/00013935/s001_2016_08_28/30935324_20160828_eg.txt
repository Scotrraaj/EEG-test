HISTORY:

64 y.o. female with a history of intraventricular hemorrhage, TC sz last night,
obtundation referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.



MEDICATIONS:

SEDATION: see above



TECHNIQUE:

A STAT portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile /verbal stimulation.



EEG BACKGROUND:


The  background is characterized by a slow pattern with repetitive seizures. The overall background is
a mixture of theta and delta with smaller amounts of alpha


Marked generalized slowing is present.

Focal slowing is not prominent.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

The record begins with a 2:50 Min sz - with repetitive sharp waves P4 O2.  There is a second 1:33
min sz @1:52 PM.  In between there are two other subtle seizures with paroxysmal fast - R CT>R FC
region

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.


EVENTS:


There are no clinical events captured during this study. Seizures are electrographic only


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal ICU STAT  EEG due to:



1. Status epilepticus defined as repetitve seizures from R hemisphere in intubated, comatose patient



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings were communicated to the clinical team and the patient went on to EEG monitor.
