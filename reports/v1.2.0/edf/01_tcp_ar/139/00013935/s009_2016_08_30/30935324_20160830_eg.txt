This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile/verbal stimulation.  DAY 1 (8/28/2016, 14:00, - 8/28/2016, 06:00) Fosphenytoin was initiated very slowly due to hypotension.  EEG BACKGROUND: The background is characterized by a slow pattern with repetitive seizures. The overall background is a mixture of theta and delta with smaller amounts of alpha.  Phenytoin was infused, and as seizures abated, a diffusely slow pattern was seen. Marked generalized slowing is present.   Focal slowing is not prominent.   EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: The record begins with a 14:00 - with a seizure at P4-O2 Ictal patterns are noted with often at least 1 seizure per hour:  1 repetitive sharp waves P4 O2. typical duration 1.5 -3.0 minutes, No clinical features  2. subtle seizures with paroxysmal fast - R CT region, notes early in this section 3. Tactile stimulation and arousals produce L CT focal rhythmic slowing, but at least early on it occurs spontaneously, over minutes, c/w and electrographic seizure 4. Interictal sharp waves, T4 T3 T5 OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  none  ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli: L focal delta  EVENTS: There are no clinical events captured during this study. Seizures are electrographic only  EKG: A single lead captured HR 90 BPM  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal long-term video EEG due to: 1. Multiple  ictal patterns 2. Markedly slow background 3.
