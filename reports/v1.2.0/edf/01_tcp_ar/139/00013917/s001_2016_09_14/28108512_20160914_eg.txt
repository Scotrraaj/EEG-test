HISTORY:

61 y.o. male with a history of seizures after MVA in 2000 (LOC, bowel/bladder
incontinence, postictal confusion) - most recently 9/13/2016, referred for routine EEG for
characterization of seizures.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth daily.

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.

oxycodone (ROXICODONE) 30 mg immediate release tablet, Take 30 mg by mouth every 4 hours as
needed for Pain.


aspirin EC 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily.



SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:





A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-7 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any EEG changes; this procedure was terminated as patient complained of headache.



EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is a normal awake only routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.






CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is a normal awake only routine EEG.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.

If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
