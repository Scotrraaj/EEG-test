HISTORY:

79 y.o. female with a history of unresponsiveness on Sunday referred for routine
EEG for assessment of mental status change.


79-year-old female with a history of recent hemorrhagic CVA requiring PEG placement for dysphagia
(11/17), epilepsy on Keppra, who presented to TUH with failure to thrive like picture (hyperosmolar,
poor PO intake, altered mental status). She had a seizure-like episode 11/20/2016  requiring Ativan
and intubation followed by transfer to the ICU. Stroke alert called, NCHCT was negative for new
pathologies.  Previous left craniotomy with resolving thalamic hemorrhage and clip.



MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % 100 mL IVPB



TECHNIQUE:

A bedside ICU Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically  satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and verbal stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:



Although the patient was somnolent, with stimulation the background is characterized by bilateral
theta.


Moderate generalized slowing is present.

Intermittent left temporal focal slowing and breach is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:none



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  EVENTS:


There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:


A heart rate of 68 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormaI ICU EEG due to:

1. In maximal wakefulness, somewhat slow background

2. Left fronto-temporal focal slowing in context of breach rhythm.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings may be correlated with clinical picture and focal features. No epileptiform features
were noted. This is an awake, intubated adult.
