No current facility-administered medications for this visit.


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel one hour electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by symmetric and reactive medium voltage 9-10 Hertz
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Bilaterally
symmetric low voltage frontal central beta activity was seen.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.



Infrequent low-voltage sharp transients were seen in the left mid temporal region at T3 during
drowsiness, at times having the appearance of temporal wicket, with several of these discharges
possibly representing benign epileptiform transients of sleep (BETS).




ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:



A heart rate of 100 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a probably normal awake and asleep one hour EEG.  Infrequent low amplitude sharp
transients in the left temporal region during drowsiness and sleep most likely represent temporal
wicket activity and benign epileptiform transients of sleep. There are no other clinical or
electrographic events reported or detected.
