DATE OF STUDY: 09/23/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only




HISTORY:

a 77 y.o. male s/p right lung transplant. PMH pulmonary fibrous, DVT



Per nurse stopped following commands

SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.



EEG BACKGROUND:


No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by an disorganized
theta and some delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.



Sleep is not captured



Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal regions.






EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.





EVENTS:


There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


1. Intermittent bilateral anterior temporal focal slow waves

2. Mild to moderate diffuse slow waves.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
anterior temporal regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.


In addition there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
