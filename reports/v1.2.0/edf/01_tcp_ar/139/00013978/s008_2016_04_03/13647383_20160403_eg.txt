HISTORY:

56 y.o. female with a history of ICH,

s/p craniotomy several days ago referred for routine EEG for


assessment of mental status change.  R frontal ventriculostomy,

biparietal scalp effusions, resolving but still present on the

right.



MEDICATIONS:

Recent Outpatient Prescriptions:


acetaminophen-codeine (TYLENOL #3) 300-30 mg per tablet, Take 1

tablet by mouth every 4 hours as needed for Pain.

atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily.


Insulin Glargine (LANTUS SOLOSTAR) 100 unit/mL (3 mL) Insulin

Pen, Inject  into the skin nightly.

levothyroxine (SYNTHROID, LEVOTHROID) 112 mcg tablet, Take 112


mcg by mouth daily.




metformin (GLUCOPHAGE) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1,000 mg by mouth 2

times daily (with meals).


metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) 25 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth

daily.


olanzapine (ZYPREXA) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth nightly.

risperiDONE (RISPERDAL) 2 mg tablet, Take 2 mg by mouth 2 times

daily.

ibuprofen (IBUPROFEN IB) 200 mg tablet, 2 PO STAT


azithromycin (ZITHROMAX Z-PAK) 250 mg tablet, Take 2 by mouth on

day , then 1 by mouth on days 2-5


methylPREDNIsolone (MEDROL, PAK,) 4 mg tablet, follow package

directions

And others, including Klonopin

Current facility-administered medications for this visit.


Phenobarbital/Phenytoin



SEDATION: None, Midazolam was stopped two days ago.


TECHNIQUE:

A bedside portable Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram


(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 systemwith T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically


satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and

tactile and auditory stimulation.  The patient is intubated,

poorly responsive with out involuntary movements.



EEG BACKGROUND:

The  background is characterized by the presence of a mixture of


5 and 7 hertz theta  And 1.5 Hz delta frequencies, without

symmetric, reactive posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal

anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is

absent.  There is a suggestion of a breech with more theta in the


left frontal region.  Eye movements are seen.



Following stimulation there is a vigorous production of bilateral

frontal theta.



Sleep is not captured



Generalized slowing is present.


Focal slowing is not prominent.


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


None


ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  See above



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.


HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal ICU routine EEG due to:

1. Generalized background slowing


CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are non specific but support a bihemispheric

process. In comparison to prior studies  (LTM) this record is


richer in faster frequency activity and is reactive. The

effusions on the right scalp may play a role in the theta

asymmetry described above.
