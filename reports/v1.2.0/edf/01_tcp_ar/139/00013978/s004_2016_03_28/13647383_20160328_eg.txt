Keppra, Phenytoin


SEDATION: Initially- none reported



TECHNIQUE:

Continuous video  electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using

the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized

a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG and seizure and spike detection

Software.


Patient is described as intubated and poorly responsive.

DAY 1(3/26 - 3/27/2016, 06:00)

AEDS: Phenytoin

BACKGROUND:


The  background is continuous consists of an asymmetric pattern.

Overall background is a mixture of theta and delta,  But much of


the record, there is an asymmetry with more of a featureless

delta pattern noted on the left.

The background is reactive, and variable.  Over the course of

this 24-hour section, the patient is increasingly alert with eye


opening and in increase in background theta.

Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.


There were  asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was not well defined in this  study.



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY nonsignificant



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare left temporal sharp waves T3.

No seizures were recorded.  No involuntary movements were

identified.


EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60-90 BPM. Regular



DAY 1  MPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Markedly slow background, compatible with large intracerebral

hemorrhage, but demonstrating some improvement with an increase

in theta..  Focal features, congruent with hemorrhage.  Rare


sharp waves.

DAY 2(3/27 06:00- 3/28/2016, 06:00)

AEDS: Phenytoin


BACKGROUND:

The  background is continuous consists though it is an asymmetric


pattern.  Overall the background is a mixture of theta and delta,

but   there is an asymmetry with intermittent slowing which

includes featureless delta pattern noted on the left.The

background is reactive, and variable.


Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.



There were  asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.


Sleep was not well defined in this coma study .



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY nonsignificant



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare left temporal sharp waves T3.


3 likely  seizures were recorded.

4:25 AM, 3:36 PM 5:26 these were characterized by rhythmic 4 Hz


theta activity from the left hemisphere.  While this has some

features of an artifact and it is very rhythmic, there is some


frequency of evolution at the beginning and end at each

discharge.  No clinical features could be identified during these

discharges

No involuntary movements were identified



DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Markedly slow background, compatible with large intracerebral

hemorrhage.  Focal features, congruent with hemorrhage.  Rare

sharp waves.  Overall pattern does seem to be improving with more

eye-opening, muscle activity and theta, despite the appearance of


the seizures above.

DAY 3  (06:00 3/28 - 3/29/2016, 06:00)

AEDS: Keppra, later Versed

BACKGROUND:


The  background is continuous and demonstrates a mixture of

rhythmic theta and delta Posterior dominant rhythm was not


present. The background is reactive, and variable.

There were  asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.

Sleep was not well defined in this coma study .



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare T3 sharps

Seizures:

Electrographic discharges are identified when the patient is not


moving her twitching whatsoever.  These demonstrate some

frequency evolution and are noted at 6:19, 6:59 and 10:43 AM.


Duration 30 seconds to 1.5 minutes.  The apparent electrographic

seizures are very similar to the twitch artifact but the patient


isn't moving and there is a little bit of frequency variability.

EVENTS:


1. Facial twitching

2. Facial dyskinesias


Facial twitching is associated with 4 Hz rhythmic artifact.  Most

of them so or rhythmic artifact is picked up in the left

hemisphere.  It is relatively prolonged and invariant

These are prominent throughout the daytime hours on the 28th


EKG: A single lead captured HR 96  BPM



DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Thi is a very complex record.  There are extraparametal signs for

this individual with long-standing psychiatric illness and

pre-exposure to neuroleptics.  There are some discharges which


could not be considered to BE simply muscle artifact and are

likely electrographic seizures without clinical correlate.

DAY 4 (03/29, 06:00 - 03/30/2016, 06:00)

AEDS: Keppra, Versed



Notes: EVD Catheter is placed on this day.

BACKGROUND: The overall background includes mixed frequency delta

pattern with smaller amounts of theta and some beta.  In contrast


to previous days, it is somewhat less asymmetric.  Occasional

sections of the record demonstrate more frontal delta.  Beta is


more prominent


GENERALIZED SLOWING: present



FOCAL SLOWING: Intermittent, left hemisphere



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare (<1hour) T3

Seizures: None


EVENTS: Chin twitching is associated with some rhythmic artifact



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60-90 BPM. regular




DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



No definitive electrographic seizures were identified.  The


overall background is more symmetric.  Epileptiform activity is

increasingly sparse.  Midazolam may eliminate both  voluntary

movements and electrographic seizures

----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 5 (03/30, 06:00 - 03/31/2016, 06:00)

AEDS: Keppra, Versed (Wean)

BACKGROUND: The overall background includes mixed frequency delta


pattern with smaller amounts of theta and some beta. Occasional

sections of the record demonstrate more frontal delta,


alternating with a more theta pattern.

Tactile stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster

frequency activity



GENERALIZED SLOWING: present



FOCAL SLOWING: Intermittent, left hemisphere, less prominent than

in the initial basis of recording


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare (<1hour) T3



EVENTS: None


Seizures: None

EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60 BPM. regular






DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


No definitive electrographic seizures were identified.  The

overall background is more symmetric.  It is also somewhat slower


than previous days with more delta activity. Epileptiform

activity is


increasingly sparse.  Midazolam may eliminate both  voluntary

movements and electrographic seizures.

BACKGROUND: The overall background includes mixed frequency delta

pattern with smaller amounts of theta and some beta. Occasional

sections of the record demonstrate more frontal delta,


alternating with a more theta pattern.  In comparison to earlier

days, this record has more delta.


Tactile stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster

frequency activity


GENERALIZED SLOWING: present



FOCAL SLOWING: no change


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: none



EVENTS: None

Seizures: None


EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60 BPM. regular





DAY 6 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



No definitive electrographic seizures were identified.  The


overall background is more symmetric.  Epileptiform activity is

increasingly sparse.  Midazolam may eliminate both  voluntary

movements and electrographic seizures.

----------------------------------------------------------------


FINAL IMPRESSION/  CLINICAL CORRELATION::



This is abnormal  6 day video EEG due to:



1. initially a pattern of left hemisphere or left total focal

slowing, improving over time.

2. markedly slow background

3. left temporal sharp waves, relatively infrequent noted in the


first few days of recording

4. chin and tremor artifact


5. L hemispheric discharges, likely seizures, differing from more

prolonged shin artifact in that there was frequency evolution and

no movement of the patient was noted during those discharges.

6. A dynamic pattern.  At the conclusion of this record, the EEG


is slower than it was several days ago.  This is in the context

of reduction of the Midazolam

I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents


my findings and conclusions.
