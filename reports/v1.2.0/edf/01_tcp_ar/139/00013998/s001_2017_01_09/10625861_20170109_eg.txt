DATE OF STUDY: 01/09/17

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only




HISTORY:

 a 50 y.o. male with a history of right ICH presenting with aphasia with left facial droop,
since resolved, amnestic for the episode, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal
events.


MEDICATIONS:


Current Facility-Administered Medications:

apixaban (ELIQUIS) tablet 5 mg

carvedilol (COREG) tablet 6.25 mg


clopidogrel (PLAVIX) tablet 75 mg

diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) capsule 50 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) EC tablet 5 mg

senna (SENOKOT) tablet 1 tablet

magnesium hydroxide (MILK OF MAGNESIA) suspension 30 mL


atorvastatin (LIPITOR) tablet 40 mg

folic acid (FOLVITE) tablet 1 mg



famotidine (PEPCID) tablet 20 mg






SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but
suboptimal.



Drowsiness and sleep are not captured



No generalized slowing is present.

Occasional bitemporal independent polymorphic slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



This is an abnormal awake only  routine EEG due to:

1. Suboptimal organization


2. Occasional bitemporal independent polymorphic slowing



CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of a bitemporal dysfunction superimposed on
a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.


If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
