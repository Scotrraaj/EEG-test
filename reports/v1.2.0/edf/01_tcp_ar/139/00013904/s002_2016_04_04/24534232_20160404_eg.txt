HISTORY:

64 y.o. MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O ACUTE RENAL

FAILURE. PT NOTED WITH ALTERED MENTAL STATUS WITH TONGUE BITING.


FOLLOW UP EEG, NOTED WITH SLIGHT BODY TREMOR R/O SZ.


MEDICATIONS:


NO AED, VASOPRESSIN


SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was


recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2

electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.






EEG BACKGROUND:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was


characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity

with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of


frequencies.


Diffuse, at times periodic at 1 Hz frontally maximal sharp waves

with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording.


These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.

These are more pronounced in wakefulness.



Sleep is not captured but drwosiness state changes are noted.



No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


None


OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation


are not performed.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. There

appears to be a prolonged QRS complex.



IMPRESSION:

1. Triphasic waves


2. Moderate diffuse slow



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to frequent


frontally-maximal triphasic waves and moderate diffuse background

slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse


encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but

suggestive of a metabolic origin.
