DATE OF STUDY: 06/24/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU 224


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, asleep only- coma




HISTORY:

a 58 y.o. male with a history of  pulmonary disease, status post respiratory arrest,
status post code.  Multiple cardiac arrests, and needed to the Temple emergency room at 5 AM.
Prolonged CPR in the emergency room referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status
change.




MEDICATIONS:


Epinephrine, no others reported




SEDATION: None


TECHNIQUE:


A  STAT portable ICU Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a
technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile/ verbal  Stimulation.
The patient was intubated and unresponsive





EEG BACKGROUND:

There is scant, if any cerebral activity identified.  There is no reactivity to tactile or auditory
stimulation the EEG is comprised of muscle and EKG artifact




EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

None



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.

EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 118 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal ICU STAT EEG due to:


1. no definitive cerebral activity

2. no reactivity or variability

CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These are worrisome prognostic signs.  However, it appears that this EEG may have been recorded
within 3 hours of the patient's most recent cardiac arrest. Therefore, ongoing clinical assessment is
essential.  If there are additional concerns, this EEG may be repeated at 24 hours.





Attending Epileptologist: 
I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
