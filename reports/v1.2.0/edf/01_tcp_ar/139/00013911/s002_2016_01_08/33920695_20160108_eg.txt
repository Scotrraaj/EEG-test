START DATE OF STUDY: 01/07/2016 12:09

STOP DATE OF STUDY: 01/09/2016 02:40


RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU





HISTORY:

a 61 y.o. male with a history of TB vs

Bronchopneumonia, s/p code prior at approximately 6 AM on Jan ,


2015 referred for routine EEG for hypothermia protocol.



MEDICATIONS:




SEDATION:




TECHNIQUE:

Continuous video EEG monitor 21 channel electroencephalogram

(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with


T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a

technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of

EKG and limited tactile stimulation.  ECHMO artifact was noted







DAY 1 (1/7/2016 12:09 - 1/8/2016 06:00)

The patient has already been cooled to 33 degrees at the start of


the EEG.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The EEG pattern is essentially suppressed, without signficant

reactivity or variability.  ECHMO and ICU artifacts are noted




EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.




Day 1 IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION:


Suppressed cerebral pattern in the context of therapeutic

hypothermia



Attending Epileptologist: 


I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents

my findings and conclusions.

DAY 2 (1/8/2016 06:00 - 1/9/2016 02:40)




EEG BACKGROUND, EKG, EVENTS:

The EEG pattern is essentially suppressed, without signficant

reactivity or variability.




Heart rate-related artifact obscures interpretation of cerebral

rhythms over the entire left temporal chain as well as Fz, Cz,


Pz.




Severe diffuse slowing is present.

No definite focal slowing is present, though as noted above,


interpretation of cerebral rhythms over the left temporal chain

rhythms is impossible.




Note that when reading under standard sensitivities, much of the

heart rate-related artifact resolves by 1/8/2016 15:53. However,

study remains technically difficult to


interpret due to artifact over T4 and T5.




A heart rate in the 90s is captured on a single EKG lead.



As the study progresses past about 21:00, cardiac and cerebral

rhythms become increasingly suppressed.  When reviewed under


higher sensitivities, heart-rate related artifact continues to

affect interpretation of cerebral rhythms over bilateral temporal


chains as well as Fp1-F3, Fp2-F4, P4-O2.    This artifact

gradually decreases in amplitude beginning about 01:15 on

1/9/2016.  At 02:32 on 1/9/2016, the amplitude of the heart

rate-related artifact abruptly decreases. Following this, cardiac


activity followed by cerebral rhythms become completely

suppressed. Study stops at 02:40.






Day 2 IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION:




This study, though limited in interpretation due to heart

rate-related artifact captures a severe diffuse cerebral


dysfunction. On 1/9/2016 02:32, heart rate-related artifact

abruptly decreases in amplitude. Following this, cerebral rhythms

become increasingly suppressed. By the time of study cessation at

02:40, there is no evidence of cardiac or cerebral activity. This


finding is consistent with cardiac arrest.
