HISTORY:

30 y.o. MAN R HANDED PT. STATES HE HAS HAD PREVIOUS STROKE. PT HAD
AN INJURY WHILE WORKING AND SINCE 2008 HE HAS HAD SZ.. PMHX.STROKE ?



MEDICATIONS:

Dilantin, Keppra




SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:







The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-13 flashes per second (fps) were performed.
After 13Hz the patient covered his face and was slow to answer questions. Photic stimulation was
stopped.


The EEG remained unchanged.



EVENTS:

See photic.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG.  There are no clinical or electrographic events
reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:




This is a normal awake and drowsy  routine EEG. The episode during photic described above had no
EEG correlate and did not appear to be epileptic in nature.


A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
