DATE OF STUDY: 09/08/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy




HISTORY:

a 24 y.o. male with a history of seizures. "CPS" just Prior to EEG, then another
immediately after this study- poorly described by observers.


MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, TK 1 AND SS TS PO BID

levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) 250 mg tablet, Take 3 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.




TECHNIQUE:

A Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically  satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.  Patient was very drowsy, appeared to
the tech to be post-ictal.





EEG BACKGROUND:





The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of
alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.  There is
generous beta.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves,
sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.




No generalized slowing is present.

Subtle focal slowing is present.  This was primarily infrequent sharply contoured Left temporal focal
slowing but rarely on the right.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Rare (<1hour) Left anterior temporal (F7) with questionable low amplitude frontal sharp (Fp1)



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

Sharply contoured activity



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:

Photic Stimulation: elicits driving better seen on the right



EVENTS:

There are  no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:


1. Subtle but clear left frontotemporal sharp waves /spikes

2. Initially L focal slowing.

3. Excessively drowsy adult
