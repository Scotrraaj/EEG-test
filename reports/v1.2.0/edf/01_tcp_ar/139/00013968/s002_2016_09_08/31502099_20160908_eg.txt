HISTORY: 24 y.o. male with a history of TBI (2014) with possible seizures since 2/2015, now with daily episodes since past month, referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.  MEDICATIONS: Current Facility-Administered Medications: sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg LORazepam (ATIVAN) tablet 2 mg docusate sodium (COLACE) capsule 100 mg levETIRAcetam (KEPPRA) tablet 750 mg enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (9/8/2016, 19:06 - 9/9/2016, 14:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized, and consists predominantly of alpha with admixed beta and excess theta. A symmetric posterior dominant rhythm of 7-8 Hz is present bilaterally.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm and background slowing.  Sleep is characterized by synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes. Slow wave sleep was captured and normal.  There is occasional left fronto-temporal polymorphic slowing, at times sharply contoured.  There is mild generalized slowing.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  1. Rare left temporal (T3 max) sharply contoured alpha, not clearly epileptiform 2. Rare bifrontal (Fp1/Fp2/Fz max) sharply contoured alpha, not clearly epileptiform  EVENTS:  Multiple episodes of body jerking are captured:  9/8/2016 at 20:48 CLINICAL: Nurse is in room and notes "jerking." This is not well visualized on camera. Nurse states he appeared sleepy and shook his body 3x. He was oriented. Per girlfriend, this is a "minor version" of his typical habitual event. EEG: awake background present. Normal awake background. EKG: no change.  9/8/2016 at 23:02, 23:16; 9/9/2016 at 04:47, 13:28, 13:30 CLINICAL: isolated body twitches with flexion of body forward, 1-2 at a time, occurring every 2-5 seconds. Patient does not push button for and is not tested during these episodes. On rounds the following day, he confirms that these twitches are his typical habitual "seizures." EEG: awake background present. Isolated body jerks correspond with movement artifact on EEG. EKG: no change DURATION: lasts 1-4 min   In addition, an episode of the patient's typical headache is captured:  9/8/2016 at 23:32 CLINICAL: patient c/o headache and is seen in bed gripping his head with both hands, writhing back and forth. Tech notes he is crying. No associated jerks. He gradually begins rocking back and forth in bed. EEG: awake background present with associated muscle artifact EKG: HR increases from 60s to 90s bpm DURATION: ~10 min (but note amplifier disconnects after 9 min and study reconnects ~60 min later)   EKG: A single lead captured a heart rate in the 50s-60s, dipping to the 40s in sleep.  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to: 1. Mild generalized slowing 2. Occasional left fronto-temporal polymorphic slowing, at times sharply contoured 3. Episode of jerking as above, not associated with ictal EEG activity 4. Asymptomatic bradycardia  CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings indicate the presence of a left fronto-temporal cerebral dysfunction, structural or physiologic in etiology, superimposed on a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.   Sharp transients captured as described above are not clearly epileptiform.  Multiple episodes of the patient's typical habitual events captured as described above were not associated with ictal cerebral activity and are most consistent with nonepileptic events.
