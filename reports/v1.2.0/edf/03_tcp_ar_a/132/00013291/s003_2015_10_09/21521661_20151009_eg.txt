HISTORY: 84 y.o. female who presents with change in mental status concerning for subclinical seizures.    MEDICATIONS: Current Outpatient Prescriptions: polyethylene glycol (GLYCOLAX) 17 gram packet, Take 17 g by mouth daily. Senna-docusate (SENNOSIDES-DOCUSATE SODIUM) 8.6-50 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 25 mg tablet, Take 12.5 mg by mouth 2 times daily. atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 40 mg tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth daily. aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily. diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth nightly as needed for Sleep. MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE (MILK OF MAGNESIA PO), Take  by mouth. Bisacodyl (DULCOLAX) 10 mg suppository, Place 10 mg rectally daily. acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 325 mg tablet, Take 650 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for Pain. ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet, Take 325 mg by mouth daily (with breakfast). furosemide (LASIX) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. (Patient taking differently: Take 20 mg by mouth daily.) docusate sodium (COLACE) 100 mg capsule, take 100 mg by mouth 2 times daily.  hydralazine (APRESOLINE) 25 mg tablet, Take 25 mg by mouth 3 times daily.  No current facility-administered medications for this visit.   SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.  BACKGROUND: There is no PDR or AP gradient. The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low amplitude theta>delta activity.  There is continuous paucity of faster frequencies over the right frontotemporal region.   At least half of the recording is filled with high amplitude diffuse EMG artifact that makes those portions of the recording uninterpretable.   Sleep was not captured.  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captures an irregular heart rate of ~ 66 bpm.  IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal nearly 15 hour long term video EEG due to: (1) moderate diffuse slowing (2) focal right frontotemporal slowing  Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is etiologically nonspecific. continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in the right frontotemporal region.  An irregular heart rate if captured on a single EKG lead.  At least half of the recording is filled with high amplitude diffuse EMG artifact that makes those portions of the recording uninterpretable.
