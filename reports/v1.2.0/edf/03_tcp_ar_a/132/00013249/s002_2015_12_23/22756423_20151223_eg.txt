Electroencephalography Report
 
â€¨ 


Technologist:
History:		81 YO MALE PRESENTD TO TUH AS A CODE. IN CATH LAB CODED AGAIN. PT WAS PUT ON ECHMO. PT HAS NOW BEEN OFF SEDATION FOR 24 HOURS. EEG  TO RULE OUT SUBCLINICAL SZ.
Medications:		ALBUMIN, DEPACON VALPROATE, PLAVIX, ASA, PROTONIX, LIDOCAINE, METOPROLOL, PROTONIX, VANCOMYCIN, BUMEX BUMETANINDE, ZOSYN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose

Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse attenuation and absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. There are burst of diffuse
frontal maximal delta activity with some intermixed sharply countered discharges occurring periodically at 0.5Hz and lasting ~ 1second each. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, marked diffuse Periodic discharges, continuous generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of periodic discharges and diffuse background attenuation. These findings are indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction and irritability in the setting of hypoxia and
absence of sedative this is indicative of a poor prri/ is.
