CLINICAL HISTORY: A 30-year-old male admitted on September 3rd status post PEA code, with initial myoclonic jerks, and then development of CT scan with cerebral edema.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, heparin, others.

I NTRODUCTION: A 3-hour digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG. The patient was intubated, comatosed, and in a hard collar.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a dynamic recording. The initial sections of the record demonstrate a high amplitude record with frontally predominant periodic waveforms, which include frontal periodic discharges as well as triphasic waves and isolated, right or left frontal sharp waves including at F8. The recording began at 10:00 a.m. and by 11:00 a.m., the EEG pattern is somewhat more blunted and the periodic complexes are transitioning to a periodicity of 1.25-1.5 Hz in a monomorphic
background. The pattern waxes and wanes intermittently with less in the way of frontally predominant periodic complexes.  By 12:00 p.m., there is more of a monomorphic pattern with an overall background of delta-theta in the background.  By 12:46, the EEG is more of a medium or lower amplitude pattern with more blunted frontal activity.

There is a small degree of variability in the record. There is no definitive reactivity. Heart rate 136 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
	•	Replacement of normal background with a markedly slow pattern.
	•	Triphasic waves.
	•	GPEDs.
	•	Isolated sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive electrographic seizures were identified. No myoclonic jerks were noted. This EEG supports a severe CNS process, which may include both an anoxic encephalopathy and a metabolic encephalopathy.  EEG monitoring will follow.
