SEDATION:  Propofol, verset



TECHNIQUE:

A continuous video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International
10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a  technically satisfactory
record and included a single channel of EKG and seizure and spike detection software. No baseline
was recorded. Seizure and spike detection software was used. A board certified EEG physician
reviewed the data at the time of the recording.





DAY 1 (10/06/15  6 PM - 10/07/15 , 06:00)


BACKGROUND:


The waking background is symmetric,  and consists predominantly of low voltage delta and theta with
scant alpha rhythm.



Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.


The background is  reactive, and variable.



There were  no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.



Sleep was characterized by slowing.


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):


Sharply contoured activity


EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:



See below



EVENTS:  Multiple electrographic seizures were captured, typically 45-70 seconds duration.

Ictal pattern: 13-14 Hz activity L occipital with evolution. Spreads anteriorly and to central regions.
Evolves and slows. Post ictal bilateral delta. On the 7th the ictal pattern has more left frontal
involvement.


Clinical: variable, may have few features but most commonly- speech arrest, stares, looks R, L arm
immoble, R arm may pick, R arm.  Not speaking immediately after the seizures Some occur out of
sleep without arousal.




EKG: A single lead captured 90-120



DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:

Multiple focal seizures- CPS, more than 1 per hour in the first day of recording.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 2 (10/07/15  6 PM - 10/08/15 , 06:00)


Meds:

14 versed

50 fentanyl



Clinical: Patient is continuing to have seizures and was intubated and placed on versed and
fentanyl.
Once the patient was intubated the seizures were more difficult to define clinically and were
transitioning to more of a pattern of paroxysmal beta seen in the frontal regions.




BACKGROUND: The EEG background is diffusely slow with a mixture of delta and beta. Seizures
seem to be stopping by 5pm. By 9pm there is an intermittent burst suppression pattern noted.
Starting to see more focal sharps in the right frontal region starting around 4 am.



GENERALIZED SLOWING: increasingly slower compatible with pharmacologic coma



FOCAL SLOWING: No change


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): Prominent frontal beta,





SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Occasional (1/hour to <1min) right or left frontal sharp
waves, bifrontal sharp waves




EVENTS: Multiple electrographic seizures were captured, typically 45-90 seconds duration.

Ictal pattern: 13-14 Hz activity L occipital with evolution. Spreads anteriorly and to central regions.
Evolves and slows. Post ictal bilateral delta. On the 7th the ictal pattern has more left frontal
involvement.




EKG: A single EKG lead captured 90 bpm


DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



Seizures stop by 5pm, burst suppression pattern followed.

DAY 3 (10/08/15  6 PM - 10/09/15 , 06:00)

Meds:

Not reported


Clinical: patient is intubated and comatose


BACKGROUND:


Intermittent burst suppression, transitioning to more sustained burst suppression. Suppression is 5-7
seconds in duration, never more than 10. However, by 10 pm the burst suppression is 10 seconds or
greater.


Some more left hemisphere epileptiform activity and some bursts of left hemispheric sharp waves or
spikes, intermittent. Brief bursts of paroxysmal frontal activity with no clinical correlate.



GENERALIZED SLOWING: marked or more than the past



FOCAL SLOWING: No change


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None









SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Frequent (>1/min to <1/10s) in the bursts of cerebral activity
there are primarily left hemispheric sharp waves with some bifrontal sharp waves. Some bursts have
paroxysmal fast activity, left frontal max.




EVENTS: None


EKG: A single EKG lead captured 72 bpm



DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



Burst suppression pattern, with increasing duration of periods of suppression, often as long as 10
seconds toward the end of the 24 hour period.



Reading attending: 



-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 4 (10/09/15, 06:00 - 10/10/15, 06:00)



Meds:

Keppra


Propofol

? Depakote, Zonisamide, Trileptal



INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

Continues to demonstrate burst suppression pattern with continuing suppression lasting up to 20
seconds.


Burst activity lasts up to 2 seconds, with left frontal or bifrontal sharp waves during the activity bursts.

By the end of the 24 hour recording period, although there is no mention of medication change, the
suppression duration has decreased to 5-10 seconds.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

See above



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None






ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.



SEIZURES/EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



EKG: A single lead captured 60 bpm


DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



Burst suppression pattern, with increasing duration of periods of suppression, up to as long as 20
seconds.


However, by the end of this section of the record, although no mention of change in medications,
burst suppression is decreased to 5-10 seconds with bifrontal sharp waves.

DAY 5 (10/10/15, 06:00 - 10/11/15, 09:00)



AEDs:

Propofol, others



Clinical:

On the 10th Propofol dose was changed to 65. During the day, the patient became hypothermic and
was placed in a bear hugger at 13:25 PM. Wide complex QRS emerges during the day on the 10th.
Not all changes in the propofol doses are not documented in the EEG record.




INTERICTAL BACKGROUND:

This EEG starts out as a burst suppression pattern then tranistions to repetitive sharp waves from the
left hemisphere, predominantly from the left temporal hemisphere at 7 AM on the 10th .  The EEG
varies from



discontinuous to slightly discontinuous with left frontal sharp waves.

By 2 am the EEG is relatively continuous with bifrontal or left frontal sharp waves.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: left frontal sharp waves, bifrontal sharp waves, increasing as the EEG
became more continuous.





SEIZURES/EVENTS:



SVT with idioventricular rhythm hypotension at 8:34. Chest compressions began at 8:37:58 and the
code was completed at 9:11. The EEG was flat. The patient was declared dead.



EKG: A single lead captured 90 bpm, suggesting a broadened QRS, worsening over this section of
the record.  The patient's  Rhythm continued to deteriorate at 8:34 leading to cardiac arrest at 8:37



Reading attending: 



-----------------------------------------------------------------

FINAL IMPRESSION:



This is abnormal video EEG due to:


1. Multiple clinical seizures from the left hemisphere, primarily left posterior


2. Prominent epileptiform activity, which persisted even with burst suppression.

3. SVT /wide complex rhythm followed by cardiac arrest and cessation of cerebral activity




FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:



These findings were reported to the clinical team at the time of the recording in October, 2015


Reading attending: 


I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
