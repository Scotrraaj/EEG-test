HISTORY: 82 y.o. female with a history of aphasia and change in mental status referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.  MEDICATIONS: Current Outpatient Prescriptions: carvedilol (COREG) 6.25 mg tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth twice a day aspirin EC 81 mg EC tablet, Take 81 mg by mouth daily. atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. furosemide (LASIX) 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. glimepiride (AMARYL) 2 mg tablet, Take 2 mg by mouth every morning (before breakfast). clopidogrel (PLAVIX) 75 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.  No current facility-administered medications for this visit.  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1 (01/14/16, 12:15PM - 01/15//2016, 06:00)  BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous and consists predominantly of low voltage beta activity with admixed theta.   A fragmented posterior dominant rhythm achieving 10Hz was present, more prominent on the right than left.  The background is reactive, and  variable.  There was a persistent asymmetries in amplitude with the left side showing diffuse attenuation compared to the right side. Focal slowing however was not observed.  Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured..  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured sinus rhythm with frequent premature beats.  DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an ABNORMAL 24 hours videoEEG due to focal attenuation over the left hemisphere. No electrographic or clinical seizures were seen. EKG revealed frequent premature beats. These findings were communicated to the primary team. Occasional   -----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2 (01/15/2016, 06:00 - 01/15/2016, 03:00PM)  BACKGROUND: No change  GENERALIZED SLOWING: None  FOCAL SLOWING: No change  PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None  SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single EKG lead captured sinus rhythm with premature beats.   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  This is an ABNORMAL 24 hours videoEEG due to focal attenuation over the left hemisphere. No electrographic or clinical seizures were seen. EKG revealed frequent premature beats. These findings were communicated to the primary team. Occasional
