History:	64 YR MALE PRESENTED FRIDAY S/P CATH. POST CATH PT HAD CHEST PAIN.
	 SLOW CODED PT FOR 15-20 MIN. WENT TO CATH LAB AGAIN, HAD ECHMO 
	PLACED. SINCE THEN HAS BEEN UNRESPONSIVE. NO SEDATION
Medications:	INSULIN, ZOSYN, HYDROCORTISONE. PROTONIX, VANCOMYCIN, ALBUMIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by severe 
attenuation of all activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic 
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory, 
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR could not be seen.  There is a continuous rhtymic artifact during the 
entire study likely realted to the assist machine.
Summary of Findings:
	Attenuation, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse attenuation.  These findings are etiologically
 nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
