START DATE OF STUDY: 09/24/2015 at 12:07

END DATE OF STUDY: 9/26/2015 at 13:36




RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU

EEG TYPE: LTM






HISTORY:


a 55 y.o. female with a history of aphasia and

right leg weakness, found to have a left frontal hemorrhagic

lesion, noted to have leg twitching.




MEDICATIONS: propofol, Keppra




SEDATION: propofol



TECHNIQUE:


A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the

International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a

NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and


included a single channel of EKG.






DAY 1 (9/24/2015, 12:07 - 9/25/2015 08:00)




BACKGROUND:


The waking background is continuous, asymmetric, and poorly

organized.

The right hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of delta,

with admixed theta and alpha.


The left hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of theta

and alpha with admixed delta, with somewhat attenuated faster


frequencies.

There is moderate diffuse slowing.



There is no posterior dominant rhythm.




The background is variable, and there are state changes. During


periods of sleep (<15 min), the background consists of theta and

alpha with 1-2 second periods of diffuse attenuation. Sleep

transients are absent.




Note that the leads are disconnected between 9/24 04:42 and 9/25

07:29.




PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Frequent right parasagittal sharp-and-wave complexes. As the

record progresses, these can shift focus from frontal (F4/C4 max)


to posterior (P4/T6 max). At times these become periodic at 1 Hz,

without evolution, for runs of <15 sec.



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or


detected.




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal video long term EEG due to:


1. Moderate diffuse slowing and background disorganization

2. Right hemisphere focal slowing


3. Left hemisphere attenuation of faster frequencies

4. Frequent right parasagittal sharp-and-wave complexes that


become periodic for <15 second runs without evolution. There are

no electrographic seizures.

DAY 2 (9/25/2015, 08:00 - 9/26/2015, 08:00)

BACKGROUND: no change

GENERALIZED SLOWING: no change

FOCAL SLOWING: no change


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none

SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:


1. Occasional right parasagittal sharp-and-wave complexes that

become periodic at 1 Hz for <5 second runs without evolution.

EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events




DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION

Background is unchanged on this day.


Epileptiform activity shows improvement in amount of epileptiform

activity.



Reading attending: 







DAY 3 (9/26/2015, 08:00 - 9/26/2015, 13:36)

BACKGROUND: no change

GENERALIZED SLOWING: no change

FOCAL SLOWING: no change


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none

SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change




DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


No change from Day 2




Reading attending: 




------------------------------------------------------

FINAL IMPRESSION:

This is an abnormal video EEG due to:


1. Moderate diffuse slowing and background disorganization

2. Right hemisphere focal slowing


3. Left hemisphere attenuation of faster frequencies

4. Right parasagittal sharp-and-wave complexes, periodic at

times, that improve in frequency and periodicity beginning on Day






FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:


These findings are consistent with right hemisphere dysfunction

and independent left hemisphere dysfunction, with superimposed

right parasagittal epileptogenic discharges.  Attenuation of

faster frequencies seen over the left hemisphere can be


consistent with cortical injury, or factors that increase the

distance between the recording electrodes and brain parenchyma,


such as subdural or scalp hematoma.

There were no clinical or electrographic seizures reported or

detected during this study.
