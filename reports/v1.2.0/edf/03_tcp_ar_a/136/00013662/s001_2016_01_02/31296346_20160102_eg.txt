DATE OF STUDY: 01/02/2016- ongoing

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU


EEG TYPE: Continuous video EEG monitoring, LTM





HISTORY:

a 77 y.o. male with a history of right failure

who fell while bicycling and was found in V. fib arrest.  It is


thought that he may have had a prolonged anoxic insult prior to

resuscitation.  Now referred for routine EEG for hypothermic

protocol.




MEDICATIONS:

Current Outpatient Prescriptions:


bumetanide (BUMEX) 1 mg tablet, Take 2 tabs twice daily

metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 100 mg tablet, Take 100 mg by mouth 2

times daily.


lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth

daily.

digoxin (LANOXIN) 125 mcg tablet, Take 125 mcg by mouth daily.


aspirin (BAYER) 325 mg Tablet tablet, Take 650 mg by mouth daily.




insulin glargine (LANTUS) 100 unit/mL injection, Inject 10 Units

into the skin nightly.


amoxicillin-clavulanate (AUGMENTIN) 875-125 mg per tablet, Take 1

tablet by mouth 2 times daily. X 9 days




No current facility-administered medications for this visit.






SEDATION: Propofol drip, administered during hypothermia,

discontinued at midnight on the third




TECHNIQUE:

Continuous digital video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG)

was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2


electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically

satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. the


patient was cooled on the evening of Jan 2, 2016.  Rewarming

began on the evening of the third.  The patient reached a normal

body temperature around 11 AM on January 4, 2016









-----------------------------------------------------------------



DAY 1(Jan 2, 2016 - 1/3/2016, 06:00)




BACKGROUND: The hyperacute EEG demonstrates initially a

suppressed pattern.  Then, there is a burst suppression pattern


with bursts of rhythmic high amplitude mixed frequency activity.

This was followed by a more discontinuous pattern.  In the

initial section of cooling, there were sections with a prolonged,

markedly suppressed pattern with isolated bursts of delta.  There


was no reactivity or variability.  Variable patterns including

isolated cerebral activity or lower voltage, slow activity can be


seen from 9 PM to 6 AM .




GENERALIZED SLOWING: see above




FOCAL SLOWING: none




PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: none




EVENTS: none




EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 120





DAY  IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION


This hyperacute EEG, which began shortly after the cardiac arrest

and before the use of hypothermic and demonstrated initially a


suppressed pattern then, a burst suppression pattern and then

once again a suppressed pattern. Hypothermia and propofol were

utilized toproduce a suppressed pattern.  Therefore, no inference

can


be made in regard to cerebral function at this time.   There were

no epileptiform features noted.  No subclinical seizures were


identified

DAY 2 (1/3/2106, 06:00 - 1/4/2016, 06:00)

During this section of the record, the patient is rewarmed.


Propofol was discontinued




BACKGROUND: Initially, this EEG demonstrates a markedly

suppressed pattern.  Over time, a lower voltage more continuous


pattern emerges. By the afternoon of the fourth, a more

continuous pattern is noted but an asymmetry is emerging with a


more suppressed pattern noted in the left temporal region




GENERALIZED SLOWING: See above



FOCAL SLOWING: See above




PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None significant




SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or Detected




EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 86






DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

With rewarming, and discontinuation of propofol, a more

continuous cerebral pattern is emerging.  This remains an acute


process and ongoing monitoring and assessment is essential to

provide any prognostic information

DAY 3 (1/4/2106, 06:00 - 1/52016, 15:23 PM)


During this section of the record, the patient is normothermic,

there were no sedatives given




BACKGROUND: This is a low voltage, slow pattern.  The previously

described asymmetries give way to an increasingly low-voltage,

suppressed and more symmetric pattern.


Examination of the patient on January 5 does not elicit

reactivity or variability in the EEG.


GENERALIZED SLOWING: See above. Marked, severe.  Low voltage




FOCAL SLOWING: See above




PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None significant




SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: none



EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or Detected




EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 96






Overall IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This EEG monitoring session began for acute study in a patient

who had suffered a cardiac arrest.  Initially, it was suppressed.


Some cerebral activity was noted hours later 9 PM, but then the

patient received hypothermia and pharmacologic sedation with


propofol.  As these therapies were withdrawn, cerebral activity

gradually returned but, the pattern that return was a markedly

abnormal pattern.  Unfortunately, over time the slow, low-voltage

and suppressed pattern also seems to be waning when this


monitoring session was terminated on January 5.  No seizures were

recorded.  There were no epileptiform features
