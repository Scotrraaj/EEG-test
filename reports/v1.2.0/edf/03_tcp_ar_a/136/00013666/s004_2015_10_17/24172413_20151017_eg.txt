HISTORY: 52 y.o. male who presents with anoxic brain injury and subsequent myoclonic status epilepticus.  Patient undergoing hypothermia protocol.  MEDICATIONS: Vimpat, versed, phenobarbital, fentanyl   SEDATION: versed  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.   DAY 1   BACKGROUND: There is no PDR or AP gradient. The background consists of burst-suppression pattern.  Early in the recording suppression is severe with no bursts of activity for over 1 min. By the end of the recording epoch, bursts occur every few seconds.  Majority of bursts consist of epileptic and clinical seizures.  Clinically, there are low amplitude rapid head and body jerks.  Electrographically, seizures start with moderate amplitude rhythmic diffuse 8-9 Hz activity that gradually decreases in frequency.  Sleep was not captured.  EKG: A single lead captures heart rate of 72 bpm.  IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal 12-hour long term video EEG due to: (1) burst suppression (2) myoclonic status epilepticus  These findings indicate marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction with marked cortical irritability and in post-anoxic patient indicate poor chance of meaningful neurological recovery.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------  DAY 2    BACKGROUND: there is evolution of bursts with bursts becoming shorter but more frequent.  Each burst consists of high amplitude diffuse frontally predominant spikes and polyspikes and correlates clinically with brief body jerk (jerk duration depends on the duration of the burst)   DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION  Evolution of myoclonic status epilepticus despite escalation in medical management of the condition.
