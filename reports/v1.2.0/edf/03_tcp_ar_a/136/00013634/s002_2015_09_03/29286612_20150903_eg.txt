DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm. The overall background includes age appropriate quantities of theta. Intermittent focal slowing was noted from the left hemisphere with shifting variability including mid temporal or posterior temporal regions. Brief drowsiness was characterized by an increase in theta.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
