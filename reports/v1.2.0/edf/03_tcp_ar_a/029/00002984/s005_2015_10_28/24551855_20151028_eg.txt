History:		61 year old woman with a history of left meningioma resection, now presents for a followÂ­ up EEG.
Medications:	Xanax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
	
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Diffuse excess beta activity is present. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No clear sustained focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and results in intermittent left anterior temporal polymorphic theta activity. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.

Summary of Findings:

Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, marked, left temporal, anterior, only seen during hyperver Beta, excessive
No epileptiform discharges No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
	
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 23-minute EEG due to intermittent mild left anterior temporal focal slowing that became apparent during hyperventilation. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin. Excess beta activity could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
