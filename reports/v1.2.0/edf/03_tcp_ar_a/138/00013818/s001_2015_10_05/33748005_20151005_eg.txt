 HISTORY: 73 y.o. male with a history of strokes, now presents with change in mental status, concerning for seizures.    MEDICATIONS: None listed  SEDATION: None  TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG    BACKGROUND: There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The waking background consists of prominent monomorphic 3-4 Hz delta activity posteriorly. It is also seen anteriorly but to a lesser degree.  There is no evolution.  There is under-riding fast activity posteriorly and under-riding slow polymorphic delta activity.  Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.   PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):  None  EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:  None  EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected  EKG: A single lead captured heart rate of 72 bpm.   IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal 19 hour long term video EEG due to: Moderate diffuse slowing that is most pronounced over the posterior quadrants.  Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. continuous focal slowing is indicative of focal structural abnormalities over the posterior quadrants.  No electrographic seizures are captured.
