HISTORY:

25 y.o. male referred for Video EEG for


suspected seizures.  Persistent dysautonomia and agitation,

ocular and facial twitching.



MEDICATIONS: Versed 14 mcg per hour, 200 mcg Fentanyl, 24 mg

Ativan, Ambien 40 mg per day, Oxacillin, Clonidine, propranolol,

Ceftriaxone, intermittent esmolol. Depakote 500 mg q 12.



SEDATION: See above



TECHNIQUE:

This video EEG recording was performed with 23-channel bipolar

EEG connection, including all standard 10-20 electrode placements


as well as T1 and T2.  Additional channels were available for




areas of special interest. Seizure and spike detection software

was used. No clinical events were noted.



DAY 1: Sept 10 to Sept 11


EEG BACKGROUND:

The  Background is comprised of a continuous monomorphic 1.5-4 Hz

40-60 uV delta pattern. This is posteriorly predominant.  On

occasion, there is low voltage 13.5 or 17 Hz delta seen riding on


the delta activity. This can be best differentiated from muscle

artifact on the 11th.  Wakefulness includes eye movement.  The


sleep record is similar to the active pattern. Sedatives were

adjusted due to agitation. There are no  normal sleep transients

PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

See above



SPIKE DETECTIONS:


Artifact.


EPILEPTIFORM Seizures

None identified.



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:


None


EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during


this study.



PUSH BUTTONS:

No push buttons were recorded

AUTOMATED SEIZURE DETECTIONS:

No epileptiform seizures were noted in this section of the EEG.


Artifact only.



HEART RATE:

A heart rate of 100 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.


______________________________________________




IMPRESSION:


This is an abnormal continuous video EEG:

Replacement of normal background with a posteriorly predominant

delta pattern

Intermittent theta pattern


Delta-Brush




CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is LTM EEG supports a severe bi-hemispheric disturbance of

CNS function. Although the patient had many CNS agents, the


pattern on the 11th is characteristic of that described in NMDA

receptor encephalitis.  EEG monitoring will continue  .

sleep record is similar to the Wake pattern. There are no

normal sleep transients.

There are nor normal morphologies of wakefulness, aside from eye


movement and automaticisms of the left hand.
