DATE OF STUDY: 09/26/16

RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient


EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy





HISTORY:

 a 44 y.o. MAN PRESENTS FOR FOLLOW UP PMHX SIG FOR SEIZURES SINCE
1996 - REMOVAL OF 2 AVM'S , RIGHT TEMPORAL - LAST SZ  WEEK AGO- STARRING
SPELL LASTING 30SEC. WITH RETURN TO BASELINE.




MEDICATIONS:

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.


No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

Facility-Administered Medications Ordered in Other Visits:

multivitamin (THERA) tablet 1 tablet


OXcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) tablet 450 mg

PHENobarbital (LUMINAL) tablet 130 mg

sodium chloride 0.9 % injection (flush) 10 mL


enoxaparin (LOVENOX) injection 40 mg

topiramate (TOPAMAX) tablet 50 mg





SEDATION: None



TECHNIQUE:

A  Digital Video 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20
system with T1/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record
and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.




EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is
characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.




During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



Sleep is not captured



There is continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right posterior temporal region with
an associated increase in amplitude an faster frequencies consistent with a breach.



EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

Occasional T4/T6 sharp waves, spikes and polyspikes are seen.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:



Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces
no effect.



Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.



EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:



A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:

1. Focal sharp wave, spike and polyspike in the right posterior temporal region


2. Continuous focal slowing in the right posterior temporal region and breach


CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is an abnormal awake and drowsy  routine EEG due to focal sharp wave, spike and polyspike in
the right posterior temporal region, which is indicative of an potentially epileptogenic focus in that
region.

In addition there is continuous focal slowing in the right posterior temporal region.  This is consistent
with the known AVM and resection.
