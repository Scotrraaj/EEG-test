RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: 







HISTORY:

 a 44 year old localization related epilepsy possibly 2/2 right temporal AVM s/p
clipping/resection in November 2010.



Semiology CPS: The semiology of his seizures begins with staring, confusion and automatism when
he is fumbling with stuff. He denies any shaking with these episodes or any warnings preceding his


seizure. It begins with feeling light headed, feels a strange taste in mouth followed by automatism
like lip smacking, touching other people or objects followed by stiffening/curling of his arms and legs,
lasting for 5mins. Post ictal periods lasting for 15-20 minutes.





Current AEDs : PHB 64.8 mg 2 tabs HS and Topamax 100 mg AM and 200 mg HS and Trileptal 300
mg BID






Prior AEDs :  Dilantin, Keppra, Tegretol




He smokes Marijuana and smokes tobacco occasionally. Denies any other drug use.




Epilepsy Risk Factors: No complications during birth. Denies a family history of seizures, history of
head trauma, previous CNS infection, febrile seizures or developmental delay. Has AVM




Continuous video EEG is initiated for:  Recording of seizures for presurgical evaluation.



Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant
mortality and morbidity risk.  Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best
treatment options.  If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual
mortality rate.



- Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while
medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures
causing injury or status epilepticus;


- The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to
provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;


- The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they
arise, including nurses to document patients exam


There have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not
a "low risk" service



CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:

A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.  The patient then
underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.  Scalp electrodes were
placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.
Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case.  Impedances were measured and verified to be
below 5 Kohms.  EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to
computer hard drive.  Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest
and reviewed in detail.





Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of
epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.  For 24 hours each weekday (and 12-24
hours on weekend) the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in
person or on call 24 hours per day.  The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a
registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing.  During times when a
technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and
nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.












The  spike and seizure detection computer program was used to screen the EEG in real time for
electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.
Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as
selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:

Interictal Findings:




Ictal Findings:


The patient had no clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the
epilepsy monitoring unit.



SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:

1. Localization related epilepsy





EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:


1. Localization related epilepsy possibly arising from the temporal lobes.



CONCLUSION:

was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 5 days with continuous video EEG.
This was an non diagnostic EMU monitoring session due to not capturing any events.



The interictal EEG is characterized by frequent sharp waves seen frequently in the right posterior and
mid-temporal region as well as occasional bifrontal and left anterior temporal region . The
epileptiform discharges indicate a potentially epileptogenic focus in that region. Focal slowing in the
right posterior temporal region indicates a focal structural lesion in that region, which is consistent
with the known AVM.






The patient was weaned off his AEDs over the course of her admission. He was restarted on his
medications on the day of discharge from the hospital along with an ativan taper as he wanted to
leave despite understanding the risk of seizures.
