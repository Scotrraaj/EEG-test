History:	54 year old man who presents with an episode concerning for a focal seizure.
Medications:	Ativan this am
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG 
	electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates 
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over 
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal 
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric 
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  BETS (benign epileptiform transients of sleep) or SSS 
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
	BETS (benign epileptiform transients of sleep) or SSS (small sharp spikes)
	No epileptiform discharges
	Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 80-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
