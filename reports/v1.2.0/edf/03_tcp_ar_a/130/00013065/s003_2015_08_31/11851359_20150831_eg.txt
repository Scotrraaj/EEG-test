CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 56-year-old woman with infected

pacemaker, sepsis, combative spell, seizure on August 31st.



MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin, VPA, Ambien others



INTRODUCTION:  Continuous Digital video EEG monitoring was

performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with

1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not


possible.  Seizure and spike detection software was used.




-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 1 (Aug 31, 2015,  - 09//01/2015, )






BACKGROUND: EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with mixed

frequency, theta, alpha frequency activity, and occasional bursts


of frontal rhythmic delta activity.  There are sections with a

reasonably well organized low voltage wake pattern, but scant


alpha There are handful of bursts of shifting, slowing.

Morphologies of stage 2 sleep included vertex waves spindles were

noted.



GENERALIZED SLOWING: noted in the first few hours



FOCAL SLOWING: intermittent, left frontotemporal


PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None



SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Occasional (1/hour to <1min) Left

Frontotemporal sharp waves, some discrete and low voltage



EVENTS: two seizures were identified, respectively 32 and 42

seconds in duration. The patient appears to be drowsy and has her

head turned to the right with each. No clinical signs are noted


during the discharges but the patient seems to arouse and to have

chewing movements when the seizure ends.


08/31/2015: 1:07 PM left temporal rhythmic mixed theta delta is

followed by periodic delta with left mid to posterior temporal

sharp wave and then abrupt arousal and chew artifact

08/31/2015 2:16 PM left temporal rhythmic delta is followed by


rhythmic 5Hz theta and then periodic mixed theta delta with

subtle anterior temporal sharp, and then abrupt arousal and chew


artifact

EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 60-90 BPM




DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



Two subtle clinical seizures were noted, emanating from left

frontotemporal region.




-----------------------------------------------------------------


DAY 2 (09/012015, 06:00 - 09/02/2015,   10 AM)

Medications: not provided.


There is a great deal of electrode artifact in the first hours of

this section, and again on the morning of the 2nd. The patient is


more awake and moving about on 9/2 in the AM.

BACKGROUND: EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern, low voltage

with mixed

frequency, theta, alpha frequency activity, and occasional bursts


of frontal rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA). There are handful of

bursts of shifting, slowing.


Morphologies of stage 2 sleep included vertex waves


GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change



FOCAL SLOWING: No change



PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): FIRDA


SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare (<1hour) Left

Frontotemporal sharp waves.



EVENTS: None



EKG: A single EKG lead captured HR 80 BPM




DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION



Limited by artifact, but no seizures.  L temporal sharp waves and

background slowing unchanged. Mental status seems to be improved


on the morning of the 2nd, but EEG electrodes were not optimal.




IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:

Abnormal 48 hour continuous EEG monitor due to:

2 seizures, with left temporal localization and few clinical

features.


Generalized background slowing

Left temporal sharp waves


Shifting slowing

FIRDA
